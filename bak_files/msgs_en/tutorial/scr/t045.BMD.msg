[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][n]You can perform a [f 0 1 2]Persona Fusion[f 0 1 0],[n]where you fuse multiple Personas[n]together to summon a new one.[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][n][f 0 1 2]You will lose the original Personas[f 0 1 0], but[n]the resulting one will inherit some of[n]their skills, and its level may be higher[n][f 0 1 2](although it can't exceed your own level)[f 0 1 0].[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][n]Your own level is called the [f 0 1 2]Wild Level[f 0 1 0],[n]and it is the highest in the party.[n][f 1 1][e]

[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][n]You can also prevent losing a Persona[n]to fusion by making a copy of it[n]beforehand. In the 2-Layer Fusion[n]menu, press the [f 0 1 2]X Button[f 0 1 0] while the[n]Persona is selected, and you can then[n]turn the [f 0 1 2]copy[f 0 1 0] option on or off.[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][n]If you don't make a copy of either[n]Persona, then fusing them costs no[n]money. They will simply be lost.[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][n]If you do decide to copy a Persona,[n]then you will have to [f 0 1 2]pay yen to fuse it[f 0 1 0].[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][n]The price will be the same as when you[n]summon a Persona from the "Persona[n]Film." Try many different fusion combos[n]to make your party super-strong![n][f 1 1][e]
