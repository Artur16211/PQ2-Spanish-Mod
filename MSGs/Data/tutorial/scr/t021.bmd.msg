[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]Support Skills do not use SP. Rather, they[n]use the [f 0 1 2]Party Meter[f 0 1 0].[n][f 1 1][e]

[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]　[n]Throughout battle, the Party Meter fills[n]whenever [f 0 1 2]a party member attacks a[n]Shadow[f 0 1 0], and also whenever [f 0 1 2]a party[n]member takes damage[f 0 1 0]. The gauge is[n]completely full at 5 points.[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]　[n]Support Skills allow the battle navigator[n]to join in! And since the Party Meter will[n]replenish as long as you keep fighting,[n]you should use Support Skills often.[n][f 1 1][e]
