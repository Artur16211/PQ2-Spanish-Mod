[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]　[n]At the [f 0 1 2]box office[f 0 1 0], you can accept a[n]special screening request. You'll be[n]given a mission, and if you manage to[n]complete it, you'll [f 0 1 2]receive a reward[f 0 1 0].[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]　[n]The special screening will end when[n]you complete the mission, and [f 0 1 2]special[n]screenings that have ended cannot be[n]accessed again[f 0 1 0]. That's why it's worth it[n]to search every inch of the labyrinth[n]before fulfilling the mission. Of course,[n]you can also just unlock more special[n]screenings by continuing your journey[n]or by [f 0 1 2]meeting certain requirements[f 0 1 0].[n][f 1 1][e]
