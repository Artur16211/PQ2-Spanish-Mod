[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]　In addition to their [f 0 1 2]main Persona[f 0 1 2][n], each teammate can have an additional one: a freely interchangeable [f 0 1 2][n][n]Sub-Persona[f 0 1 0].[n][f 1 1][e]

[msg BTL_TUTORIAL_mes04]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]Open the menu with the [f 0 1 2]X Button[f 0 1 0][n]and select [f 0 1 2]PERSONA[f 0 1 0][n]to assign Sub-Personas.[n][f 1 1][e]

[msg BTL_TUTORIAL_mes02]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]This lets each teammate have the skills of[n]two Personas: the main and the sub.[n][f 1 1][e]

[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]A Sub-Persona's HP and SP are added to that[n]of the party member as [f 0 1 2]a bonus[f 0 1 0][n].[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]Bonus HP and SP will be [f 0 1 2]automatically replenished at the start of any battle[f 0 1 0][n][n]![n][f 1 1][e]

[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]　Assigning a Sub-Persona whose [f 0 1 2]level is very low[f 0 1 0][n]compared to the main Persona will [f 0 1 2][n]reduce the power of some attack skills[f 0 1 0][n]. 　[n]Always try to give your teammates a Sub-[n]Persona with a level close to that of[n]their main Persona.[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]　 You can assign Sub-Personas at [f 0 1 2]any time while you're not in battle[f 0 1 0][n][n]. But once you are in battle, you can't[n]use any Sub- Personas that weren't[n]assigned to someone.[n][f 1 1][e]
