[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 3 1 1 0 0 0]There are countless other worlds[n]that exist parallel to this one...[n][f 1 3 65535][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 3 1 1 0 0 0]And indeed, countless parallel versions[n]of yourself. Even now, they seek to[n]contact you from their own worlds.[n][f 1 3 65535][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 4 6 33 12 0 0][f 3 1 1 0 0 0]If you wish to communicate with these[n]other versions of you, you will need[n]the [f 0 1 2]P-Book[f 0 1 0].[n][f 1 3 65535][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 3 1 1 0 0 0]Your team's information and one[n]Sub-Persona can be included within the[n]P-Book.[n][f 1 3 65535][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 3 1 1 0 0 0]When you exchange a Book with another[n]you,[f 0 1 2] you'll both be able to summon the[n]Sub-Personas within the Books[f 0 1 0].[n][f 1 3 65535][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 3 1 1 0 0 0]Using this ability will give you the[n]opportunity to obtain powerful[n]Sub-Personas.[n][f 1 3 65535][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 4 6 33 12 0 0][f 3 1 1 0 0 4157]Now then, you must decide on a[n]name to differentiate yourself from[n]the other you.[n][f 1 3 65535][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 3 1 1 0 0 0]It will be a name for the P-Book...[n]So this shall be known as your [f 0 1 2]P-Book name[f 0 1 0].[n][f 1 3 65535][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 3 1 1 0 0 0]You can easily change this later,[n]so set it as whatever you please.[n][f 1 3 65535][f 1 1][e]
