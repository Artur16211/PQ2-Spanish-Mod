[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 3 1 1 0 0 0]Once you outline the walls, I think it will[n]be easier to identify both dead ends and[n]places we still need to explore.[n][f 1 3 65535][f 1 1][e]

[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 4 6 28 12 0 0][f 3 1 1 0 0 0]That way, we can search every inch of[n]the movie... It may even lead us to some[n]unexpected treasures.[n][f 1 3 65535][f 1 1][e]

[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 3 1 1 0 0 0]But perhaps it'd be better if you outlined[n]the walls as well?[n][f 1 3 65535][f 1 1][e]

[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 4 6 24 12 0 4][f 3 1 1 0 0 0]Indeed. I imagine that will help us see[n]both dead ends and paths we haven't[n]yet traveled.[n][f 1 3 65535][f 1 1][e]

[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 3 1 1 0 0 0][f 6 1 3 0 0 1]It may also allow for smoother[n]exploration, and there'll be less chance[n]of us overlooking treasures as well.[n][f 1 3 65535][f 1 1][e]
