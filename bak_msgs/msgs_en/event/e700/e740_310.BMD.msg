[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 3 1 1 0 0 0][f 6 1 2 0 0 10]We have Hikari-chan with us, so it[n]would be best to try and avoid enemies[n]who would give us trouble in a fight.[n][f 1 3 65535][f 1 1][e]

[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 4 6 23 6 0 1][f 3 1 1 0 0 23016]Then, what should we do now?[n][f 1 3 65535][f 1 1][e]

[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]Let's consult Noir.[f 2 7 1 20 0 32][e]

[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 4 6 5 2 0 6][f 3 1 1 0 0 5069]Yeah―it worked once for us already,[n]so I think we should try it again.[n][f 1 3 65535][f 1 1][e]

[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 3 1 1 0 0 0][f 6 1 2 0 0 4]Why don't we ask Noir for advice, as our[n]resident axe expert?[n][f 1 3 65535][f 1 1][e]

[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 4 7 6 0 0][f 4 6 27 0 0 0][f 3 1 1 0 0 27011]Well... axes have a rather short attack[n]range, so it's best not to get too close.[n][f 1 3 65535][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 4 6 27 6 1 0][f 3 1 1 0 0 0]Also, an axe that large seems awfully[n]heavy, so I doubt it can swing that[n]continually―only one whack at a time.[n][f 1 3 65535][f 1 1][e]

[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 4 6 24 4 1 1][f 3 1 1 0 0 0]I see... "Don't approach it if possible,"[n]and, "Time it well if you must approach[n]it," seem to be the best tactics here.[n][f 1 3 65535][f 1 1][e]

[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 3 1 1 0 0 0][f 6 1 2 0 0 4]Doesn't it seem like it would be the most[n]dangerous when it's at its angriest?[n][f 1 3 65535][f 1 1][e]
