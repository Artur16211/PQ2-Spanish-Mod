[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 4 6 28 12 0 6][f 3 1 1 0 0 28068]That's right. Each letter in GROW is[n]an abbreviation for one of the warp[n]point colors.[n][f 1 3 65535][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 3 1 1 0 0 0]Green, red, orange, and white.[n]If you take the first letter of each[n]of these colors, they spell...[n][f 1 3 65535][f 1 1][e]

[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][f 4 6 28 2 0 6][f 3 1 1 0 0 0]So the paper was telling us to use[n]the green, red, orange, and white[n]warp points in that order.[n][f 1 3 65535][f 1 1][e]
