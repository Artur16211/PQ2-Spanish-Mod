[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][n]For a [f 0 1 2]Sacrifice Fusion[f 0 1 0] you will need[n]money, and also a Sub-Persona to serve[n]as the sacrifice. This process can[n]strengthen both your [f 0 1 2]main Persona[f 0 1 0][n]and your [f 0 1 2]Sub-Persona[f 0 1 0], but not at the[n]same time.[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][n]Your strengthened Personas will[n]expedite your investigation and perform[n]better in combat. Consider Sacrifice[n]Fusions whenever you have some extra[n]money and extra Sub-Personas.[n][f 1 1][e]
