[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1]Some Shadows have a special barrier[n]known as the [f 0 1 2]Affinity Barrier[f 0 1 0].[n][f 1 1][e]

[msg BTL_TUTORIAL_mes02]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][n]When its Affinity Barrier is up, a Shadow[n]is resistant to your attacks' affinities.[n]However, if you [f 0 1 2]deal enough damage[f 0 1 0] or[n][f 0 1 2]meet certain other conditions[f 0 1 0], the barrier[n]will deactivate, and the Shadow's[n]resistance will change.[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][n]When the Affinity Barrier is deactivated,[n]the [f 0 1 2]Shadow will visibly change[f 0 1 0]. This will[n]also be reflected in the Shadow's data if[n]you Analyze it.[n][f 1 1][e]
