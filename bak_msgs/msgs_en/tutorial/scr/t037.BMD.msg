[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][n]The [f 0 1 2]Arrange[f 0 1 0] option lets you place [f 0 1 2]up to[n]five allies[f 0 1 0] in your formation, three of[n]which can be in either the [f 0 1 2]front row[f 0 1 0],[n]or the [f 0 1 2]back row[f 0 1 0].[n][f 1 1][e]
[f 0 5 65278][f 2 1][n]Allies in your front row will be targeted[n]more frequently, but they'll be able to[n]hit the enemies' back row with physical[n]attacks. Meanwhile, allies in your back[n]row won't be targeted as much, but[n]they also cannot reach the enemies'[n]back row with their physical attacks.[n][f 1 1][e]
