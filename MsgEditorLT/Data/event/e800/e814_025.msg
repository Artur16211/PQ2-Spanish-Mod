Oh, I just remembered. Did you happen to[n]see any places covered in vines around[n]here?

[msg MSG_001 [Yosuke]]
You mean those doors with the vines up[n]top?
If that's what you're talking about, I[n]saw plenty of those when I was separated[n]from you guys.

[msg MSG_002 [Haru]]
Mhm. There should be medicinal herbs[n]growing just past those vines.

[msg MSG_003 [Yukiko]]
Wow, Noir, I didn't know you knew so[n]much about plants.

[msg MSG_004 [Haru]]
I'm just around them often. I'm nothing[n]compared to the experts.

[msg MSG_005 [Ann]]
It is amazing, though. She's always[n]getting herself covered in mud taking[n]care of the school's flower beds.

[msg MSG_006 [Yusuke]]
Not only that, but she's been growing[n]her own vegetable garden as well.

[msg MSG_007 [P4 Hero]]
She grows her own vegetable garden...?[n]I'd like to hear more about that[n]sometime.

[msg MSG_008 [Kanji]]
Y'know, she don't seem like the daughter[n]of a big company president.

[msg MSG_009 [Yosuke]]
Yeah, but... it's cool. I think that's[n]what makes her so great!

[msg MSG_010 [Teddie]]
Such a beautiful and kind-hearted[n]girl... Her compassion is truly moving!

[msg MSG_011 [Haru]]
Y-You guys are over-exaggerating...
It's nothing noble like that. I just do[n]it because I want to...

[msg MSG_012 [Yukiko]]
...Well, I'm jealous you have something[n]you can be passionate about.

[msg MSG_013 [Haru]]
...Yukiko-chan?

[msg MSG_014 [Yukiko]]
Oh, sorry. I'm just thinking aloud.
We have to find the dinosaur and protect[n]him. Let's hurry.

[msg MSG_015 [Haru]]
......!
Hey, do you guys hear that? That cry...

[msg MSG_016 [Yukiko]]
Yeah! It's coming from over there!

[msg MSG_017 [Rise]]
There's something to the northeast! I'm[n]surprised you guys noticed.

[msg MSG_018 [Haru]]
Let's go, Joker. He needs our help.
