Thank you most kindly for obtaining what[n]I requested.
This is beautiful indeed. I will take[n]excellent care of it.

[msg MSG_001 [Hikari]]
I'm glad you like it... We worked really[n]hard to catch it.

[sel SEL_002 top]
What'll you do with it?
You like butterflies?

[msg MSG_003 [Elizabeth]]
Nothing in particular. Though...
I would like to spend some time[n]relaxing, watching it dance in flight.

[msg MSG_004 [Elizabeth]]
I suppose you could say that.
Seeing it weave and dance in the air[n]inspires a certain calm.

[msg MSG_005 [Yukari]]
It got a little bumpy near the end, but[n]I think I enjoyed it.
Let's go again sometime, Hikari-chan.

[msg MSG_006 [Hikari]]
Thanks... I had fun too. I hope you'll[n]let me come with you again sometime.
