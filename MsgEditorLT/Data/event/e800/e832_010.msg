Yet another special screening has been[n]added.
It seems this screening will take place[n]within Ciudad Kamo.
Having lost their hero, the townspeople[n]need encouragement as they set off[n]toward a new tomorrow...
Such is the heartfelt setup for this[n]showing.

[msg MSG_001 [Makoto]]
Encouraging the people... This seems a[n]little different from what we're[n]normally tasked with.

[msg MSG_002 [Ryuji]]
Well, we are the ones who took down[n]Kamoshidaman...
I won't exactly say we're responsible,[n]but... you think maybe we should take[n]this one?

[msg MSG_003 [P3 Hero]]
Yeah. We should help if we can.

[msg MSG_004 [Kanji]]
All right, then let's get out there and[n]make it happen!

[msg MSG_005 [Elizabeth]]
Not so faaast! Eliza-blocker on!

[msg MSG_006 [Kanji]]
Wh-What're you doin'...?

[msg MSG_007 [Elizabeth]]
For this special screening, a certain[n]special condition has been[n]implemented...
You will be required to bring a special[n]set of members on this outing.
Said special individuals include: Aigis,[n]Haru Okumura, and Rise Kujikawa!
Those three must take part.

[msg MSG_008 [Teddie]]
Huh? Why's that?

[msg MSG_009 [Elizabeth]]
Well, according to my source...
Those chosen babes gotta use them[n]bomb-ass powers and bring happiness to[n]the hearts of the people, YO!
...So I'm told.

[msg MSG_010 [Junpei]]
There's no way that's what was written[n]down...
So basically, the triple beauties are[n]the stars of this show?

[msg MSG_010_1 [Elizabeth]]
Indeed. I believe it should suffice if[n]you include those three in your active[n]party.

[msg MSG_011 [Haru]]
Beauties...? I'm included in that too?

[msg MSG_012 [Ryuji]]
Heyyy, Beauty Thief on the scene!

[msg MSG_013 [Haru]]
...Shall I wring your neck?

[msg MSG_014 [Ryuji]]
No, I was, uh, just joking!

[msg MSG_015 [Teddie]]
Hrrm... A special girl's-themed[n]screening... This is sure to lead to[n]some girl talk!
In that case, I can't let myself be beat[n]in the looks department!

[msg MSG_016 [Rise]]
Ahaha, you seem pretty fired up, Teddie.[n]You must be confident.

[msg MSG_017 [Teddie]]
I've already told myself I'm going to[n]become the fairest of them all.
Once I empower everyone with my[n]unmatched beauty...
I will enter the secret world of girls[n]and finally know the pleasures of girl[n]talk!

[msg MSG_018 [Aigis]]
This would mean your aspirations to[n]participate in girl talk hinge on this[n]screening.

[msg MSG_019 [Rise]]
Teddie's motivations aside, if the[n]screening requires it, then I guess we[n]don't have much choice.
I'm just a navigator, but I'll do my[n]best!

[msg MSG_020 [Haru]]
Is it all right if we handle this[n]screening,-kun?

[sel SEL_021 top]
It's all you.
I'm a little worried.
I'll do my best too.

[msg MSG_022 [Aigis]]
Understood. We will ensure the mission[n]is a success.

[msg MSG_023 [Teddie]]
Prepare to feast your eyes on my[n]oh-so-refreshing beauty! Here comes[n]Teddie!

[msg MSG_024 [Yosuke]]
I know what you mean. I know all too[n]well...

[msg MSG_025 [Teddie]]
Don't worry! Teddie, beauty amongst[n]beauties, is here to help!

[msg MSG_026 [Yosuke]]
That's exactly WHY we're worried!
Well, it doesn't sound like we'll be[n]fighting any FOEs, so it should be[n]fine... I think?

[msg MSG_027 [P4 Hero]]
That's true. Just don't push yourselves[n]if it gets too tough.

[msg MSG_028 [Junpei]]
Yeah! Honestly, I'm pretty stoked too.
Being surrounded by all these girls...[n]I'm one step closer to Junpei's Harem[n]Dream Team...

[msg MSG_029 [Yukari]]
You know, Junpei...
You're really... REALLY disgusting.

[msg MSG_030 [Junpei]]
Why you gotta shoot me down like that!?

[msg MSG_031 [Rise]]
So, Haru-san and Aigis need to be in the[n]main party, and I'm on navigator duty,[n]right?
Let's head out once-san finishes[n]organizing the party!
