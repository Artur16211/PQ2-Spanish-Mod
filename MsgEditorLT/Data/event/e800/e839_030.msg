[msg MSG_000 [Cheerful Flower]]
Ohhh... The glorious sun wheels across[n]the sky...

[msg MSG_001 [Relaxed Flower]]
While the birds a-twitter welcome it[n]nigh.

[msg MSG_002 [Cheerful Flower]]
And I behold it with mine worshipful[n]eye...

[msg MSG_003 [Ryuji]]
What!? The voices came from these[n]things!?

[msg MSG_004 [P3 Fem Protag]]
They must be the flowers we were looking[n]for. They might know something,[n]Elizabeth said.

[msg MSG_005 [Naoto]]
But is it even possible for us to[n]communicate with them?

[sel SEL_006 top]
They seem to have good vocabulary!
Won't know until we try.

[msg MSG_007 [Ryuji]]
Yeah. They don't look dangerous, so[n]might as well give it a go.

[msg MSG_008 [Yosuke]]
All right, show us how it's done.

[msg MSG_009 [Ryuji]]
Okay. Um... hey, uh, buddy. Bud! Hey,[n]bud, you got a sec? We're lookin' for[n]something.

[msg MSG_010 [Relaxed Flower]]
You're a strange-looking flower.

[msg MSG_011 [Cheerful Flower]]
But look how his pollen shines in the[n]sun!

[msg MSG_012 [Ryuji]]
That's not pollen, it's my hair, ya[n]weirdo. Anyways, we're looking for this[n]thing...

[msg MSG_013 [Relaxed Flower]]
Sing with us, fair blossom!

[msg MSG_014 [Ryuji]]
I am NOT a "fair blossom"!

[msg MSG_015 [Cheerful Flower]]
Praise the golden sun in the heavenly[n]firmament!

[msg MSG_016 [Ryuji]]
There is no sun or heavenly firmament[n]here! WILL YOU LISTEN!?

[msg MSG_017 [Ryuji]]
Sorry guys... But they're delusional...

[msg MSG_018 [Yukiko]]
D-Don't worry about it... hehe... At[n]least you've still got your pollen-y[n]hair.
When you go bald you can just blame the[n]bees for carrying your hair away.
Hahaha! Oh, that's funny... *snort*[n]BWHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

[msg MSG_019 [Ryuji]]
Shut up, it's not THAT funny!

[msg MSG_020 [Chie]]
Oh, don't even try. Once Yukiko's been[n]set off, there's no stopping her[n]giggles.

[msg MSG_021 [Junpei]]
Hey, why don't you let me handle this?
With my powers of persuasion, I'll[n]sweet-talk them into spilling the beans!

[msg MSG_022 [Junpei]]
Why hello there, lovelies!
May I just say that you smell just[n]gorgeous today! Such an odor!

[msg MSG_023 [Relaxed Flower]]
Well, I never! What an incredibly[n]inappropriate thing to say!

[msg MSG_024 [Cheerful Flower]]
Didn't your mother teach you any manners[n]when you were a seed?

[msg MSG_025 [Junpei]]
Huh? Wait, wha?

[msg MSG_026 [Relaxed Flower]]
Back to singing! Ahem... When the rays[n]shine down on me I rejoice...

[msg MSG_027 [Junpei]]
Hey, come on! I just wanna ask about[n]this thing we're looking for...

[msg MSG_028 [Cheerful Flower]]
For time eternal, we all bask in this[n]sun by choice.

[msg MSG_029 [Junpei]]
...

[msg MSG_030 [Junpei]]
Um... They're bein' really cagey...

[msg MSG_031 [Akihiko]]
What happened to your incredible powers[n]of persuasion?

[msg MSG_032 [Junpei]]
Dude, they can't be reasoned with!

[msg MSG_033 [Yosuke]]
Time to switch out! I'll go next!
After all, I really honed my people[n]skills at Junes.

[msg MSG_034 [Teddie]]
Woooo! You go, Yosuke!

[msg MSG_035 [Yosuke]]
Watch and learn!
WELLLLLLLCOME!

[msg MSG_036 [Yosuke]]
Hm, that always worked at Junes...
I don't get it; they just kept singing[n]those words. Which seem to be a metaphor[n]for something...?

[msg MSG_037 [Chie]]
Maybe something in Hikari-chan's mind...[n]But what're we supposed to do now?
We're not getting anywhere at this rate.[n]Anybody have any other bright ideas?

[msg MSG_038 [Yosuke]]
We don't have any other leads...
We don't know anything else about the[n]"black thing"...

[msg MSG_039 [Relaxed Flower]]
Oh, you want to know about the black[n]thing?

[msg MSG_040 [Cheerful Flower]]
Well, well. Why didn't you just say so?

[msg MSG_041 [Yosuke]]
Oh, now they respond!?

[msg MSG_042 [Ryuji]]
Shut up, Yosuke! Hey, buds, what exactly[n]is the "black thing"? Where can we find[n]it?

[msg MSG_043 [Relaxed Flower]]
Hehehehehe. The "black thing" was taken[n]away.

[msg MSG_044 [Cheerful Flower]]
And taken down below.

[msg MSG_045 [Relaxed Flower]]
They wanted it all to themselves.

[msg MSG_046 [Chie]]
Um... I don't really get what they're[n]saying, but basically there might be[n]something down below?

[msg MSG_047 [Ryuji]]
Hikari, does this ring any bells for[n]you?
Or do you, like, sense anything[n]underground?

[msg MSG_048 [Hikari]]
Um... It's only a vague feeling, but I[n]do sense something around here.

[msg MSG_049 [Hikari]]
I can't explain it...

[msg MSG_050 [Akechi]]
You don't have to. This whole movie is[n]based on your mind, Hikari-san.
We should investigate whatever feeling[n]you get, no matter how vague.

[msg MSG_051 [Yosuke]]
Sit tight, Hikari-chan. We'll find[n]whatever it is you're looking for.

[msg MSG_052 [Hikari]]
Thank you so much... It's such a relief[n]to have everyone's help.

[msg MSG_053 [Junpei]]
So we gotta be sure to mention "black[n]thing" wherever we go!
After all, other flowers might know more[n]about it. Let's try searching on the[n]floor below this one!
