[msg MSG_000 [Elizabeth]]
Ah... And now, all that remains is[n]disappointment.
Not because I have been bested, but[n]because our performance has drawn to a[n]close.

[sel SEL_001 top]
You were strong.
That wasn't too hard.

[msg MSG_002 [Elizabeth]]
No... While I have some knowledge of[n]this rough play, I am still quite[n]inexperienced.

[msg MSG_003 [Elizabeth]]
*chuckle* Truly, your strength never[n]ceases to amaze me.

[msg MSG_004 [Margaret]]
That was a wonderful fight. I felt a[n]fire blaze in my heart from spectation[n]alone.

[msg MSG_005 [Elizabeth]]
Sister? I didn't know you were here.

[msg MSG_006 [Margaret]]
Yes. I had hoped to see this battle.
Not only did I aim to witness the power[n]they've nurtured here...

[msg MSG_006_1 [Margaret]]
I wished to see what possibilities lie[n]beyond their magnificent display.

[msg MSG_007 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Oh right, that film...

[msg MSG_008]
The film that looked sooty is now[n]glowing faintly...
......!
The four pieces of film are shining[n]powerfully bright together...!

[msg MSG_009 [P4 Hero]]
Is it...?

[msg MSG_010 [P4 Hero]]
Ngh...!

[msg MSG_011]
A brilliant light floods the area...

[msg MSG_012 [P4 Hero]]
That light just now...

[msg MSG_013 [P3 Hero]]
It's like... something's changed within[n]me.

[msg MSG_014 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Is this my...?

[msg MSG_015]
I sense a new power within my heart...

[msg MSG_016 [Margaret]]
*chuckle* It seems you've all grasped a[n]new possibility.

[msg MSG_017 [Elizabeth]]
It has been a joy and a privilege to[n]witness such a rare sight.
If I might ask... How do you feel?

[sel SEL_018 top]
It's... incredible.
It's hard to tell.

[msg MSG_019 [Margaret]]
Yes, truly.
I cannot wait to see what you can[n]accomplish from here on.

[msg MSG_020 [Margaret]]
Hmhm... I suppose that's fine for now.

[msg MSG_020_1 [Margaret]]
But that power will surely help you[n]choose your own paths to come.

[msg MSG_021 [Elizabeth]]
Either way... it is staggering indeed to[n]know you've bested all those who govern[n]power. Myself included!

[msg MSG_022 [Margaret]]
Ha... I'm certain this will be a great[n]surprise indeed to our master.

[msg MSG_022_1 [Margaret]]
You've done well in coming so far.[n]Though perhaps all this was simply your[n]fate...?

[msg MSG_023 [Akechi]]
I'd say it's thanks to us keeping up[n]with those special screenings.

[msg MSG_023_1 [Akechi]]
After all, that was where this all[n]began.

[msg MSG_024 [Junpei]]
Yeah, we'd have gotten nowhere without[n]those! Makes you wonder who was pullin'[n]the strings.

[msg MSG_025 [Hikari]]
......

[msg MSG_025_1 [Hikari]]
Um... Well, I don't know if anyone set[n]it up deliberately... but I've been[n]thinking about it.
I wonder if it's more like... the[n]special screenings happen based on your[n]emotions? Or... wishes, I guess?

[msg MSG_026 [Naoto]]
I see. An interesting hypothesis...
Our memories did seem to alter the[n]characters in those movies we've been[n]investigating.
More importantly, Hikari-san's movie[n]seemed deeply reflective of her own[n]mindset and perspective.

[msg MSG_027 [Akechi]]
So, similarly, the special screenings[n]reflect our own consciousness...?

[msg MSG_028 [Hikari]]
Right. Like wanting to get closer to[n]everyone, or maybe wanting to get[n]stronger...
If you wished for all those things hard[n]enough, then maybe they became movies?

[msg MSG_029 [P4 Hero]]
That may be true. It would explain why[n]we learned that Unison Skill...

[msg MSG_030 [Teddie]]
Tons of my wishes came true, too!

[msg MSG_031 [Yukiko]]
I wanted to get to know everybody[n]better, and that came true. Now we're[n]all friends, aren't we?

[msg MSG_032 [P3 Fem Protag]]
If I've learned anything, it's that you[n]can make any wish come true if you hold[n]onto it with all your heart.

[msg MSG_033 [Junpei]]
You're telling me our thoughts can turn[n]into movies...? Gah, I can't take it[n]anymore!

[msg MSG_033_1 [Junpei]]
I want a movie where I'm the star! With[n]hot babes, and a car chase, and[n]explosions!

[msg MSG_034 [Yukari]]
*sigh* We get enough of your delusions[n]already. I don't need a personal ticket[n]to them.

[msg MSG_035 [Elizabeth]]
In any case, it is clear you have all[n]grown tremendously in this world of[n]movies.
I believe freedom is already within your[n]grasp. Keep striving, and I am sure you[n]will succeed.

[sel SEL_036 top]
Thanks.
I hope you'll help us.

[msg MSG_037 [Elizabeth]]
Oh, you need not thank me. You have come[n]this far almost entirely under your own[n]power.

[msg MSG_038 [Elizabeth]]
I understand. I will do everything in my[n]power to assist you.

[msg MSG_039 [Elizabeth]]
I apologize for not mentioning it until[n]now, but I also have a reward for you.[n]Please use it well.
Now, I shall be on my way. Let us meet[n]again at the box office.

[msg PERSONA_STOCK_UP_MSG]
Overcoming this ordeal has strengthened[n]the power of the wild card. Your Persona[n]stock has increased by .

The effect of [f 4 4 3 0 1596] has[n]increased the EXP boost of Finish[n]Bonuses.
