Now then, allow me to watch over this[n]battle as well.
I rarely get to witness my sister's full[n]power... The very thought gives me[n]chills.

[msg MSG_001 [Margaret]]
*chuckle* Hopefully we'll have the[n]chance for a bout ourselves, one day.

[msg MSG_002 [Futaba]]
Oh man, they'd tear this place up...

[msg MSG_002_1 [Futaba]]
But forget thatâ€•you guys better be[n]careful. She's gonna give you a hell of[n]a fight!

Ever since I first arrived here... I've[n]been watching you all very closely.
Even at the mercies of fate, engulfed in[n]despair, you still shine bright... It[n]has been most fascinating.
And somewhere in my heart, I confess I[n]have been waiting for an excuse to test[n]you myself.

[msg MSG_003_2 [Margaret]]
So... let us begin. Let me see your[n]souls ablaze with light!

[msg MSG_004 [Margaret]]
*chuckle* I hope you give me a little[n]longer to enjoy it this time. I'm[n]certain you can give me a challenge.
