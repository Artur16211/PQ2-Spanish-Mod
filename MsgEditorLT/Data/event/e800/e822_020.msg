[msg MSG_000 [Futaba]]
Our targets are the three Guardian[n]Machines. Be careful now.

[msg MSG_001 [Morgana]]
Come on, Ken, try to keep up!

[msg MSG_002 [Ken]]
Um, so phantom thieves are all about[n]sticking to the shadows and quietly[n]taking out their enemies, right?

[sel SEL_003 top]
Stealth's the way to go.
All the time.
Too bad we can't do that here...

[msg MSG_004 [Ken]]
So it's true...
Do you guys leap over walls and sneak[n]past security lasers too?

[msg MSG_005 [Ann]]
Yeah, we've done that a couple times...

[msg MSG_006 [Ann]]
Yeah. That'd definitely make things[n]easier...

[msg MSG_007 [Ryuji]]
No kiddin'. We'd already be done with[n]the screening if it were business as[n]usual.
Think about all those walls we had to[n]hop and security lasers we had to slip[n]past.

[msg MSG_008 [Ken]]
S-So it's true...

[msg MSG_009 [Morgana]]
You seem pretty familiar with this[n]stuff, Ken.

[msg MSG_010 [Ken]]
Huh? Uh, well... I've learned a lot from[n]books and movies.

[msg MSG_011 [Morgana]]
That's great. You might even have more[n]potential than Skull.

[msg MSG_012 [Ryuji]]
Say what!?

[msg MSG_013 [Ann]]
Okay, okay, save it for the Shadows. We[n]should get going.

[sel SEL_014 top]
Commencing mission.
Let's get started.
Follow our lead.

[msg MSG_015 [Ken]]
Yeah!
