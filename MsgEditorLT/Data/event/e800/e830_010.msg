The objective of this special[n]screening...
Is to clear the specified floor of[n]A.I.G.I.S.

[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
That's it? We already know that floor[n]pretty well. Won't this be easy?

[msg MSG_002 [Elizabeth]]
But one must remember that you cannot[n]judge a book by its coveralls. Things[n]are not always as they seem.
As such, the layout of the floor has[n]become terribly complex.
Your task is to navigate the[n]labyrinthine passages and return safely.

[sel SEL_003 top]
What happened?
Who's responsible for this?

[msg MSG_004 [Elizabeth]]
Well... I'm afraid I don't have further[n]details on the matter.

[msg MSG_005 [Fuuka]]
When you say the layout's become[n]complex... How exactly did it change?

[msg MSG_006 [Elizabeth]]
Well... If I were to give a more visual[n]example, it now resembles Junpei's room.

[msg MSG_007 [Yukari]]
Ugh, that's already more than I wanted[n]to know.

[msg MSG_008 [Mitsuru]]
Ngh... You mean to say we have to[n]navigate such a nightmare?

[msg MSG_009 [Junpei]]
Um, guys? Words can hurt too, y'know.

[msg MSG_010 [Makoto]]
There's no point discussing it here.[n]Let's go in and see for ourselves.

[sel SEL_011 top]
Agreed.
We're gonna get lost...

[msg MSG_012 [Haru]]
Right. We have a splendid map, and[n]helpful navigators besides!

[msg MSG_013 [Futaba]]
Don't worry. You already got a map, and[n]we'll be navigating for you.

[msg MSG_014 [Rise]]
Yeah, we'll be here to support you. Make[n]sure to come straight back if it gets[n]too rough out there.

[msg MSG_015 [Morgana]]
All right! Then it's settled.
It might be a long trek, and we might[n]get lost. Make sure we're prepared.
