You've defeated the almighty[n]Tyranniqueen! Good work, warriors!

[msg MSG_001 [Kanji]]
Heh! Take that, shitbag! I don't wanna[n]see your ugly face here ever again!

[msg MSG_002 [Ken]]
You can't say it like that, Kanji-san.[n]Heroes don't curse like that.
Try to have some finesse.

[msg MSG_003 [Kanji]]
O-Oh, yeah? All right then...
Y-Yeah! How do you like that!? We are[n]the Phoenix Rangers!

[msg MSG_004 [Ken]]
Yeah, that's it! Okay, my turn!
Villains don't stand a chance as long as[n]the Phoenix Rangers are around![n]Featherman forever!

[sel SEL_005 top]
Nice.
That was cool.

[msg MSG_006 [Ken]]
Thanks! We did it by working together.

[msg MSG_007 [Ken]]
Heheh, pretty heroic, right? This is a[n]dream come true.

[msg MSG_008 [Futaba]]
The great tyrant was vanquished, and[n]thus, peace was restored in Junessic[n]Land.
Next time on Phoenix Ranger Featherman,[n]the heroes return to base!

[msg MSG_009 [Morgana]]
I'm not sure what's going on, but it[n]looks like we're all done here. Let's[n]head back.
