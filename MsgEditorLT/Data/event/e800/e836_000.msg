Rise-chan, Futaba-chan... Could I have a[n]moment?

[msg MSG_001 [Rise]]
What's wrong?

[msg MSG_002 [Fuuka]]
Um... We've got a lot of fighting ahead[n]of us in this world, so...
I think it's safe to say we'll have some[n]big battles ahead, right?

[msg MSG_003 [Futaba]]
For sure. I'm getting a bunch of "final[n]boss coming up" vibes.

[msg MSG_004 [Fuuka]]
So... I was thinking everyone's going to[n]need our support more than ever.

[msg MSG_005 [Rise]]
Okay, so you want to upgrade our[n]navigation power somehow?

[msg MSG_006 [Fuuka]]
Yeah. I want to see if there's something[n]we can do to build up our power into[n]something more.

[msg MSG_007 [Futaba]]
Whoa, like training in a hyperbaric time[n]chamber! I could get into that!
Oh, but just FYI, I'm not sitting under[n]any waterfalls. Whatever we do, it[n]better not be manual labor.

[msg MSG_008 [Rise]]
Most of our navigation is through our[n]Personas. I guess we can't just get[n]better that easily...

[msg MSG_009 [Futaba]]
Yeah, it's not like we can just hook[n]some dragon up with a ball collection in[n]exchange for more power...
...But maybe there's some sort of[n]power-up we could use. Or some cheats?

[msg MSG_010 [Fuuka]]
Oh, you know... This was before I joined[n]the Specialized Extracurricular[n]Execution Squad...
Mitsuru-senpai performed navigator[n]duties using a machine that helped[n]amplify her searching abilities.

[msg MSG_011 [Futaba]]
It helped her search better? So it was[n]like a personal radar?

[msg MSG_012 [Fuuka]]
Yes. It was some kind of machine, but it[n]helped refine her powers.
Obviously we can't use Mitsuru-senpai's,[n]but if we could design a similar comms[n]system...

[msg MSG_013 [Rise]]
Oh! That's a good idea! Sometimes it[n]seems like we really have trouble[n]contacting them.
Wouldn't it be great if we had some[n]communication machine that told us what[n]everyone was doing?

[msg MSG_014 [Fuuka]]
I agree. And I think I can make one, if[n]we can find the right parts.

[msg MSG_015 [Futaba]]
If you need parts, then Ribbon's movie[n]might be a good place to look.
There's a ton of Shadows and FOEs in[n]there that would probably drop stuff we[n]can use.

[msg MSG_016 [Rise]]
I dunno for sure if it'll work, but it's[n]definitely worth a shot!
Why don't we get started now? You guys[n]wait here!

[msg MSG_017 [Futaba]]
H-Hey! Where are you going?

[msg MSG_018 [Rise]]
I'm baaack!

[msg MSG_019 [Fuuka]]
Rise-chan, is that...?

[msg MSG_020 [Rise]]
I told Elizabeth our story, and had her[n]make a ticket.
We put out a request! "Please gather[n]some machinery"!

[msg MSG_021 [Futaba]]
Whoa! GJ Rise!
Looking for those parts on our own would[n]have been like playing on Risky Mode!

[msg MSG_022 [Rise]]
Well, keep in mind that they might not[n]even pick it up, but we can be patient,[n]right?

[msg MSG_023 [Fuuka]]
Definitely. Still, I hope they accept[n]our request soon!

[msg MSG_024]
A new special screening: "Social[n]Network" has been added to the box[n]office.
