Daaang... What's with all the FOEs...?

[msg MSG_001 [Ken]]
This must have been what Koromaru was[n]telling us about.

[msg MSG_002 [Kanji]]
So this wasn't the right way? Do we head[n]back?

[msg MSG_003 [Akechi]]
Hold on... All these FOEs are here for[n]security.
They don't want anyone getting close...[n]Which can only mean...

[sel SEL_004 top]
They're guards.
They're protecting something?
They're keeping people away.

[msg MSG_005 [Akechi]]
Right. If security is this tight, then[n]they must be guarding something.

[msg MSG_006 [Morgana]]
You mean they're security for the[n]nightclub? The nightclub's using FOEs!?

[msg MSG_007 [Akechi]]
Well, it would make sense. It is VIP,[n]after all.

[msg MSG_008 [Kanji]]
Then the club's gotta be just past here.

[msg MSG_009 [Junpei]]
Hell yeah! Adult paradise awaits! FOEs,[n]clear the way!

[msg MSG_010 [Teddie]]
Here we gooo!

[msg MSG_011 [Yukari]]
What a bunch of children... Why can't[n]they always be that motivated?

[msg MSG_012 [Ann]]
Using FOEs for security... That's[n]definitely not normal.

[msg MSG_013 [Mitsuru]]
*sigh* Either way, we'll want to be on[n]our guard.
And let's not forget, we said we'd leave[n]it to them. Let's see what they can do.
