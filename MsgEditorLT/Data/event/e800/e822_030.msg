How you holdin' up, Ken? Not runnin'[n]outta steam, are ya?

[msg MSG_001 [Ken]]
*chuckle* Don't underestimate me just[n]because I'm still in grade school.
I've honed my skills in Tartarus, you[n]know.

[sel SEL_002 top]
Ah, that's right.
Tartarus?
It's got nothing on the Palaces.

[msg MSG_003 [Ken]]
Yeah. I've fought tons of Shadows there.

[msg MSG_004 [Morgana]]
Sounds a lot like Mementos and the[n]Palaces.

[msg MSG_005 [Ken]]
It's where we usually fight Shadows.

[msg MSG_006 [Morgana]]
Sounds a lot like Mementos and the[n]Palaces.

[msg MSG_007 [Morgana]]
Hey, we've never seen Tartarus before,[n]so we can't say that for sure.
But if it's a nest for Shadows, it's[n]probably pretty similar.

[msg MSG_008 [Ken]]
Palaces... Is that where you do most of[n]your phantom thief stuff?

[msg MSG_009 [Morgana]]
Yeah. Warped desires can cause someone[n]to form a Palace in their heart.
The core of those desires rests deep[n]within that Palace... And that's the[n]Treasure we're after.

[msg MSG_010 [Ken]]
So that's why you're called the Phantom[n]Thieves that steals hearts...
It's all so unbelievable.

[sel SEL_011 top]
The feeling's mutual.
You still don't believe us?
The same goes for SEES.

[msg MSG_012 [Ryuji]]
You said it. What about all that crap[n]with the Tartarus and the Dark Hour?
That sounds way more farfetched, man.

[msg MSG_013 [Ken]]
Well, as a member of SEES, I'm pretty[n]used to hearing crazy stories...
But all this stuff about phantom thieves[n]is just...

[msg MSG_014 [Futaba]]
I get you. It does sound like something[n]straight out of a comic book.

[msg MSG_015 [Ryuji]]
I know, right? You're an extracurricular[n]squad of students who fight Shadows[n]during an hour nobody knows about...
That sounds way crazier than anything on[n]our end.

[msg MSG_016 [Morgana]]
Hey, we've still got a lot of work to[n]do. We'd better keep moving.

[msg MSG_017 [Ann]]
Yeah, you're right. Let's stay focused[n]for these last two!
