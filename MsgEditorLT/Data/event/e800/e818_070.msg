[msg MSG_000 [Elizabeth]]
I am glad you were able to gather the[n]materials safely.
Now to hand them over to Theo.

[msg MSG_001 [Theodore]]
Thank you.
Ah, these are indeed the materials I'd[n]hoped for... They'll likely allow me to[n]craft you new equipment.
I'll do my very best. If all of you[n]would please wait here.

[msg MSG_002 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hooray! Now we'll have even more to[n]choose from.

[sel SEL_003 top]
We'll be even more powerful.
I bet it'll cost us...

[msg MSG_004 [Futaba]]
Yeah, but be sure you actually equip the[n]stuff or else there's no point in buying[n]it.

[msg MSG_005 [Theodore]]
Ah, I nearly forgot.
It will cost money, yes. That said, this[n]is from me to you.
Please accept this, [f 6 1 27 0 0 0].

[msg MSG_006 [P3 Fem Protag]]
A ring? For me?

[sel SEL_007 top]
He's proposing.
Congratulations.
I want one too.

[msg MSG_008 [Chie]]
Wh-What!?

[msg MSG_009 [Yukiko]]
But if a man gives a woman a ring...[n]That's almost like saying...

[msg MSG_010 [Haru]]
Wait a minute. We have to hear-chan's[n]response.
What's your answer? Are you going to say[n]yes, or...

[msg MSG_011 [Theodore]]
I apologize. I had only those materials[n]to work with...

[msg MSG_012 [Ryuji]]
Materials?

[msg MSG_013 [Theodore]]
Uh, I feel as though you've[n]misunderstood...
This is a present from Yukari, Fuuka,[n]and Junpei.

[msg MSG_014 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Whaâ€•!? It's from you guys?

[msg MSG_015 [Theodore]]
They brought it to my attention in[n]advance and asked if I would make[n]something from what was left over.

[msg MSG_016 [Yukari]]
It's really just pieces of the materials[n]we found, so it's not much, but...

[msg MSG_017 [Fuuka]]
They were so pretty, we thought we'd[n]turn them into an accessory.

[msg MSG_018 [P3 Fem Protag]]
But why me? I didn't do anything to[n]receive a gift...

[sel SEL_019 top]
It's to say thanks for all you do.
It's a token of our appreciation.
We're friends, aren't we?

[msg MSG_020 [Yukari]]
There you have it.
You said you were just trying to do your[n]part for the team.
So we figured we'd try to do our part[n]and show that we value your friendship.

[msg MSG_021 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Friendship...

[msg MSG_022 [Fuuka]]
It's true we didn't know you before we[n]were brought here.
But we enjoy being with you,, and we[n]want to get to know you better.

[msg MSG_023 [Junpei]]
We were hoping this ring would help us[n]show that.
It is made of Shadows, though...

[msg MSG_024 [Yukari]]
Can it, Junpei! It's pretty, so who[n]cares!?

[msg MSG_025 [P3 Fem Protag]]
......

[msg MSG_026 [Fuuka]]
-chan...?

[msg MSG_027 [P3 Fem Protag]]
...Thank you. You've all made me very[n]happy.
It's really beautiful, even if it is[n]made from Shadows.

[msg MSG_028 [Yukari]]
Let's stop saying that, all right?

[msg MSG_029 [Makoto]]
-san does look happy.

[msg MSG_030 [Mitsuru]]
Yes. It certainly wasn't our intention[n]to make her feel lonely.
Although, judging from her expression,[n]it looks like we won't have to worry[n]about that anymore...

[msg MSG_031 [Elizabeth]]
You did a good deed, Theo.
It seems your guest has formed new[n]bonds.

[msg MSG_032 [Theodore]]
Not at all. I simply lent a hand...
The rest they did on their own.

[msg MSG_033 [Elizabeth]]
*chuckle* I suppose you are right.
