Welcome one and all. The goal of this[n]special screening is...

[msg MSG_001 [Marie]]
Find singing flowers.

[msg MSG_002 [Chie]]
Hey, why are you chiming in, Marie-[n]chan?

[msg MSG_003 [Margaret]]
Marie has a keen interest in this movie.

[msg MSG_004 [Yosuke]]
Whoa! The older sister is here too!

[msg MSG_005 [Kanji]]
Singin' flowers... You mean those things[n]that were in Hikari's movie, right?
I dunno if that counts as singin',[n]really... Why the sudden interest,[n]anyhow?

[sel SEL_006 top]
The whole request seems odd.
Has Marie been inspired?

[msg MSG_007 [Marie]]
...

[msg MSG_008 [Marie]]
...!

[msg MSG_009 [Margaret]]
It seems she's been intrigued by[n]Hikari's movie ever since she saw those[n]flowers.
Recently, she's been in a poetic slump,[n]and so craves stimulation.

[msg MSG_010 [Marie]]
What!? Don't tell them that! Also, what[n]I write isn't poetry!
It's just... there's nothing here, so it[n]gets boring. How am I supposed to feel[n]any pathos in a place like this?

[msg MSG_011 [Margaret]]
There you have it. Would you mind taking[n]Marie along with you for this screening?

[sel SEL_012 top]
Fine by me.
Take her along?
Isn't that dangerous?

[msg MSG_013 [Margaret]]
Wonderful. I trust she will be quite[n]safe in your care.

[msg MSG_014 [Margaret]]
Yes, she'll certainly feel more of this[n]"pathos" if she goes in person, no?

[msg MSG_015 [Margaret]]
I have already seen how capable you are.[n]I hold no worries of her safety if she[n]is with you.

[msg MSG_016 [Marie]]
I-It's nothing important... You don't[n]have to do it if you don't want to...

[msg MSG_017 [Teddie]]
Why wouldn't we want to!? Field trip[n]with Emmy-chan! Woohoo!

[msg MSG_018 [P4 Hero]]
What Teddie means to say is, we don't[n]mind helping you.

[msg MSG_019 [Marie]]
Really? Um, well... Thanks.

[msg MSG_020 [Elizabeth]]
Well then, good luck out there to[n]everyone, Marie included.
