Treasure, treasure[f 0 1 1]!

[msg MSG_001 [Koromaru]]
Woof! Woof!

[msg MSG_002 [Ann]]
It really is a treasure trove! Good[n]thing we came this way.

[msg MSG_003 [Morgana]]
See? This wouldn't have happened if we'd[n]taken the short path.

[msg MSG_004 [Teddie]]
Ngh...
B-But the only reason we found the[n]treasure was because of my nose!
I'm not just some cat who starts[n]drooling at the first sign of treasure!

[msg MSG_005 [Morgana]]
I wasn't drooling! You better shut it,[n]you... You...

[sel SEL_006 top]
Quit fighting.
You all did well.
Say something, Panther.

[msg MSG_007 [Ann]]
Yeah. We're here because we worked[n]together.
Besides, there's no time to argue. We[n]haven't even found the grand prize yet!

[msg MSG_008 [Ann]]
That's right. We're here because we[n]worked together.
Let's keep it up and go for the grand[n]prize too!

[msg MSG_009 [Ann]]
Me...?
Uh... good job, you guys! We couldn't[n]have made it this far without you.

[msg MSG_010 [Morgana]]
Well, if you say so, Lady Ann...

[msg MSG_011 [Teddie]]
Hear, hear. I, too, cannot bring myself[n]to trouble such a lovely lady.

[msg MSG_012 [Yosuke]]
Okay, on to the grand prize.

[msg MSG_013 [Yukari]]
Any idea of what that might be?
None of what we've found so far has been[n]particularly beautiful or alluring.

[msg MSG_014 [Junpei]]
It's gonna be something a girl would[n]like, right? I'll bet it's...

[sel SEL_015 top]
Clothes.
Sweets.
Money.

[msg MSG_016 [Junpei]]
Yeah. Something really fancy with frills[n]or ribbons or whatever. Girls love that.

[msg MSG_017 [Yukari]]
Uh, I think you mean YOU love that.
Also, why would he go through the[n]trouble of hiding something like that[n]out in the jungle?

[msg MSG_018 [Ann]]
Well, I do like sweets, but...

[msg MSG_019 [Yosuke]]
Nah, who hides something like that in[n]the jungle?

[msg MSG_020 [Yukari]]
Well, I guess it is better to let her[n]buy something she likes rather than give[n]her something without much thought...

[msg MSG_021 [Junpei]]
Yeah, real romantic...

[msg MSG_022 [Teddie]]
No, no, that won't do.
The one that thing that would make a[n]girl happiest is obviously a passionate[n]kiss on the―

[msg MSG_023 [Koromaru]]
Bark, bark!

[msg MSG_024 [Teddie]]
Wha―!?

[msg MSG_025 [Aigis]]
He said if you do that again, you will[n]be escorted off the premises.

[msg MSG_026 [Rise]]
It's just like a meet and greet...

[msg MSG_027 [Morgana]]
Good one, Koromaru.
Let's ditch this dummy, and find that[n]treasure.
We're almost there!

[msg MSG_028 [Koromaru]]
Arf!
