The goal of this special screening is[n]to...
"Gather the ingredients!" It must be one[n]of those so-called gourmet films.

[msg MSG_001 [Yusuke]]
Yes...!

[msg MSG_002 [Elizabeth]]
This one will be set in "Junessic Land."
Ah, so you're finally giving in to your[n]carnal desire to feast upon one of those[n]dinosaurs? By all means, please do.

[msg MSG_003 [Ryuji]]
Hell no! We ain't doin' that, no matter[n]how hungry we are!

[msg MSG_004 [Akihiko]]
Hmph. I couldn't've asked for a better[n]screening.
Shinji, you better keep your promise.[n]Once we get those ingredients, I want[n]you to make us the best dish you can.

[msg MSG_005 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Huh? We'll get to eat Shinjiro-senpai's[n]cooking!? Hooray! That means we HAVE to[n]do our very best!

[msg MSG_006 [Morgana]]
Oho, Shinjiro's cooking, huh? Can't say[n]I'm not intrigued.

[msg MSG_007 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_008 [Shinjiro]]
The hell... I don't remember promisin'[n]anything...

[msg MSG_009 [Yusuke]]
All right, let's go!
We must hurry, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]! I can hear[n]nature's bounty calling my name!
