The stage for this next special[n]screening will be A.I.G.I.S.
The lead role will be played by a lone,[n]broken robot. It seems it has lost a[n]certain component...
Your task is to locate said component[n]and return the robot to normal in a[n]touching finale...

[msg MSG_001 [P3 Fem Protag]]
A broken robot, huh...? I hope we can[n]fix it soon.

[msg MSG_002 [Koromaru]]
Arf, arf!

[msg MSG_003 [Aigis]]
Koromaru-san says he would like to go[n]with [f 6 1 27 0 0 0]-san.

[msg MSG_004 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Huh? Me?

[msg MSG_005 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_006 [Ken]]
Koromaru did say he was interested in[n]you, [f 6 1 27 0 0 0]-san.
I'm sure that's one reason why he wants[n]to come along.

[msg MSG_007 [P3 Fem Protag]]
*giggle* I guess I'm sort of happy to[n]hear that.
All right, let's go, Koromaru! Oh,[n]you're welcome to join us, Ken-kun.

[msg MSG_008 [Ken]]
Huh!? Uh... Sure!

[msg MSG_009 [Aigis]]
I will go too. Please allow me to[n]accompany you as well.

[msg MSG_010 [Elizabeth]]
I believe finding the robot will prove[n]rather easy... The difficult part will[n]be locating its missing component.
I'm looking forward to a most[n]satisfactory conclusion. Good luck to[n]you all.
