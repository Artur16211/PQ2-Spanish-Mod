[msg MSG_000 [P3 Fem Protag]]
This is the place.

[msg MSG_001 [Akihiko]]
This is a crime scene...? I don't see[n]anything unusual around here.

[msg MSG_002 [Makoto]]
Maybe they finished their investigation[n]and cleaned up already...

[msg MSG_003 [Junpei]]
Seriously!? We didn't find a single[n]clue...

[msg MSG_003_1 [Junpei]]
*sigh* Welp, there goes my motivation.

[msg MSG_004 [Yukari]]
You're giving up way too fast.

[msg MSG_005 [Ann]]
Hey, is it just me, or are there a lot[n]of people here?

[sel SEL_006 top]
There's something to see.
It's a crime scene.
We've become famous...

[msg MSG_007 [Ann]]
Yeah, I guess a crime scene would draw[n]people's attention.

[msg MSG_008 [Yukari]]
Uh, I'm pretty sure they're not here to[n]see us.

[msg MSG_009 [Ann]]
Oh, I get it. They probably want to see[n]the crime scene.

[msg MSG_010 [Makoto]]
Someone here might know what happened.

[msg MSG_011 [Mitsuru]]
Let's ask around, then.

[msg MSG_012 [Makoto]]
Okay, Skull, you and the boys head over[n]that way. Panther, you take the girls[n]over there.

[msg MSG_012_1 [Makoto]]
We'll split up and see what we can[n]learn.

[msg MSG_013 [Ryuji]]
Got it!

[msg MSG_014 [Ann]]
Leave it to me!

[msg MSG_015 [Mitsuru]]
......

[msg MSG_016 [Ken]]
Mitsuru-san?

[msg MSG_017 [Mitsuru]]
Oh, forgive me. Yes, we should ask[n]around as well.

[msg MSG_018 [Ryuji]]
We're all finished up on our end.

[msg MSG_019 [Yusuke]]
It seems a theft occurred here; someone[n]had their wallet stolen.

[msg MSG_020 [Ann]]
It sounds like there were multiple perps[n]too. They surrounded the victim and[n]charged in all at once.

[msg MSG_020_1 [Ann]]
The victim didn't even have time to[n]react.

[msg MSG_021 [Yukari]]
We heard pretty much the same story.

[msg MSG_022 [Akihiko]]
Ganging up on someone like that...[n]That's real low! They won't get away[n]with this!

[msg MSG_023 [Junpei]]
But we didn't get any clues to where the[n]culprits are or what they look like...[n]So, now what?

[sel SEL_024 top]
It's too early to give up.
Let's check another crime scene.

[msg MSG_025 [Makoto]]
Yes. Elizabeth marked some other[n]locations for us.

[msg MSG_025_1 [Makoto]]
We may learn something that will serve[n]as a clue.

[msg MSG_026 [Morgana]]
Okay then, let's head over to another[n]crime scene.
