[msg MSG_000 [Elizabeth]]
Welcome back, everyone.
It was quite a spectacle to watch you[n]overcome that new security system.

[msg MSG_001 [Yukari]]
I don't think the security was the hard[n]part; it was sitting through those[n]stories...

[msg MSG_002 [Elizabeth]]
Yes, the double feature from Junpei and[n]Yukiko was rather fascinating as well.
Perhaps, one day, I'll get the chance to[n]host an "Elizabeth's Believe it, or[n]Don't"... Heh heh heh...

[msg MSG_003 [Junpei]]
Oh? If you're that interested, I'd be[n]happy to show you the ropes.

[msg MSG_004 [Yukiko]]
Me too. I'd like to become a better host[n]for "Yukiko's Believe It, or Don't."
My next story will be titled: "The Giant[n]Sea Cucumber in the Cursed Theater"...[n]How does that sound?

[sel SEL_005 top]
Sounds like fun.
Why a sea cucumber?

[msg MSG_006 [Yukiko]]
I know, right? And then the sea cucumber[n]fires a laser beam and enters its third[n]evolution.

[msg MSG_007 [Junpei]]
Hmm, that's Yukiko-chan for youâ€•[n]creative beyond comprehension.

[msg MSG_008 [Yukiko]]
Huh? Is there something wrong with sea[n]cucumbers?

[msg MSG_009 [Junpei]]
Well, no, but it feels kinda...[n]low-budget? It's interesting for the[n]wrong reasons.

[msg MSG_010 [Makoto]]
Honestly... Don't you think that's[n]enough ghost stories?

[msg MSG_011 [Yukiko]]
It's okay, they're funny ghost stories.

[msg MSG_012 [Junpei]]
Since when was "Junpei's Believe It, or[n]Don't" funny!?
...Well, whatever.
Yukki and I will just have to keep the[n]stories comin' and keep everyone[n]engaged! You can count on us!

[msg MSG_013 [Yukiko]]
Absolutely!

[msg MSG_014 [Yukari]]
Please, no more! Really, we're good!
