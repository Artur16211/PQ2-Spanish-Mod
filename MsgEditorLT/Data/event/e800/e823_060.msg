[msg MSG_000 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hooray! That's the last of them!

[msg MSG_001 [Akihiko]]
Yeah, I guess so.
...So? Who won? I feel like I had better[n]accuracy.

[msg MSG_002 [Shinjiro]]
Hah, the hell are you talking about? We[n]were basically the same.

[msg MSG_003 [Akihiko]]
No way. I got slammed, and you didn't[n]even back me up! That's minus another[n]point!

[msg MSG_004 [Shinjiro]]
That was nothin'! Rub some dirt in it!

[msg MSG_005 [Akihiko]]
What!? Man, you never show me any[n]respect!
And you never make me food! Would it[n]kill you to be a little nicer to me?

[msg MSG_006 [Shinjiro]]
I could say the same to you, Akiâ€•

[msg MSG_007 [Mitsuru]]
Cut it out! Both of you!
How can either of you possibly hope to[n]set a good example with the way you're[n]behaving!?

[msg MSG_008 [Mitsuru]]
We're not here for fun! We're putting[n]our lives on the line!
All this talk of winning and losing...[n]Pathetic... You've lost sight of what's[n]important.

[msg MSG_009 [Akihiko]]
...Well, uh...

[msg MSG_010 [Mitsuru]]
Didn't you listen to what said? No going[n]at it alone.
She made that rule because you two only[n]see what's in front of you.
Granted, neither of you could follow[n]that rule, I'd say you're both[n]disqualified.

[msg MSG_011 [Shinjiro]]
......

[msg MSG_012 [Akihiko]]
......

[msg MSG_013 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hmm... I say... the winner is...

[sel SEL_014 top]
Sanada-san.
Aragaki-san.
Mitsuru.
Me.

[msg MSG_015 [P3 Fem Protag]]
True, Akihiko-senpai really gave it his[n]all, but...

[msg MSG_016 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I do think that Shinjiro-senpai showed[n]some amazing strength, but...

[msg MSG_017 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Oh, you think so too, Joker?

[msg MSG_018 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Yeah, I think you did really well too,[n]Joker. But...

[msg MSG_019 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I say the winner is, Mitsuru-senpai!

[msg MSG_020 [Mitsuru]]
Me?

[msg MSG_021 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Yes, all of you fought very hard and[n]held your own.
But you were also asked to support your[n]teammates.
Mitsuru-senpai wins because she was able[n]to scold her companions for not being[n]there for each other!

[msg MSG_022 [Shinjiro]]
...Can't argue with that.
I feel like an idiot, but Mitsuru and[n]are right. Sorry.

[msg MSG_023 [Akihiko]]
I'm sorry too. I shouldn't've acted that[n]way in front of the underclassmen...

[msg MSG_024 [Mitsuru]]
Hmph, as long as you understand...
...That said, I think the real winner[n]here is [f 6 1 26 0 0 0].

[msg MSG_025 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Huh?

[msg MSG_026 [Mitsuru]]
To be honest, I've never been able to[n]keep these two in line.
You showed me that, much like, you too[n]have what it takes to be a leader.

[msg MSG_027 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Th-Thank you, Mitsuru-senpai!

[msg MSG_028 [Akihiko]]
I agree with Mitsuru.
Both [f 6 1 27 0 0 0] and are incredible people.

[msg MSG_029 [Shinjiro]]
We made real asses out of ourselves...[n]Aki, what do you say we try this again?

[msg MSG_030 [Akihiko]]
Right! Leave it to me! I'll be sure to[n]back you up...
With the best protein I got!

[msg MSG_031 [Shinjiro]]
...I think I'll pass.

[msg MSG_032 [Mitsuru]]
Should I add a rule about no protein[n]next time...?
Either way, we've finished our mission.[n]Let's head back to the theater.
