Looks like we have everything we need!

[msg MSG_001 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Good job, everyone!
Let's head back to the theater and[n]report to Elizabeth.

[msg MSG_002 [Yukari]]
You did a good job too,. Are you doing[n]okay?

[msg MSG_003 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Ahaha, yep. Doing just fine!

[msg MSG_004 [Yukari]]
Oh, I mean like... I know you've had a[n]hard time since you were first brought[n]here...
You've got it harder than everyone else[n]here, but you're also the brightest and[n]most uplifting.

[msg MSG_005 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Well, right now, I have no role as a[n]leader, so it's really all I can do.
I'd have nothing if you took that away.

[sel SEL_006 top]
It's helping a lot.
That's really important.
You're the life of the party.

[msg MSG_007 [Junpei]]
F'sho. If you're feelin' depressed, then[n]the rest of us are gonna feel down too.

[msg MSG_008 [Yukari]]
Mm-hm. Unlike someone else I know, you[n]actually do a good job.

[msg MSG_009 [Fuuka]]
I think keeping the party lively is very[n]important.

[msg MSG_010 [P3 Fem Protag]]
You're going to make me blush...
I'm just trying to do my part for the[n]team...

[msg MSG_011 [Akihiko]]
Hey, [f 6 1 27 0 0 0], you got a sec? Mitsuru's[n]calling for you.

[msg MSG_012 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Be right there.
I'll leave the materials to you guys.

[msg MSG_013 [Junpei]]
Still feels like there's some distance[n]between us...

[msg MSG_014 [Fuuka]]
It sounded like she was being modest[n]earlier too.

[msg MSG_015 [Junpei]]
Isn't there some kinda magic item or[n]somethin' that brings hearts closer[n]together?

[sel SEL_016 top]
Magic item?
How about a present?

[msg MSG_017 [Junpei]]
Uh, that was just an example...

[msg MSG_018 [Yukari]]
Oh, that's it!

[msg MSG_019 [Fuuka]]
What is it, Yukari-chan?

[msg MSG_020 [Yukari]]
It's good to show your teammates you[n]appreciate them every once in a while,[n]right?
Huddle up, guys... I say we... Then[n]we...

[msg MSG_021 [Junpei]]
Uh-huh, okay... You're quite the[n]schemer, Yuka-tan.

[msg MSG_022 [Fuuka]]
*giggle* I can't wait to see her[n]reaction.

[msg MSG_023 [Yukari]]
We should hurry up and give these to[n]Theodore.
C'mon, everyone, let's go.
