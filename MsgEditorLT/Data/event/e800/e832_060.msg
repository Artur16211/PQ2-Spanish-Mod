We have reached our destination. Will[n]this location suffice?

[msg MSG_001 [Haru]]
Yes. It looks like there's a lot of people[n]here, so it should work out okay... This'll[n]definitely take some courage, though.
Oh, do we need permission from the[n]police? Or can we just get started?

[msg MSG_002 [Rise]]
Hmm, I think we'll be all right?[n]Remember, this is for the special[n]screening.

[msg MSG_003 [Teddie]]
Hrm, hrm, hrm... It's finally time for[n]my big debut!
So, how do we draw a crowd?

[msg MSG_004 [Haru]]
Oh, um... We still need to figure that[n]out, don't we?

[msg MSG_005 [Rise]]
Leave that to the one and only Risette![n]I'll support you the whole way!
First, we'll wanna hammer out your[n]opening lines.

[msg MSG_006 [Aigis]]
Opening lines?

[msg MSG_007 [Rise]]
Yeah. Let everyone know who you are and[n]hype them up for the main event!
Then, once the crowd's warmed up, we'll[n]move on to your acts! That oughta really[n]get things moving!
And this way, I can participate too,[n]even though I'm not physically there!

[msg MSG_008 [Teddie]]
I get it now! Okay, I'm ready!

[msg MSG_009 [Rise]]
All right, let's practice! I'll try and[n]lead everyone, so just listen for when I[n]call your name!

[msg MSG_010 [Aigis]]
Understood. I will stand by for your[n]cue.

[msg MSG_011 [Rise]]
Introducing, the beauty brigade! First[n]up is the mysterious masked beauty,[n]Noir!

[msg MSG_012 [Haru]]
Beauty Thief takes the stage! I've come[n]to steal your hearts!

[msg MSG_015 [Rise]]
And moving on, we have this mysterious[n]bear costume! Who could be inside!? Take[n]it away, Teddie!

[msg MSG_016 [Teddie]]
Adorable bear on the outside, but on the[n]inside...

[msg MSG_017 [Teddie]]
Ta-da! Gimme your hearts!

[msg MSG_018 [Rise]]
Yeah, I'm likin' the diversity here. You[n]guys look great!
Now if we can just take this to the main[n]stage and get the people's attention...

[msg MSG_019 [Excited boy]]
Hey, look! Someone popped out of that[n]bear suit!

[msg MSG_020 [Curious girl]]
Hey, Daddy! What's that teddie bear[n]doing?

[msg MSG_021 [Middle-aged garbage man]]
What's goin' on here? That bear costume[n]for some kind of event?

[msg MSG_022 [Teddie]]
Huh? We're already drawing a crowd?

[msg MSG_023 [Haru]]
Looks like you caught their attention,[n]Teddie.

[msg MSG_024 [Rise]]
Sheesh, you stand out too much, Teddie![n]I guess your act really does draw people[n]in.

[msg MSG_025 [Teddie]]
Oho, really now...? In that case, have I[n]got a treat for you!
I give you a present from the beauty[n]brigade! Snacks for everyone!

[msg MSG_026 [Teddie]]
And awaaay they gooo! Wooohooo!

[msg MSG_027 [Curious girl]]
Wow! This is amazing! It's raining[n]snacks!

[msg MSG_028 [Calm man]]
Wow, is there a festival today?

[msg MSG_029 [Happy lady]]
Ahaha, I can't remember the last time I[n]had fun like this!

[msg MSG_030 [Rise]]
Wow, a ton of people are showing up!
Those snacks just keep coming... Teddie,[n]how much do you have in there!?

[msg MSG_031 [Haru]]
*giggle* They all look so happy.
Let's help hand out the snacks,[n]Aigis-san.

[msg MSG_032 [Aigis]]
Understood. I will take the snacks and[n]go full-auto on the townspeople.

[msg MSG_033 [Rise]]
Wait, don't do that!

[msg MSG_034 [Haru]]
Phew... It's finally over. Everyone[n]looked like they had a really good time.

[msg MSG_035 [Teddie]]
Everyone was so happy! Do you think[n]they're all cheered up now?

[msg MSG_036 [Rise]]
Yeah, it didn't turn out exactly how I[n]pictured it, but... I think this one was[n]all thanks to Teddie.

[msg MSG_037 [Teddie]]
Yeees! Does that mean I'm one of you[n]now? Is it time for girl talk?

[msg MSG_038 [Rise]]
Sure, sure, we'll get to that later.[n]Head on back to the theater, guys!

[msg MSG_039 [Aigis]]
Understood, beginning return journey.
