[msg MSG_000 [Elizabeth]]
Now then, for the special screening my[n]worthless brother requested...
You are to find the "Futuristic Gizmo"[n]in Junessic Land.

[msg MSG_001 [Naoto]]
I'm rather curious about this[n]"Futuristic Gizmo."

[msg MSG_002 [Fuuka]]
I'm excited to see it as well.
I bet it uses technology we could only[n]dream of in our day and age.

[msg MSG_003 [Yusuke]]
Yes, I, too, would like to take a look.[n]My heart is ready.

[sel SEL_004 top]
You too?
You like machines?

[msg MSG_005 [Yusuke]]
Well, I know very little about machines,[n]but, yes, I'm quite interested.
If this mechanism is as technologically[n]impressive as it sounds, then there's[n]surely some beauty in it.

[msg MSG_006 [Naoto]]
Of course. It's only natural for a[n]perfectly-made machine to have some[n]elegance in its design.

[msg MSG_007 [Yusuke]]
Precisely, Shirogane-san!
Not only that, but this futuristic[n]technology likely contains ideas the[n]likes of which we've never seen...
And THAT will undoubtedly stimulate my[n]creativity!

[msg MSG_008 [Futaba]]
Whoa. Who'da thought he'd be interested?
So where do we find this thing?

[msg MSG_009 [Elizabeth]]
The mechanism in question is in a[n]container.

[msg MSG_010 [Akechi]]
There were a lot of containers. I wonder[n]which one.
Also, I should say, it didn't look as[n]though any of those containers would[n]open very easily.

[msg MSG_011 [Fuuka]]
Hmm, that is a problem.

[msg MSG_012 [Naoto]]
Oh right. Does anyone else remember?
We saw that broken container when we[n]were looking for Yosuke-senpai.

[msg MSG_013 [Yusuke]]
Ah, the one that was already open! We'll[n]be able to look inside!

[msg MSG_014 [Naoto]]
Oh, I just remembered.
We came across a broken container while[n]we were searching for Yosuke-senpai.

[msg MSG_015 [Akechi]]
Now that you mention it, I do remember[n]seeing one.
It was just big enough for someone to[n]fit inside.

[sel SEL_016 top]
Let's check it out.
Time to investigate.

[msg MSG_017 [Naoto]]
Right. Then, let's head out.

[msg MSG_018 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_019 [Fuuka]]
Oh dear, I'm getting anxious.

[msg MSG_020 [Yusuke]]
Let us depart, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]. The "Futuristic[n]Gizmo" awaits!
