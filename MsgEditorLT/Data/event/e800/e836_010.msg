The request this time is to "gather[n]parts for a communication device."
Defeat the Roaring Turret within the[n]A.I.G.I.S. movie, and...
Gather three Futuristic Gizmos from its[n]remains.

[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
This is for some "communication device"?[n]The hell's that supposed to mean?

[msg MSG_002 [Elizabeth]]
This request specifically comes from the[n]three navigatrices of your team.

[msg MSG_003 [P4 Hero]]
Navigatrices...? You mean Rise and the[n]others?

[msg MSG_004 [Rise]]
Yeah! So, the thing is...

[msg MSG_005 [Mitsuru]]
That's familiar. A communication device[n]that'll increase your navigational[n]abilities...?

[msg MSG_006 [Fuuka]]
Right. We don't want to ask the[n]impossible, so... What do you all think?

[msg MSG_007 [Ryuji]]
What do ya think, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]?

[sel SEL_008 top]
We're on it.
Sounds kind of hard.

[msg MSG_009 [Ryuji]]
Yeah! Let's do this!

[msg MSG_010 [Ryuji]]
Aw, man... We can at least try, right?
If we can pull this off, it'll make[n]battles easier too, dontcha think?

[msg MSG_011 [Mitsuru]]
Indeed. It seems like a fine pursuitâ€•[n]for the practical advantages, if nothing[n]else.

[msg MSG_012 [Futaba]]
Really!? You guys'll take it?

[msg MSG_013 [Chie]]
Of course! Even if it wasn't gonna make[n]us stronger, it's a request from our[n]friends!

[msg MSG_014 [Yusuke]]
I agree. There seems little sense in[n]denying the request. I shall help.

[msg MSG_015 [Rise]]
Thanks so much, everyone! I'm counting[n]on you guys!
