There's two warp spots here! Which one[n]do we take?

[msg MSG_001 [Naoto]]
Hmm... This is the first actual fork in[n]the road we've encountered.
If we guess wrong here, it could[n]significantly slow down our efforts.

[msg MSG_002 [Junpei]]
Uhh, what about that paperback there?[n]What did it say?

[sel SEL_003 top]
GROWL.
GROW.
CROW.

[msg MSG_004 [Ann]]
No, it was "GROW." I'm pretty sure there[n]weren't any extra L's in there.

[msg MSG_005 [Teddie]]
But an L would make it grrrowly...

[msg MSG_006 [Ann]]
Growl if you want, but I'm pretty used[n]to correcting people on L's and R's...

[msg MSG_007 [Teddie]]
Grrr... Rrrrgh... Grrrawr!
GrrAWK!
Owie... I sprained my tongue...

[msg MSG_008 [Yosuke]]
You actually have a tongue in there...?[n]That's news to me.

[msg MSG_009 [Makoto]]
That's right, it was "GROW." Like a[n]plant growing larger. Or a person[n]maturing, I suppose.

[msg MSG_010 [Ryuji]]
Man, that's how you say it? I thought it[n]rhymed with "chow."

[msg MSG_011 [Makoto]]
You should really pay more attention in[n]English... If you listened to the[n]teacher, you'd know the pronunciation.

[msg MSG_012 [Ryuji]]
Yeah, yeah...

[msg MSG_013 [Ann]]
No, it was "GROW." It was a "G," not a[n]"C."

[msg MSG_014 [Naoto]]
"CROW." As in the scavenger bird, I[n]assume.

[msg MSG_015 [Rise]]
Crow, huh? Wasn't that Akechi-san's[n]codename?

[msg MSG_016 [Junpei]]
Crow's a student and a detective, huh?[n]Hope he doesn't Crow-k from all the[n]stress! Get it?

[msg MSG_017 [Yukari]]
*sigh* It takes guts to deliver a pun[n]that bad with that kind of enthusiasm.

[msg MSG_018 [Shinjiro]]
Hey, you're not gonna join the[n]conversation?

[msg MSG_019 [Akechi]]
Well well, a chat with Aragaki-kun! This[n]is rare.
I'm still fairly new to the group, and[n]I'm not good with crowds, so I prefer to[n]keep my distance.

[msg MSG_020 [Shinjiro]]
Oh yeah? Well, suit yourself.

[msg MSG_021 [Akechi]]
What about you?
I always see you walking a few steps[n]behind the rest of the group. Is there a[n]reason for that?

[msg MSG_022 [Shinjiro]]
Tch... I don't have a good reason. Just[n]something I do.

[msg MSG_023 [Akechi]]
Haha, I meant no offense. You don't have[n]to tell me if you don't want to.

[msg MSG_024 [Akechi]]
They really do get along well, don't[n]they?
When I'm in the middle of it, it's[n]almost too much for me...

[msg MSG_025 [Shinjiro]]
......

[msg MSG_026 [Akechi]]
Well, I suppose I'm just more[n]comfortable this way.

[msg MSG_027 [Shinjiro]]
...Are you now.

[msg MSG_028 [Akechi]]
Well! It seems we're moving again.
"GROW," was it? I wonder which is the[n]correct path...
