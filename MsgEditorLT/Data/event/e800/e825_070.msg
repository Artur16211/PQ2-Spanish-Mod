Perhaps this one was a bit too easy for[n]you. You made excellent time.
The purpose of this screening was to see[n]how strong you've all become. A very[n]pleasant film indeed.
Here is your reward. I look forward to[n]the next showing.

[msg MSG_001 [Aigis]]
I was able to gather some data as well.[n]Thank you, everyone, for your[n]cooperation.

[msg MSG_002 [Yosuke]]
Haha, of course. We're all here to help.

[msg MSG_003 [P3 Hero]]
Thank youâ€•that's reassuring. It almost[n]makes being separated from the group[n]feel like some kind of dream.

[msg MSG_004 [Junpei]]
Speaking of which, what were you two[n]doing all that time, [f 6 1 16 0 0]?

[msg MSG_005 [P3 Hero]]
Well... I wasn't sure what to do once I[n]realized I'd dropped the Evoker.
We tried our best to get away, but we[n]ended up cornering ourselves.

[sel SEL_006 top]
We're glad you're okay.
That must've been tough.

[msg MSG_007 [P3 Hero]]
Thanks, it was a close call. You really[n]saved us back there.

[msg MSG_008 [Mitsuru]]
True, but the two of you were able to[n]hold your own. I'd expect nothing less.
Of course, we'll be counting on you as[n]well, Aigis, provided you're willing to[n]help.

[msg MSG_009 [Aigis]]
Certainly! I will do my very best to[n]provide support!

[msg MSG_010 [Naoto]]
Come to think of it... the Kirijo Group[n]were the ones who created Aigis-san,[n]yes?

[msg MSG_011 [Mitsuru]]
...I suppose that would be correct.

[msg MSG_012 [Naoto]]
Her technology's beyond anything I could[n]possibly imagine... She looks almost[n]human.
She can even use Personas. Exactly what[n]sorts of experiments did they[n]perform...?

[msg MSG_013 [Mitsuru]]
It'll take some time to explain, but...

[msg MSG_014 [Aigis]]
......

[msg MSG_015 [Naoto]]
......?

[msg MSG_016 [Futaba]]
Hehehe, don't sweat the small stuff![n]Robot girls are super moe! Totally[n]legit!

[msg MSG_017 [Aigis]]
Moe...? Legit...?
I'm afraid these terms are not in my[n]database. What do they mean?

[msg MSG_018 [P3 Hero]]
Hahah. I think she means you're amazing,[n]Aigis.
Either way, I owe you one. Thanks for[n]helping Aigis.

[sel SEL_019 top]
No problem.
We're a team, right?

[msg MSG_020 [P3 Hero]]
Haha, spoken like a true leader. I could[n]learn a lot from you.

[msg MSG_021 [Aigis]]
I too will do my best to become more[n]"moe" and "legit"!

[msg MSG_022 [P3 Hero]]
I'm looking forward to us working[n]together.
