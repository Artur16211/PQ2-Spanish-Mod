[msg MSG_000 [Aigis]]
...Excuse me, I have a question.

[msg MSG_001 [Rise]]
What is it, Aigis?

[msg MSG_002 [Aigis]]
How exactly are we to encourage these[n]people?

[msg MSG_003 [Haru]]
Oh, yeah... we didn't really come up[n]with a plan, did we?
I was more or less going to wing it.[n]Maybe just tell them that everything[n]will be okay?

[msg MSG_004 [Rise]]
Hmm... If we want to do more than that,[n]we'll have to come up with an idea.

[msg MSG_005 [Teddie]]
Considering all of you lovely ladies[n]were specially chosen for this special[n]screening...
The ability to encourage someone must be[n]a prerequisite to becoming a pretty[n]girl!
So if I learn the proper techniques for[n]encouraging others, I can become even[n]more beautiful!
All right, everyone! Teach me your[n]secrets!

[msg MSG_006 [Rise]]
Hey, that doesn't seem very fair.

[msg MSG_007 [Teddie]]
I'm still a beauty in training. You[n]first, Ai-chan! Let's see how it's done!

[msg MSG_008 [Aigis]]
Me? Let's see...
I have heard that spending some time[n]away from the city and visiting nature[n]can bring solace to one's heart.
To that end, what would you say to[n]destroying this place and returning[n]everything to its natural state?

[msg MSG_009 [Teddie]]
Destroy!?

[msg MSG_010 [Aigis]]
By removing these buildings and roads,[n]we can restore the forests and other[n]greenery.
Is this plan satisfactory?

[msg MSG_011 [Teddie]]
I don't think burning down the city will[n]be very encouraging...

[msg MSG_012 [Haru]]
I agree. I don't think it would calm[n]their hearts either...
So instead of destroying the city, how[n]about we remodel it?

[msg MSG_013 [Teddie]]
Remodel!?

[msg MSG_014 [Haru]]
We could maybe repaint the buildings, or[n]develop some empty land into a park or[n]theater...
Perhaps add a few large-scale theme[n]parks for the children...

[msg MSG_015 [Rise]]
Theme parks!?
You two are thinking way too big! If we[n]want to encourage people, we have to do[n]it on a more personal level!
What about... Oh! Why don't we do a[n]special live performance for them?

[msg MSG_016 [Teddie]]
A live performance? You mean like those[n]concerts you do, Rise-chan?

[msg MSG_017 [Rise]]
It doesn't have to be a concert. It can[n]be anything, as long as the people enjoy[n]it.
Let's do something that only us girls[n]can! Wouldn't that be perfect?

[msg MSG_018 [Haru]]
Should we each come up with our own act?[n]That sounds fun, and it wouldn't take[n]too much time either.

[msg MSG_019 [Aigis]]
I am skilled in precision sniping. I can[n]also take off my head.

[msg MSG_020 [Haru]]
I can do ballet and... chop firewood, I[n]guess? Maybe I'll try doing both at[n]once?
What are you going to do, Teddie?

[msg MSG_021 [Teddie]]
I'm gonna jump out of my suit and show[n]everyone the pretty lady within!

[msg MSG_022 [Rise]]
Good idea! You can even make other stuff[n]pop out too, so it'll look like a magic[n]trick!

[msg MSG_023 [Haru]]
Hey, that sounds like fun! It's kind of[n]like a street performance.

[msg MSG_024 [Aigis]]
I see. I understand now. All that is[n]left is to reach the target area.

[msg MSG_025 [Rise]]
All right! Let's spread some cheer!

[msg MSG_026 [Teddie]]
Yeah!
And then it's all aboard the girl talk[n]train!
