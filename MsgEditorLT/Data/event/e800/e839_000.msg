[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
Yo, Hikari? Why're you just spacin' out[n]right there?

[msg MSG_002 [Hikari]]
I was just... turning over something in[n]my mind...

[msg MSG_003 [Futaba]]
Yeah? What's that?

[msg MSG_004 [Hikari]]
My eponymous movie, "Hikari"...
I think... I think I forgot something[n]important in there.

[msg MSG_005 [Ryuji]]
Aw geez! Quick, let's go get it before[n]something else does!

[msg MSG_006 [Hikari]]
Oh! No, that's okay! I-I don't need it[n]right this second...
It's silly. I mean I'm, uh... I'm not[n]even really sure what it is.
Just forget I said anything. Enlil is[n]more important to concern ourselves[n]with.
I shouldn't have brought it up...

[msg MSG_007 [Futaba]]
But you did! Come on, you can stand up[n]for yourself!
If it's important to you, then we should[n]go find it!

[msg MSG_008 [Hikari]]
Futaba-chan, really... I don't want to[n]be a bother.

[msg MSG_009 [Ryuji]]
Way too late for that! We should just[n]get this over with.
Otherwise we'll be hearing about it[n]later, anyways.

[msg MSG_010 [Junpei]]
Don't get so down on Hikari-chan; she[n]just didn't want to be a burden. But she[n]doesn't know this stuff is easy for us!

[msg MSG_011 [Yukari]]
How do you know?

[msg MSG_012 [Junpei]]
Because it is I, SEES' best guy, right[n]in front of your eye! Can't you see the[n]greatness of SEES?

[msg MSG_013 [Yukari]]
...Never speak to me again.

[msg MSG_014 [Junpei]]
But I'll miss you, Yuka-tan!

[msg MSG_015 [Yosuke]]
Give it a rest. And don't forget that[n]the Investigation Team is here, too![n]Right, partner?

[msg MSG_016 [P4 Hero]]
That's right. We're the ones Hikari can[n]really rely on.

[sel SEL_017 top]
Absolutely.
Do we have to...?

[msg MSG_018 [Morgana]]
Mm-hm. We can get it done in no time.

[msg MSG_019 [Yosuke]]
Yeah, leave it to us!

[msg MSG_020 [Junpei]]
And you got this guy, the best that SEES[n]has ever seen!

[msg MSG_021 [Futaba]]
You can count on me to navigate. And[n]with Fuuka and Rise, you've got yourself[n]a solid bedrock of support!

[msg MSG_022 [Ryuji]]
Come on, don't be a whiner.
With all of us together, we're[n]practically invincible. Nothin' can[n]stand in our way.

[msg MSG_023 [Morgana]]
Hear that, guys? We're invincible. Ryuji[n]says so, and we all know he's a guy who[n]NEVER exaggerates.
But whatever, I'm sure we all agree that[n]we're powerful enough to solve Hikari's[n]problem pretty quickly.

[msg MSG_024 [Yosuke]]
Yeah, leave it to us!

[msg MSG_025 [Junpei]]
And I hope she sees that SEES accepts[n]only the best!

[msg MSG_026 [Futaba]]
I dunno about that, I've heard there's been a[n]sea change in SEES standards, heh. Unlike us,[n]the navigators, of course.

[msg MSG_027 [Hikari]]
You guys... I don't know what to say![n]Thank you so much.
So... you really don't mind helping me?

[msg MSG_028 [Ryuji]]
Don't sweat it!

[msg MSG_029 [Futaba]]
There you have it, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]. We'll be[n]counting on your leadership when the[n]time comes!

[msg MSG_030]
A new special screening: "The Shape of[n]Bonds" has been added to the box office.
