[msg MSG_000 [Theodore]]
Nothing less than incredible. I accept[n]my loss.

[sel SEL_001 top]
You gave us a hard fight.
That was a breeze.

[msg MSG_002 [Theodore]]
Ah, you are too kind. I only hope we can[n]have another bout someday.

[msg MSG_003 [Theodore]]
I am glad indeed to hear it! You've[n]grown quite strong―moreso than I had[n]anticipated.

[msg MSG_004 [Theodore]]
So, are you quite finished, Sister? Why[n]did you ask for such a bout...?
...Hm?

[msg MSG_005]
The film that looked sooty is now[n]glowing faintly...

[msg MSG_006 [Futaba]]
Hey, the film's going all shiny!

[msg MSG_007 [Yusuke]]
It's faint, yes... but how oddly[n]beautiful.

[msg MSG_008 [Elizabeth]]
It's just as I thought.

[msg MSG_008_1 [Elizabeth]]
When you first acquired that film, it[n]was nothing more than a simple piece of[n]junk...
But through its bearer displaying[n]sufficient power, I believe it will[n]regain its original shine.

[msg MSG_009 [Theodore]]
I see! So that was your intent...
claimed victory against me, and in doing[n]so, displayed great strength.

[msg MSG_010 [Haru]]
Um, you said this film is related[n]to-kun's power of the wild card,[n]correct?

[msg MSG_010_1 [Haru]]
How about it, [f 6 1 29 0 0 0]-kun? Do you feel[n]any different?

[sel SEL_011 top]
No, not really.
Power flows through me...

[msg MSG_012 [Akechi]]
Hmm... I have to say, I'm not seeing[n]much changed on the outside.

[msg MSG_013 [Akechi]]
Really? You look the same as ever...

[msg MSG_014 [Elizabeth]]
Grrrr... I am quite flummoxed.
Could my judgment have been wrong? Ah,[n]no, that cannot be...

[msg MSG_015 [Theodore]]
You mustn't lose hope, Sister.
I battled them as an arbiter of power,[n]and in doing so, the film clearly[n]underwent some change.
So at the very least, your conjecture[n]was close to the truth, yes?

[msg MSG_016 [Akechi]]
True. There's various possibilities to[n]this.
Perhaps this isn't the only film of its[n]kind out there? If we collect more...

[msg MSG_017 [Elizabeth]]
......!

[msg MSG_018 [Makoto]]
We found this film after a special[n]screening where we needed-kun to fight,[n]right?
I could see there being other screenings[n]like it, maybe also requiring specific[n]people...

[msg MSG_019 [Elizabeth]]
For a moment, I gave in to despair. Yet[n]now, I see a world of possibility[n]opening up before me.
Well then, let us wait until we find[n]these other screenings! Possibilities[n]are limitless, after all.

[msg MSG_020 [Futaba]]
Ahaha... She swings back fast.

[msg MSG_021 [Elizabeth]]
In any case, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]... You and your[n]allies have put on a marvelous display.
Your bout against Theo was separate from[n]the special showings, but I've prepared[n]a humble reward for you.
Please accept it later, as a token of[n]gratitude from we who govern power.

[msg MSG_022 [Ryuji]]
Whoa, for real!? Thanks a lot, lady!

[msg MSG_023 [Elizabeth]]
*chuckle* No thanks necessary.
Nothing pleases us more than watching[n]over your growth.

[msg MSG_024 [Theodore]]
Indeed. I must thank you as well.

[msg MSG_025 [Elizabeth]]
......
So, Theo? How shall you reward them?

[msg MSG_026 [Theodore]]
Um...?

[msg MSG_027 [Elizabeth]]
You govern power, just as I do. Surely[n]you have some kind of gift to offer for[n]their troubles?

[msg MSG_028 [Theodore]]
Huh!? W-Well, this is all so sudden―

[msg MSG_029 [Elizabeth]]
You're not going to embarrass your[n]sister, are you? Hop to it!

[msg MSG_030 [Theodore]]
I-I know! How about this?
I shall give you one of my greatest[n]creations―something I've made with the[n]utmost care.

[msg MSG_031 [Futaba]]
Whoa, we're getting a certified Theodore[n]masterwork! So what is it?

[msg MSG_032 [Theodore]]
Why, nothing less than a masterpiece. I[n]present the pride of my craft...
The Velvet-style Artisanal Hot Dog!

[msg MSG_033 [Haru]]
...Um...

[msg MSG_034 [Yukiko]]
...A hot dog? Your masterpiece is just a[n]sausage in a bun...?

[msg MSG_035 [Theodore]]
Yes. It's wonderfully suited to pair[n]with watching movies! Please, try one[n]today.

[sel SEL_036 top]
Advertising a new product?
I can't wait.

[msg MSG_037 [Futaba]]
Yeah, this totally feels like an[n]infomercial. Maybe he missed his calling[n]as a salesman.

[msg MSG_038 [Theodore]]
Thank you. Your eagerness vindicates all[n]my efforts.

[msg MSG_039 [Theodore]]
I was very particular about the ratio of[n]meat, the level of bun toastage, and the[n]optimal ketchup volume.
It's been a hit with my sisters as well![n]I'm certain it shall not disappoint.

[msg MSG_040 [Futaba]]
You need a career change, Theodore...

[msg MSG_041 [Theodore]]
Sister, I believe you robbed the entire[n]batch of hot dogs I just finished making[n]earlier...
Won't you donate some on my behalf,[n]along with your reward?

[msg MSG_042 [Elizabeth]]
......
Thank goodness, a crisis has been[n]averted. You asked at the perfect[n]moment.
Fortunately, I have one remaining on[n]hand. I present it to you.

[msg MSG_043 [Theodore]]
J-Just one left!? Don't tell me you've[n]already devoured the rest...?

[msg MSG_044 [Elizabeth]]
Now! As this case has been neatly[n]wrapped up, let us call this gathering[n]to a close for now.
I will continue to investigate the true[n]nature of that film.
In particular, I shall remain on the[n]lookout for special screenings that[n]demand someone's participation.
Well then, until next time.
