Okay, let's go over the plan one more[n]time.
We're looking for dinosaur bones left[n]behind by the Ravenous Beast.
If we can find a fresh set of bones,[n]then it should be close by!

[msg MSG_001 [Akechi]]
I'll be examining the bones, so that[n]part's covered.

[msg MSG_002 [Koromaru]]
Arf, arf!

[msg MSG_003 [Akechi]]
......?
What's wrong, Koromaru-kun?

[sel SEL_004 top]
He wants to help.
He's hungry.

[msg MSG_005 [Ken]]
Yeah, looks like it. He says he's good[n]at tracking.

[msg MSG_006 [Ken]]
No... It looks like he wants to help.

[msg MSG_007 [Akechi]]
Haha, I see. That's reassuring.

[msg MSG_008 [Chie]]
Huh, they do kinda look like they go[n]togetherâ€•like an investigator and a[n]police dog!

[msg MSG_009 [Akechi]]
Ahaha, you think so? Well then, I'm[n]counting on you, Koromaru-kun.
Do you think you can lead us to some[n]bones right now?

[msg MSG_010 [Koromaru]]
*sniff* *sniff*

[msg MSG_011 [Koromaru]]
Arf, arf!

[msg MSG_012 [Akechi]]
Um, does that mean...?

[msg MSG_013 [Ken]]
It sounds like we should head east.

[msg MSG_014 [Akechi]]
I see. That's a rather keen sense of[n]smell. Shall we get going, then?
