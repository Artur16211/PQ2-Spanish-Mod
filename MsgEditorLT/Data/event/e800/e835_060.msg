Looks like we're comin' up on the end,[n]guys!

[msg MSG_001 [Junpei]]
About time... So this is our Easter egg,[n]huh!?
...Wait, what?

[sel SEL_002 top]
It's just a picture.
It's... technically an egg.

[msg MSG_003 [Junpei]]
That's all!? What about my million[n]yen...?

[msg MSG_004 [Ann]]
Ahaha, that's a bit of a letdown, but[n]it's not all bad, right?
Trying to find it was kinda fun. It was[n]like a game.

[msg MSG_005 [Haru]]
I think, now, I have a better idea of[n]what Easter was like for you, Panther.

[msg MSG_006 [Futaba]]
Hmm, I guess video games aren't the only[n]kinds of games out there.
I'll need to familiarize myself with the[n]other, more participatory types too.

[msg MSG_007 [Junpei]]
Y-You think if we do it a second time, a[n]secret boss will show up and drop the[n]real treasure...? Maybe?

[msg MSG_008 [Futaba]]
Give it up, Junpei. The game's over...
