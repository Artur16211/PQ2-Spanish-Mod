Arf, arf!

He says it is dangerous to continue[n]straight and that it would be safer to[n]turn left.

[msg MSG_002 [Ryuji]]
Yo, he knows all that? Man, dogs are so[n]cool!

[msg MSG_003 [Fuuka]]
Yes, Koro-chan is correct.
It looks like you'll run into an FOE if[n]you go straight.
I am seeing some treasure chests that[n]way... though it looks a bit dangerous.

[msg MSG_004 [Morgana]]
Treasure!?
The Phantom Thieves can't just turn a[n]blind eye when there's treasure to be[n]had!

[msg MSG_005 [Ken]]
But there's an FOE too. If we head left,[n]we'll be in the clear... What do we do?

[sel SEL_006 top]
Let's go left.
Let's go straight.

[msg MSG_007 [P3 Fem Protag]]
So we're gonna avoid the FOE? Okay!

[msg MSG_008 [Morgana]]
That's the spirit, Joker! We're not[n]gonna leave that treasure behind!

[msg MSG_009 [Aigis]]
Understood. We will comply with the[n]leader's orders.
