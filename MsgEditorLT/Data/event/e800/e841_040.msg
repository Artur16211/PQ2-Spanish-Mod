[msg MSG_000 [Marie]]
Are we there yet...? I'm getting tired.

[sel SEL_001 top]
Want to head back?
You can keep going.

[msg MSG_002 [Marie]]
No! I can keep going!
I was just a little hungry. And kinda[n]thirsty too...

[msg MSG_003 [Marie]]
...Okay.

[msg MSG_004 [P4 Hero]]
You don't have to push yourself.

[msg MSG_005 [Marie]]
I know. I'll let you know if I really[n]can't keep up.

[msg MSG_006 [Teddie]]
I've got just the thing for all your[n]hard work, Emmy-chan...
Ta-da! I present to you my secret stash[n]of popcorn. And I've got some juice to[n]wash it all down!

[msg MSG_007 [Yosuke]]
What the!? You still had a stash of[n]that!? You better not have spilled in[n]there!
I'm the guy who has to wash the thing[n]later!

[msg MSG_008 [Teddie]]
I-I don't know what you're talking[n]about.
Never mind that. Have we found the[n]flower yet?

[msg MSG_009 [Rise]]
The road forks up ahead. It looks like[n]there's a flower along each path.

[msg MSG_010 [Akechi]]
If I recall... I think the flower to the[n]right was singing a cheerful song.
The left one was singing a more cryptic[n]tune, or perhaps I'd call it unique.
Which one do we check?

[sel SEL_011 top]
Let's go right.
Let's go left.
Let Marie decide.

[msg MSG_012 [Marie]]
A fallen angel necessitates darkness,[n]not light. But they say true darkness[n]exists within the light...

[msg MSG_013 [P4 Hero]]
Sorry, Joker. She's in her own world[n]again...
It should be you who decides which path.[n]Naturally, it would be best if it suited[n]Marie's tastes...
