Well done in transporting the music such[n]a long way.
So this is the melody that plays within[n]the musical world... Without further[n]ado, allow me to take a listen.

[msg MSG_001 [Ann]]
Oh! I love this song!

[msg MSG_002 [Elizabeth]]
My...! I can feel this wonderful melody[n]coursing through my very heart...
Perhaps its emotional power reflects the[n]strength of your friends' desire to help[n]you, Ann.

[msg MSG_003 [Ann]]
Huh?

[msg MSG_004 [Elizabeth]]
*chuckle* Ah, but it would be rude of me[n]to meddle any further.

[msg MSG_004_1 [Elizabeth]]
In any case, the song has left me[n]feeling satisfied indeed. Thank you very[n]much.

[msg MSG_005 [Elizabeth]]
Also... allow me to commend you on[n]returning faster than expected.

[msg MSG_005_1 [Elizabeth]]
For your efforts... I would like to[n]present a small prize...
Please accept this bonus, along with[n]your standard reward.

[msg MSG_006]
Received a Soma Droplet!

[msg MSG_007 [Elizabeth]]
Also... allow me to commend you on such[n]a swift return to the theater.

[msg MSG_007_1 [Elizabeth]]
What a stellar performance... I would[n]like to present a small prize...
Please accept this bonus, along with[n]your standard reward.

[msg MSG_008]
Received a Soma Tear!

Now, you are free to use this music box[n]however you see fit.
It seems that now the box is here, there[n]is no more danger of the music fading,[n]so you need not fear.

[msg MSG_010 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Thanks for letting me be a little[n]selfish, Elizabeth.

[msg MSG_010_1 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Surprise, Ann! We got you a present!

[msg MSG_011 [Ann]]
Huh? For me? Why!?

[sel SEL_012 top]
To cheer you up.
Why do you think?
Just take it.

[msg MSG_013 [Ann]]
Wait... This isn't cause of all that[n]stuff with Shiho, is it?

[msg MSG_014 [Fuuka]]
We just thought you looked kind of[n]lonely, Ann-chan...

[msg MSG_015 [P3 Fem Protag]]
We were hoping we could help cheer you[n]up, that's all.

[msg MSG_016 [Ann]]
Uh, I'm drawing a blank here. It's not[n]even my birthday...

[msg MSG_017 [Fuuka]]
Um... Ann-chan, do you remember how you[n]were talking about your best friend?
It seemed like you felt really lonely...

[msg MSG_018 [P3 Fem Protag]]
We were thinking of some way to cheer[n]you up a little, and we decided we'd get[n]you a little present.

[msg MSG_019 [Ann]]
Wait, what? Now I'm really curious!

[msg MSG_020 [Fuuka]]
Um... Ann-chan, do you remember how you[n]were talking about your best friend?
It seemed like you felt really lonely...

[msg MSG_021 [P3 Fem Protag]]
We were thinking of some way to cheer[n]you up a little, and we decided we'd get[n]you a little present.

[msg MSG_022 [Ann]]
Oh... I see...
...
Geez... I was fine, you guys. You didn't[n]have to do all that for me...

[msg MSG_023 [Fuuka]]
Oh, um... sorry. Did we just make things[n]worse?

[msg MSG_024 [Ann]]
Of course not! You caught me a little[n]off guard, but... no, I'm really happy.

[msg MSG_024_1 [Ann]]
And, well... thanks to that, I just[n]remembered something important.

[msg MSG_025 [P3 Fem Protag]]
A good something?

[msg MSG_026 [Ann]]
Shiho told me once that I always look[n]positive... She said it's part of what[n]kept her going.
If she saw me right now, she'd probably[n]be really disappointed in me.
I promised her I would stay strong. For[n]her sake...

[msg MSG_026_1 [Ann]]
...No. Not just for her sake.
Now I've got all these great friends[n]trying to cheer me up. I have to be[n]strong for them too!

[msg MSG_027 [Fuuka]]
Ann-chan... I'm glad you're feeling[n]better.

[msg MSG_028 [Ann]]
Thank you so much, guys. You're the[n]best!

[msg MSG_029 [P3 Fem Protag]]
*giggle* Friends forever!
