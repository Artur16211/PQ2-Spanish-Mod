The goal of this special screening is[n]quite simple...
And that is to defeat Mr. Bear.

[msg MSG_001 [Makoto]]
Yeah, sounds pretty straightforward.

[msg MSG_002 [Akihiko]]
Maybe this is our chance?

[msg MSG_003 [Chie]]
Huh?

[msg MSG_004 [Akihiko]]
Remember what Makoto said?
She wants to gauge our strength before[n]she can come up with a training regimen[n]for us.

[msg MSG_005 [Chie]]
Oh, I get it! A fight with an FOE would[n]be a great chance to show her our power!

[sel SEL_006 top]
Good idea.
Isn't that dangerous?

[msg MSG_007 [Morgana]]
Not to rain on your parade, but you're[n]up against an FOE.
That's a little much for your little[n]strength test...

[msg MSG_008 [Morgana]]
Yeah, you'll be up against an FOE. Isn't[n]that a little much for testing your[n]strength?

[msg MSG_009 [Akihiko]]
If we're going to test how strong we[n]are, small-time Shadows aren't gonna cut[n]it.
Fighting a powerful enemy can help us[n]see where our weak points are.

[msg MSG_010 [Chie]]
And then our Coach can write up a[n]training course to help us cover those[n]weaknesses!

[msg MSG_011 [Elizabeth]]
Some of you seem unusually excited...
No matter. This could be interesting in[n]its own right... Please let your zeal[n]guide you on this endeavor.

[msg MSG_012 [Chie]]
Watch me go, Coach!

[msg MSG_013 [Akihiko]]
Heh! My fists have been aching for some[n]action. Time for a one-two punch into[n]the finishing blow!

[msg MSG_014 [Makoto]]
*sigh* Whatever you say. Let's just get[n]going for now.
