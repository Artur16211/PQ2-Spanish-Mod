The time has finally come...
Not only will we be able to decide the[n]victor, we shall have a mountain of[n]donuts...
This is hitting eighty birds with one[n]stone.

[msg MSG_001 [Yukari]]
I'm not sure about the competition part,[n]but getting to eat all the donuts we[n]want sounds great.

[msg MSG_002 [Ann]]
Yeah. I'm almost worried we'll end up[n]eating too much.

[msg MSG_004 [P3 Hero]]

[sel SEL_005 top]
You guys have it hard.
My condolences.

[msg MSG_006 [P3 Hero]]
We've come this far, and everyone seems[n]pretty excited about it.

[msg MSG_007 [P4 Hero]]
Yeah. So let's give it our best.

[msg MSG_008 [Kanji]]
S-Senpai... You're the manliest!
