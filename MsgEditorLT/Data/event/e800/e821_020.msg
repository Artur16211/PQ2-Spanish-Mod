[msg MSG_000 [Kanji]]
Well, we're here, but doesn't look like[n]there's anything to eat.

[msg MSG_001 [Yukiko]]
Maybe we should've kept the dish we made[n]for that carnivore?

[msg MSG_002 [Chie]]
Oh, I kept a little bit of that sauce![n]You want some?

[msg MSG_003 [Yosuke]]
N-No thanks, I'm good! We're here, so[n]we'd better get out there and find what[n]we're lookin' for, yeah?

[msg MSG_004 [Yukiko]]
I guess you're right. Maybe we'll be[n]able to make something new.

[msg MSG_005 [Ryuji]]
...Yo, are they for real? That slime[n]they made last time's gonna haunt me for[n]years.

[msg MSG_006 [Yosuke]]
Know this, Skull: those two have very[n]little common sense when it comes to[n]cooking.
You'd do well to remember that. There's[n]no telling what they'll cook up...

[msg MSG_007 [Yukiko]]
...Hm? What's wrong?

[msg MSG_008 [Yosuke]]
Hm!? Nothing! Right, Joker?

[msg MSG_009 [Akihiko]]
Well... it looks like there's only grass[n]here. Should we keep moving?

[sel SEL_010 top]
Let's try somewhere else.
Let's look here.

[msg MSG_011 [Yusuke]]
Just a moment, Joker.
Look here! We've hit the jackpot!

[msg MSG_012 [Yusuke]]
Good thinking, Joker. We've hit the[n]jackpot!

[msg MSG_013 [Yusuke]]
There's parsley, mugwort, wild[n]rocambole, butterbur...

[msg MSG_014 [Yukiko]]
Oh, and it looks like there are even[n]some carnivorous plants here too.

[msg MSG_015 [Yosuke]]
We don't need any more of those!

[msg MSG_016 [Shinjiro]]
Hmm, wild edible plants, huh? Those'll[n]work.

[msg MSG_017 [Rise]]
I know just the place to look too! I'm[n]pretty sure it's south of here.
Remember those trees the herbivores[n]knocked down? There was a ton of plants[n]just on the other side of it!

[msg MSG_018 [Yosuke]]
Yeah, there was, but who knows if we'll[n]be able to eat them...?

[msg MSG_019 [Yusuke]]
I'll be able to tell whether they're[n]edible or not; I've had first hand[n]experience.

[msg MSG_020 [Chie]]
Ohh... I'm not super familiar with[n]vegetables. I know cabbage and[n]lettuce... That's pretty much it.

[msg MSG_021 [Yusuke]]
It's all about instinct. I'll know very[n]well which ones are safe to eat.

[msg MSG_022 [Akihiko]]
All right then, let's go gather some.
You said they're over by "those trees[n]the herbivores knocked down", right?[n]Then, let's head south!

[msg MSG_023 [Shinjiro]]
...Man, guess I'll just have to go along[n]here.
I'll cook everything up real good once[n]you get what we need.
