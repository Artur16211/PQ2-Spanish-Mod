Now then, please make your way over to[n]the KNS-1000.

Understood! I will do my best to destroy[n]the target!

There are multiple KNS-1000s, but it[n]sounds like you can choose any one of[n]them.
As always, we'll leave it to you, Joker.

Looks like the map is set for the[n]special screening. Maybe we can roam[n]around if we have time.
Either way, keep an eye on the map and[n]watch your step!
