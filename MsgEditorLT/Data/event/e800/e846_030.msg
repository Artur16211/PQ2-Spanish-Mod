You did it! You've captured the music!

[msg MSG_001 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Whoa, it actually went into the box. How[n]the heck does this even work!?

[msg MSG_002 [Morgana]]
I have to say, I've never seen a[n]treasure like that before...

[msg MSG_002_1 [Morgana]]
I guess if this world is a musical, that[n]means the music itself has a presence[n]here.

[msg MSG_003 [Naoto]]
Now, all we have to do is return to the[n]theater without the music disappearing.[n]Let's go.

[msg MSG_004]
The music will disappear if you use a Goho-M,[n]Goba-K, or any escape-type skill. Head to the[n]labyrinth entrance without any of these.
