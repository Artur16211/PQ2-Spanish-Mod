Now we have two.

[msg MSG_001 [Fuuka]]
Good job, everyone! That should be[n]enough to get the fryer fixed.

[msg MSG_002 [Yosuke]]
Time for the duel!

[msg MSG_003 [P4 Hero]]
You're having fun with this, huh.

[msg MSG_004 [Yosuke]]
Well, it's not every day I see you get[n]serious about a competition. I'm rooting[n]for you, partner!

[msg MSG_005 [Aigis]]
We will be cheering with equal support.

[msg MSG_006 [Koromaru]]
Awoooo!

[msg MSG_007 [P3 Hero]]
I'll do my best.

[sel SEL_008 top]
They're counting on you.
You accepted the duel?

[msg MSG_009 [P3 Hero]]
Not just me. [f 6 1 13 0 0 0], too.

[msg MSG_010 [P3 Hero]]
I mean, they're cheering pretty hard for[n]me. I'm sure [f 6 1 13 0 0 0] doesn't want to let[n]his team down either.

[msg MSG_011 [Kanji]]
-senpai! I'll be your head cheerleader!
If it's too much for you, I'll rub your[n]back! If you faint, I'm gonna be the guy[n]carryin' you!

[msg MSG_012 [P4 Hero]]
G-Great...
That's what they're expecting from me,[n]huh...?

[msg MSG_013 [P3 Hero]]
Eh, you're tough. Everyone believes in[n]you.

[msg MSG_014 [P4 Hero]]
I don't know if they believe in me[n]because I'm tough. I think it's the[n]other way around.

[msg MSG_015 [P3 Hero]]
Huh?

[msg MSG_016 [P4 Hero]]
Because I have all of them believing in[n]me, I've become this strong.
I got better so I'd never let my friends[n]down.

[sel SEL_017 top]
I know how that feels.
Guess it's universal.

[msg MSG_018 [P3 Hero]]
Heh... I see your point. My friends are[n]what keep me fighting, too.
Feels like we rely on them more than[n]they ever rely on us...

[msg MSG_019 [Junpei]]
Hey, pick it up, you two. Or else[n]Akihiko-senpai's gonna...

[msg MSG_020 [Akihiko]]
I've got it! What if we made flags for[n]each team?
Two powerful rivals pitted against each[n]other! I'm rooting for both of them.

[msg MSG_021 [P3 Hero]]
That's a little much...

[msg MSG_022 [Yukiko]]
I'll get some condiments ready to help[n]you eat all you can.
Maybe some mustard would help them go[n]down? Oh, or some nice, salty soy sauce!

[msg MSG_023 [P4 Hero]]
On donuts?
...I'm good, thanks. It's the thought[n]that counts.

[msg MSG_024 [P3 Hero]]
...Let's just get this over with, before[n]it gets any worse for us.

[msg MSG_025 [P4 Hero]]
Right. Let's head back to the theater.
