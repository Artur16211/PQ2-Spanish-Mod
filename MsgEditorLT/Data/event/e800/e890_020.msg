Well! I believe we all know the drill by[n]now...
You have acquired a new piece of film[n]containing hidden possibilities of the[n]power of the wild card.
Accordingly, I have found accomplices to[n]assist in restoring its light.

[msg MSG_001 [Caroline]]
Hmph. We're not here for your sake.

[msg MSG_002 [Justine]]
We happened to find ourselves bored.[n]That is the only reason we're indulging[n]you.

[msg MSG_003 [Futaba]]
Ooh, double tsundere blast!

[sel SEL_004 top]
I appreciate it, you two.
Don't push yourselves.

[msg MSG_005 [Caroline]]
Th-There's nothing to appreciate! We[n]already said we're not doing it for you!

[msg MSG_006 [Justine]]
If we emerge victorious over you, there[n]is something in it for us.

[msg MSG_007 [Futaba]]
Yeah, you two are tiny. We don't wanna[n]end up hurting you.

[msg MSG_008 [Caroline]]
U-Ugh, the audacity! The size of our[n]bodies has nothing to do with this!

[msg MSG_009 [Justine]]
How dare you underestimate us... You'll[n]regret your words soon enough.

[msg MSG_010 [Caroline]]
Hey, Elizabeth.

[msg MSG_010_1 [Caroline]]
You better not forget your promise! We[n]put those prisoners in their place, and[n]you get us more hot dogs!

[msg MSG_011 [Elizabeth]]
You bet your sweet bippy. Feel free to[n]take as much of my share as you like.

[msg MSG_012 [Caroline]]
You hear that, Justine? I want an[n]absolute, unquestionable, perfect[n]victory.

[msg MSG_013 [Justine]]
I understand.
I vow that they will be destroyed, on[n]the name of soft buns and savory[n]sausages everywhere.

[msg MSG_014 [Ryuji]]
Hot dogs again...? Man, you guys are[n]obsessed.

[msg MSG_015 [Elizabeth]]
However! For it to count as your[n]victory, they must clearly state: "We[n]give up."

[msg MSG_016 [Justine]]
I've no issue with that.
Making the prisoners admit defeat won't[n]be difficult. They'll run home, tails[n]between their legs.

[msg MSG_017 [Caroline]]
Now, Inmate. Are you prepared? If you[n]want to back out, now's your last[n]chance.

[sel SEL_018 top]
Let's do this!
Give me some time.

[msg MSG_019 [Caroline]]
Hmph! Well, you've got spirit, at least!

[msg MSG_020 [Justine]]
We'll see how long it takes to break it.[n]Now, let us begin.

[msg MSG_021 [Caroline]]
Heh heh... What, getting cold feet? I[n]can't blame you.

[msg MSG_022 [Justine]]
We will not run or hide. Once you are[n]ready, come speak to us.

[msg MSG_023 [Caroline]]
What's the matter? You prepared to get[n]crushed yet?

[sel SEL_024 top]
I'm ready.
I need a bit longer.

[msg MSG_025 [Caroline]]
Heh heh... We were getting tired of[n]waiting around!

[msg MSG_026 [Justine]]
Well then, come to the Velvet Room.

[msg MSG_027 [Justine]]
Is that so? Then come speak to us once[n]you are fully prepared.
