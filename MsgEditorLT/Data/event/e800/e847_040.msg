[msg MSG_000 [Elizabeth]]
, that was truly a showing worthy of a[n]hearty "bravo."

[msg MSG_000_1 [Elizabeth]]
Even against an enemy beyond all my[n]expectations, you performed[n]magnificently.

[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
Heheh! We're talkin' about our leader[n]here. What did you expect?

[msg MSG_002 [Elizabeth]]
Your talent was remarkable to begin[n]with, but you have made great strides[n]indeed...

[msg MSG_002_1 [Elizabeth]]
As one who governs power, I will be[n]watching your progress with great, great[n]interest.
Staaaaaare...

[msg MSG_003 [Elizabeth]]
Hm...?

[msg MSG_003_1 [Elizabeth]]
My, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]... You've found something[n]rare indeed.

[msg MSG_004]
It looks like she's talking about that[n]sooty film we found earlier...

[msg MSG_005 [Elizabeth]]
If you wouldn't mind, might I take a[n]look at it?

[msg MSG_006]
I hand over the Sooty Film to[n]Elizabeth...

[msg MSG_007 [Elizabeth]]
......
Hmmmm.
Interesting. Very interesting.

[msg MSG_008 [Morgana]]
Is it something important?

[msg MSG_009 [Elizabeth]]
was specifically called to this special[n]screening to slay a powerful opponent...

[msg MSG_009_1 [Elizabeth]]
Could this be...?

[msg MSG_010 [Makoto]]
Could it be... what?

[msg MSG_011 [Elizabeth]]
......

[msg MSG_011_1 [Elizabeth]]
If my theory is correct, an[n]extraordinary power dwells within this[n]item.
It holds great potential... powerful[n]enough to define your fate, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0], and[n]that of your friends.

[msg MSG_012 [Ann]]
No way! That sounds amazing!

[msg MSG_013 [Akechi]]
But... he seems just like he always[n]does.

[msg MSG_013_1 [Akechi]]
Does that mean there's an element still[n]missing here?

[msg MSG_014 [Elizabeth]]
Naturally, I cannot say for certain.[n]Though... it is a distinct possibility.

[msg MSG_014_1 [Elizabeth]]
If it's all right with you, I'd like to[n]take some time to think this over[n]myself.

[sel SEL_015 top]
We'll leave it to you.
We'll be waiting.

[msg MSG_016 [Elizabeth]]
Well then! I shall take it upon myself[n]to delve into its secrets.
Feel free to check in with me at the[n]counter, and I'll let you know if I've[n]made any progress.

[msg MSG_017 [Futaba]]
Well, that sure was a twist. It's all up[n]to you, Zabby!

[msg MSG_018 [Elizabeth]]
Hmhm... Well, I can't deny that all this[n]has piqued my interest tremendously.

[msg MSG_018_1 [Elizabeth]]
Now, I apologize for the delay, but here[n]is your due reward for your efforts.
