I see. So you pulled the lever, Joker?
The cart will miss the five workers, and[n]instead kill the single worker on the[n]other track...

[msg MSG_001 [Akihiko]]
Sacrificing one to save five, huh...?
Well, it saves the most lives. I guess[n]that's a kind of "correct."

[msg MSG_002 [Kanji]]
H-Hang on a sec!
So that innocent guy just gets run over?[n]Man, I don't know if saving those guys[n]makes it okay...

[msg MSG_003 [Yusuke]]
I agree. You can't measure the value of[n]human life in numbers alone.
I suppose that's what makes this problem[n]so difficult.

[msg MSG_004 [Mitsuru]]
Yes. Queen summed it up bestâ€• There's no[n]objectively right answer.
All we can do is keep in mind everything[n]we've considered, then move forward.

[msg MSG_005 [Akechi]]
I see. So you chose not to pull the[n]lever, Joker?
The cart will continue on its path, and[n]hit those five people... But the one[n]other person will be spared.

[msg MSG_006 [Chie]]
I-Is that really okay? I mean, wouldn't[n]it be better to save five people instead[n]of just one...?
Arrgh, I don't get it! We can't just[n]kill that other guy, either!

[msg MSG_007 [Aigis]]
If we do not make a sacrifice, then we[n]cannot save another...
A condition of remarkable cruelty.

[msg MSG_008 [Rise]]
I don't know what I'd do if I were[n]actually in that situation...

[msg MSG_009 [Makoto]]
Well, like I said, there isn't an answer[n]that's objectively "right" here.
All we can do is keep in mind everything[n]we've considered, then move forward.
