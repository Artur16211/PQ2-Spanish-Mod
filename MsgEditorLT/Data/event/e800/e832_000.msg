...So that enzyme drink is really[n]popular in the industry. They say it[n]makes your skin silky smooth!

[msg MSG_001 [Haru]]
Wow. I actually worry about my skin all[n]the time.

[msg MSG_002 [Rise]]
I've been looking into fasting too. You[n]know, where you go a period of time[n]without eating anything?
I hear a lot of models and actresses do[n]it overseas, so I'd like to try it when[n]I get a little older!

[msg MSG_003 [Chie]]
F-Fasting!? Just thinking about it[n]stresses me out... I could never do[n]that...

[msg MSG_004 [Yukiko]]
If it's smooth skin you want, you can[n]always use the hot springs at my[n]family's inn. That works really well.

[msg MSG_005 [Rise]]
You do have really beautiful skin,[n]Yukiko-senpai.
I wish my family owned a hot spring inn.[n]I'd be able to detox every day.

[msg MSG_006 [Aigis]]
I have a question: Do robots benefit[n]from the effects of hot springs too?

[msg MSG_007 [Haru]]
Um, I don't think that's a good idea...

[msg MSG_008 [Aigis]]
I see. That is unfortunate.

[msg MSG_009 [Teddie]]
Hey there, ladies! What are we talking[n]about[f 0 1 1]?

[msg MSG_010 [Rise]]
Huh? Not telling! It's girl talk... Just[n]kidding.

[msg MSG_011 [Teddie]]
Girl talk!? I heard about this from[n]Yosuke!
He said it's a secret safe haven where[n]girls share their thoughts about love[n]and infatuation and romance!

[msg MSG_012 [Chie]]
Those are all basically the same thing.[n]Also, what the hell has Yosuke been[n]telling you...?

[msg MSG_013 [Teddie]]
I want to talk like a girl! Let me join[n]in!

[msg MSG_014 [Yukiko]]
Huh? Aren't you an alpha male, Teddie?

[msg MSG_015 [Teddie]]
Are you sayin' I'm an animal!?

[msg MSG_016 [Chie]]
Well, you're definitely not a girl,[n]right? You always call yourself a[n]"lonely boy" or whatever.

[msg MSG_017 [Teddie]]
Erk! That's right...
But aren't I as pretty as a girl? That[n]should be enough... right?

[msg MSG_018 [Rise]]
That's not the same! Only girls can have[n]girl talk.
Well, I guess you can join in this time.[n]We were just talking about beauty and[n]skincare.

[msg MSG_019 [Teddie]]
That's not girl talk! I want GIRL talk!

[msg MSG_020 [Haru]]
Whaâ€•!? But...

[msg MSG_021 [Teddie]]
I will enter this secret realm of[n]ladyhood, even if it kills me!
So, how about this? If I can become[n]prettier than the rest of you, I get to[n]join you for some REAL girl talk.

[msg MSG_022 [Haru]]
W-Wow, you sure are determined. You want[n]to join in that much?

[msg MSG_023 [Aigis]]
I am interested in this girl talk as[n]well. I will be recording data for[n]future reference.

[msg MSG_024 [Rise]]
As a member of the idol world, I'm not[n]gonna let you show me up so easily.
All right, Teddie, you're on. Let's see[n]just how pretty you can be!

[msg MSG_025 [Teddie]]
Rrrrraaaahh, challenge accepted! I'll[n]show you my girl power!

[msg MSG_026]
A new special screening: "The Secret to[n]Beauty" has been added to the box[n]office.
