[msg MSG_000 [Ken]]
Hmm, rare materials... I feel this'll[n]really test our patience.

[sel SEL_001 top]
Let's beat up every foe we see.
We need the enemies' locations.

[msg MSG_002 [Akihiko]]
Yeah. If we do that, we're sure to get[n]those materials eventually.

[msg MSG_003 [Shinjiro]]
We'd just be wasting time. Ain't there a[n]way we can go straight for the ones that[n]have what we need?

[msg MSG_004 [Mitsuru]]
Good thinking. We'll want to seek out[n]only the enemies that have the required[n]materials.

[msg MSG_005 [Fuuka]]
There's a large number of those Phantom[n]Mages Theo mentioned around area 4-B.

[msg MSG_006 [Rise]]
We've got a bunch of Flowing Sands in[n]3-F too!

[msg MSG_007 [Mitsuru]]
I see... Hm? There should be one more[n]target.

[msg MSG_008 [Futaba]]
The Rampage Drive... It doesn't appear[n]to be exclusive to any one location.

[msg MSG_009 [Ryuji]]
So we'll just have to be on the lookout,[n]yeah?

[msg MSG_010 [Futaba]]
Yeah, but no set location means we could[n]run into 'em anytime.
Take down those Rampage Drives while[n]searching for the other two enemies!

[msg MSG_011 [Fuuka]]
If the materials the Shadows drop are[n]tough, then it's likely they are as[n]well.
Be sure to use your Personas wisely, and[n]give yourselves an advantage!

[msg MSG_012 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Right!

[msg MSG_013 [Yukari]]
So 4-B or 3-F, right? We'll leave the[n]decision to you.

[msg MSG_014 [Junpei]]
All right, let's go!
