All right! There really are more[n]Treasure Spots out here!

[msg MSG_001 [Morgana]]
Nyeheheh... No matter how many times I[n]find treasure, I still get that rush...

[msg MSG_002 [Rise]]
That takes care of the first one. Two[n]places left, guys!

[msg MSG_003 [Mitsuru]]
Good. On to the next warp point. We[n]should find more treasure there.

[msg MSG_004 [Haru]]
It's a rather large area, so maybe we[n]should mark where we've been to.

[msg MSG_005 [Morgana]]
Okay! Then let's get going! The[n]treasure's out there waiting for me!
