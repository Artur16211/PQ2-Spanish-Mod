Welcome back, everyone.
Even those once-terrifying FOEs were[n]nothing but mere playthings against your[n]current strength.
I cannot help but be surprised by the[n]rate at which you've grown.

[msg MSG_001 [Caroline]]
Hmph, she's exaggerating. We were[n]falling asleep over here.

[msg MSG_002 [Justine]]
You may have won the battle, yes, but[n]your slow pace made for a rather dull[n]viewing.

[msg MSG_003 [Elizabeth]]
Dull, you say...?
I could've sworn I witnessed you two[n]cheering on [f 6 1 30 0 0 0] and his team the[n]whole way through...
Do you mean to say it was all some sort[n]of illusion?

[msg MSG_004 [Caroline]]
N-No!
W-We were just monitoring on the[n]Inmate's rehabilitation progress!

[msg MSG_005 [Justine]]
Correct. We were simply performing our[n]duties.

[msg MSG_006 [Yukiko]]
*giggle* They must be really worried[n]about you, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]-kun.

[msg MSG_007 [Yosuke]]
Well, you were technically the lead role[n]in that showing. I guess they're kinda[n]like your fans.

[sel SEL_008 top]
Don't fall for me now.
Want my autograph?

[msg MSG_009 [Caroline]]
......!

[msg MSG_010 [Justine]]
......!

[msg MSG_011 [Caroline]]
D-Don't be so full of yourself! Show[n]some respect!

[msg MSG_012 [Justine]]
I-It is merely our job to monitor you at[n]all times.
We are to know everything about you,[n]Inmate...

[msg MSG_013 [Futaba]]
Mwehehe, textbook excuses. I'm getting[n]embarrassed just watching.

[msg MSG_014 [Caroline]]
Autograph...? What, you mean signing[n]your name?
Hmph, humans. Why waste your time with[n]something so stupid...?
It's pointless...

[msg MSG_015 [Justine]]
......
I'll have him sign a corner of my notes[n]later.

[msg MSG_016 [Caroline]]
Hey, no fair!

[msg MSG_017 [Futaba]]
Mwehehe, well aren't you popular. Treat[n]your fans well, you hear?

[msg MSG_018 [Elizabeth]]
In any case, you've performed quite[n]admirably, Phantom Thieves.
You've lived up to your viewers' expectations.[n]It would seem that stealing hearts is indeed[n]your specialty.
Once again, well done.
I've readied your reward. Please take[n]it.
