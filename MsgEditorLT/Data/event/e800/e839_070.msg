[msg MSG_000 [Elizabeth]]
I am pleased to see that you were able[n]to successfully find the target item.
And what wonderful friends you are[n]blessed with, Hikari, who will stand up[n]and fight on your behalf.
What an unexpectedly touching film that[n]was. It was so intense that my tears are[n]positively endless.

[msg MSG_001 [Yosuke]]
Uh, you're not crying at all, though.

[msg MSG_002 [Ryuji]]
Hikari, what exactly was the item you[n]lost after all that?

[msg MSG_003 [Hikari]]
Um... It was this.

[msg MSG_004 [Junpei]]
Ohh, I've seen one of those before! It's[n]that thing you use in movies when you[n]say "Action!"

[msg MSG_005 [Hikari]]
Yeah, it's a clapboard. Just a toy one.
When I was little, I used to pretend I[n]was a movie director. I took this with[n]me wherever I went.
My dad gave it to me. It's... sort of my[n]treasure.

[msg MSG_006 [Yosuke]]
It sure sounds like a treasure. Good[n]thing you found it.

[msg MSG_007 [Hikari]]
Yeah...
Hanamura-kun, Sakamoto-kun, Iori- kun.[n]Thank you so much.

[msg MSG_008 [Ryuji]]
No need to get all touchy-feely! Friends[n]help each other out, ya know!

[msg MSG_009 [Junpei]]
For sure. In the world of Junpei Iori,[n]Ace Attentive, looking out for friends[n]is as important as any detective work.
And unlike those two, I don't have any[n]ulterior motives, like wanting to show[n]off or be popular with girls, no sir.

[msg MSG_010 [Ryuji]]
Way to ruin the moment, man!

[msg MSG_011 [Yosuke]]
Shot down in flames... That's Junpei[n]Iori, Ace Self-Destructive for you...

[msg MSG_012 [Hikari]]
*giggle* There never seems to be a dull[n]moment among you three.
I think it's wonderful when anyone is[n]able to make others smile.
That's why I'm so glad I met you. I hope[n]you never change.

[msg MSG_013 [Ryuji]]
Uh, y-yeah, sure thing. I'll try not to,[n]heh.

[msg MSG_014 [Yosuke]]
I, uh...

[msg MSG_015 [Junpei]]
Heh, I s'pose it shouldn't be TOO hard[n]not to change.

[msg MSG_016 [Chie]]
Wow, they're so stiff just 'cause a girl[n]says something nice!

[msg MSG_017 [Yukari]]
Typical boys.

[msg MSG_018 [Futaba]]
Such is the tragic nature of the semi-[n]shameful trio.

[msg MSG_019 [Hikari]]
There's just one more request I have...
I want you all to have this. As a token[n]of my thanks.

[msg MSG_020 [Ryuji]]
Wait, for real!? Isn't it really[n]important to you?

[msg MSG_021 [Hikari]]
That's exactly why I want you to take[n]it. I've made so many happy memories[n]with everyone.
You've given me the courage to move[n]forward, and I want to express just how[n]grateful I am for that.

[msg MSG_022 [Yosuke]]
Hikari-chan...

[msg MSG_023 [Junpei]]
Ngh... Wait, timeout... there's dust in[n]my eye...

[msg MSG_024 [Ryuji]]
All right then! If that's how you feel,[n]then we'll hold onto it for you.
But honestly, I don't think what we've[n]done quite measures up to something that[n]means so much to you.

[msg MSG_025 [Hikari]]
Really...?

[msg MSG_026 [Yosuke]]
Haha, he's right. That just means we[n]gotta make up the difference from here[n]on out!

[msg MSG_027 [Junpei]]
Yeah. We're gonna return your[n]awesomeness a hundred, no, a[n]thousand-fold! That's a promise!
So don't miss the next episode of Junpei[n]and the Duo of Disappointment!

[msg MSG_028 [Yosuke]]
Whaddaya think you're trying to pull!?[n]You're the frontman of Team[n]Disappointment!

[msg MSG_029 [Ryuji]]
Nah, I think that's you, Yosuke. Or[n]maybe you're the captain.

[msg MSG_030 [Yosuke]]
Well then you're the commissioner of the[n]whole league, man!

[msg MSG_031 [Hikari]]
Hehe. This is more like it.

[msg MSG_032 [P3 Hero]]
Well, I think that wraps things up here.
They may be our rivals, but that's one[n]thing they've got that we can never hope[n]to match.

[msg MSG_033 [P4 Hero]]
Yeah. As long as they're here, we can[n]keep on smiling, no matter how tough[n]things get.
It looks like we've each got an[n]irreplaceable partner.

[sel SEL_034 top]
Let's make ourselves worthy.
We should repay them in kind.

[msg MSG_035 [P3 Hero]]
Yeah, let's do our part so that we can[n]always stay together.

[msg MSG_036 [P4 Hero]]
Right. We've all got a role to play...
The very best captain's ship will sink[n]if there are no skilled sailors.
