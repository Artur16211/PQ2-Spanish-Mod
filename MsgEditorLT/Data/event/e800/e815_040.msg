Woof! Woof!

[msg MSG_001 [Akechi]]
Yes, more bones. Another job well done,[n]Koromaru-kun.

[msg MSG_002 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_003 [Akechi]]
There, there, good boy.

[msg MSG_004 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_005 [Akechi]]
Hahaha! That tickles!

[msg MSG_006 [Ken]]
......?

[msg MSG_007 [Rise]]
Wow, Crow and Koro-chan go great[n]together.
A handsome guy and his dog. It's a[n]perfect pair.

[msg MSG_008 [Yukiko]]
He seems to really like you. Maybe he's[n]happy to be teamed up with someone so[n]talented.

[msg MSG_009 [Yukari]]
Ahaha. It's not like Koro-chan dislikes[n]people who aren't talented or anything.

[msg MSG_010 [Junpei]]
Hmm? Why're you looking at me, Yuka-tan?

[msg MSG_011 [Yosuke]]
Well, he's certainly different from[n]another animal I know that only thinks[n]about chasing skirts.

[msg MSG_012 [Teddie]]
Hey! What're you looking at me for!?

[msg MSG_013 [Akechi]]
...Ahaha. I see everyone's getting along[n]as usual.
Now, let's see about these bones...

[msg MSG_014 [Koromaru]]
*whine*

[msg MSG_015 [Ken]]
......
What's the verdict, Crow?

[msg MSG_016 [Akechi]]
Well, these do look new. We're[n]definitely getting close.

[msg MSG_017 [Koromaru]]
Arf! Bark, bark!

[msg MSG_018 [Ken]]
He says he smells something to the east.

[msg MSG_019 [Akechi]]
Got it. East it is.
We'd better keep our guard up from here[n]on out. Let's stay focused, Joker.
