Okay, so our quarry are singing flowers?
I recall there are a lot of flowers[n]here...

[msg MSG_001 [Marie]]
I already put a mark on your map for the[n]location of a flower I liked.

[sel SEL_002 top]
Thank you so much.
How thoughtful of you.
You're really motivated.

[msg MSG_003 [Marie]]
I-It's not like I like you or anything!

[msg MSG_004 [Futaba]]
Ooh, now THERE'S an endangered species[n]of a clichã€’!

[msg MSG_005 [Marie]]
I-I just don't want to get lost; I[n]assume that's true of everyone?

[msg MSG_006 [Rise]]
Hey, stop teasing Marie-chan!

[msg MSG_007 [Yukiko]]
So let's make our way to those marks.

[msg MSG_008 [Marie]]
Okay. I'll be right behind you... hoping[n]this goes well.
