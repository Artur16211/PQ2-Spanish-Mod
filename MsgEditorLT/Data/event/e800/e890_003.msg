Heheheh... It would appear that all our[n]actors are present.

[msg MSG_001 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Theo, those clothes...

[msg MSG_002 [Theodore]]
Ah, this?
Well, this is a rare opportunity for me.[n]Etiquette demands I wear the proper[n]attire.

[msg MSG_003 [Rise]]
But you're not our enemy, Theodore.[n]Fighting you just feels wrong...

[msg MSG_004 [Theodore]]
Please, do not let that bother you.[n]After all, this is no mere fightâ€• it is[n]a formal bout.
Let us battle with no hard feelings. I[n]shall be giving this my all as well.

[msg MSG_005 [Elizabeth]]
Hmhm... I confess I'm relieved to see[n]you've warmed up to the idea, Theo.

[msg MSG_006 [Theodore]]
Perhaps we simply have a natural[n]inclination to this sort of thing.

[msg MSG_007 [P3 Fem Protag]]
A natural inclination?

[msg MSG_008 [Theodore]]
We preside over power. Normally, we[n]simply observe as you walk your path...
But the stronger you grow, the more we[n]feel a certain hunger... to battle you,[n]and taste your power ourselves.
My sister's command certainly surprised[n]me, but now I realize... I long for the[n]thrill of battle.

[msg MSG_009 [Futaba]]
Whoaaa... That line was straight out of[n]a postgame superboss monologue! Is this,[n]like, Omega Theodore!?

[msg MSG_010 [Theodore]]
Now, let us begin. Please, hold nothing[n]back.

[sel SEL_011 top]
Let's do this.
Are you ready?

[msg MSG_012 [Theodore]]
Yes. Allow me to bear witness to the[n]full scope of your power.

[msg MSG_012_1 [Theodore]]
Well then... Here I come!

[msg MSG_013 [Theodore]]
Well then. Let us begin once again. I[n]will be expecting great things...
