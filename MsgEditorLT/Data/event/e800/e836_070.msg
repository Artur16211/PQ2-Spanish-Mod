[msg MSG_000 [Rise]]
Welcome back, guys!

[msg MSG_001 [Junpei]]
Phew, I'm totally beat... I never wanna[n]run anywhere again...

[msg MSG_002 [P3 Fem Protag]]
You guys okay? Everyone still alive?

[msg MSG_003 [Aigis]]
Teddie-san was briefly pining for the[n]fjords, but apart from that, no major[n]issues.

[msg MSG_004 [Fuuka]]
Oh, what a relief... I was so worried[n]for all of you.

[msg MSG_005 [Ryuji]]
It was all thanks to our navigators![n]Thanks a bunch!

[msg MSG_006 [Morgana]]
Yeah, that was perfect execution. We[n]made it out safely because you three[n]were in sync.

[msg MSG_007 [Rise]]
I know, right? We're totally on the same[n]wavelength!
Ever since we started working together,[n]we've gotten to understand each other's[n]style and pace.

[msg MSG_008 [Fuuka]]
Right. How do I describe it...? We sort[n]of settled into roles. Now we don't even[n]have to think about it.

[sel SEL_009 top]
A squad of elites, huh?
You work well together.

[msg MSG_010 [Futaba]]
Mwehehe. We have great chemistry, that's[n]all!

[msg MSG_011 [P3 Hero]]
Oh, we brought back all the parts you[n]guys requested. Is this what you needed?

[msg MSG_012 [Fuuka]]
Oh, thank you so much! Yes, this should[n]work fine.
Now, we just have to build it...

[msg MSG_013 [Futaba]]
Hm, okay... You think we can do[n]something about all those wires?

[msg MSG_014 [Fuuka]]
Mmhm. These parts are in surprisingly[n]good condition, so we might not need all[n]conductors connected...
Could you open a new port on the[n]wireless network, Futaba-chan?

[msg MSG_015 [Junpei]]
Whoa, look at these two nerding out. One[n]look at those parts, and they've got[n]that gleam in their eyes...
Still, Risechi's a navigator, and she[n]doesn't go nuts over that stuff.

[msg MSG_016 [Rise]]
Hmm. I mean, that's true, but...
Now that I've gotten to work with other[n]navigators, I've learned a lot of new[n]stuff.

[msg MSG_017 [Futaba]]
I-I mean, same here!
I never thought I'd be running support[n]with an idol, but...
At this point, who cares if she's[n]famous? She treats me like a friend.
And so does Fuuka, so... having them[n]around makes me more confident. Like I[n]gotta take it seriously.

[msg MSG_018 [Rise]]
Right! I can navigate by myself, but[n]with both of them on my side, I feel so[n]much stronger.
Don't you think we can do so much more[n]with all three of us?
We're not just getting better on our[n]own... We help each other.

[msg MSG_019 [Fuuka]]
Rise-chan, Futaba-chan... I feel the[n]same way towards you two.
We're not just teammates, after all.[n]We're friends!

[msg MSG_020 [Futaba]]
F-Friends...
Mwehehe... Offline AND online friends!

[msg MSG_021 [Fuuka]]
Oh, I have a suggestion...
I think there are other ways we can[n]strengthen our navigation besides using[n]that machine.

[msg MSG_022 [Futaba]]
What, without this comms device?

[msg MSG_023 [Fuuka]]
Um... Maybe more like in addition to it.
If we could aggregate their combat[n]information faster, we could do more to[n]help them in battle, right?

[msg MSG_024 [Futaba]]
With the comms device, we can see more,[n]and get a better idea of the battle[n]situation.
And depending on what's happening, maybe[n]we could use our Personas to physically[n]support them.

[msg MSG_025 [Rise]]
Physical support... So, like healing and[n]ailment recovery stuff?

[msg MSG_026 [Futaba]]
Yep! That's right! This'll be a big help[n]for everyone!
Okay, let's slap this gadget together! I[n]call a navigator meeting!

[msg MSG_027 [Yosuke]]
Aaand there they go with the parts.[n]They're like a hurricane.
Well, we got everything they wanted, so[n]I guess this request is done.

[msg MSG_028 [Yusuke]]
Hold on. I feel like we're forgetting[n]something important.

[msg MSG_029 [Yosuke]]
Huh? Something we forgot?

[sel SEL_030 top]
Reporting to Elizabeth.
I don't know.
Tonight's dinner?

[msg MSG_031 [Yosuke]]
Oh! Right!

[msg MSG_032 [Yosuke]]
Now that you mention it, maybe there was[n]one more thing... but what?

[msg MSG_033 [Akechi]]
If I had to guess, it'd be reporting to[n]Elizabeth?

[msg MSG_034 [Yosuke]]
Oh, right! Man, I've been so absent-[n]minded lately...
Wait, no, dang it! That's not what I'm[n]talking about!

[msg MSG_035 [Akechi]]
If I had to guess, it'd be reporting to[n]Elizabeth?

[msg MSG_036 [Elizabeth]]
Hmhmhm... And so you finally remember my[n]existence...

[msg MSG_037 [Yosuke]]
What theâ€•Geez, where'd you come from!?

[msg MSG_038 [Elizabeth]]
I've been here behind you, this whole[n]time...
Like an abandoned puppy, waiting[n]helplessly, wondering why the master has[n]not returned...

[msg MSG_039 [P3 Hero]]
Uh... Sorry about that.

[msg MSG_040 [Elizabeth]]
No, no... It's fine... Don't worry...
It did not even cross my mind to bestow[n]everlasting curses upon you. Not once.
Besides, this screening allowed me a[n]glimpse of something wonderful indeed.
Now then, here is your reward. Please[n]accept it.

[msg MSG_041 [Elizabeth]]
The navigators' teamwork was simply[n]outstanding. I eagerly await their[n]further exploits.

[msg MSG_042 [Morgana]]
If the navigators' bonds strengthen,[n]their support will be even better.
It was definitely a productive special[n]screening, anyway.

[msg MSG_043 [Ryuji]]
Yeah! Let's keep this up!
