*sigh*

[sel SEL_001 top]
What's wrong?
You hungry or something?

[msg MSG_002 [Junpei]]
Oh, it's nothin'. It's just that life's[n]tough at this age, y'know?

[msg MSG_003 [Junpei]]
What, am I Fox now? Nah, that ain't it.

[msg MSG_004 [Yusuke]]
What!? As if my existence is defined by[n]an incessant, hunger-driven rapping at[n]death's door!

[msg MSG_005 [Mitsuru]]
It seems he's not aware of it himself...

[msg MSG_006 [Junpei]]
It's just, I haven't had time to play[n]any of the games I bought recently, and[n]now my backlog's crazy.

[msg MSG_007 [Yukari]]
*sigh* I seriously couldn't care less if[n]I tried...

[msg MSG_008 [Junpei]]
Aw, come on! Just hear me out!
So that sci-fi flick we were in was all[n]"beep-boop" like a game, right?
We were basically in a fantasy world[n]like the ones you'd see in those games,[n]and that's why I remembered my backlog.

[msg MSG_009 [Futaba]]
Oho? Are you a gamer, Junpei? Yeah,[n]games have a way of piling up when[n]you're not looking.
I've got a pretty hefty backlog myself.[n]I'll get through it one day, though.

[msg MSG_010 [Ann]]
Video games, huh...? It's been awhile[n]since I played anything. Maybe I'll get[n]back into it.

[msg MSG_011 [Junpei]]
Ooh, are you two hardcore? What's your[n]favorite genre?

[msg MSG_012 [Ann]]
I actually don't know that much. I just[n]kinda mess around a bit if I'm[n]interested.

[msg MSG_013 [Futaba]]
I play all kinds: adventure games,[n]shooters, and even MMOs and RTSs and[n]RPGs!

[msg MSG_014 [Makoto]]
Was that last bit her casting some kind[n]of spell...?

[msg MSG_015 [Futaba]]
I'd love to hear about some of your[n]favorites sometime, Junpei!

[msg MSG_016 [Junpei]]
Yeah, you bet. Maybe we can get a little[n]multiplayer action goin' too?

[msg MSG_017 [Ann]]
Ooh, I'm down! We can play a fighting[n]game or something!

[msg MSG_018 [Yosuke]]
That's an unlikely trio. I guess a lot[n]of us are secretly gamers.

[msg MSG_019]
A new special screening: "Easter Egg[n]Hunt!" has been added to the box office.
