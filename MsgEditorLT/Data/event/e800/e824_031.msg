Good evening, and welcome to "Junpei's[n]Believe It, or Don't"...
There are many strange things in this[n]world...
It happened after sundown, in an[n]isolated little spot much like the one[n]we're in now...
As a lone girl hurried home, she[n]suddenly got the strange feeling that[n]someone was watching her...
Out of curiosity, she turned around...[n]and saw a lifeless, worn-out puppet[n]watching her ever so closely.

*gasp*

Disturbed by the sight, the girl sped off, but[n]no matter where she went, she could still feel[n]those eyes watching her...
Something was wrong, she thought, so she[n]turned around once again...
Only to see the puppet from before!

[msg MSG_003 [Chie]]
Noooooo!

[msg MSG_004 [Junpei]]
The puppet began to creep toward her...[n]Creeeeeeak... It grew closer and[n]closer...
Suddenly, it pulled out a knife, and[n]with an ominous, terrifying moan, it[n]saidâ€•

"Give the meat plenty of heat for a[n]nice, seared edge!"
