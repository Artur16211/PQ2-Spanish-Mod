This special screening will take place[n]in A.I.G.I.S.
The title of "Easter Egg Hunt!" seems to[n]suggest you will be searching for[n]something.

[msg MSG_001 [Ann]]
Easter egg...?
I mean, obviously people do that on[n]Easter...

[sel SEL_002 top]
But in a sci-fi movie?
Easter?

[msg MSG_003 [Ann]]
Yeah, that's weird. A.I.G.I.S. is about[n]robots.
I didn't see any chickens there. Where[n]are we gonna find an egg?

[msg MSG_004 [Haru]]
Yeah, Easter is a holiday that's[n]celebrated overseas.
But why A.I.G.I.S. of all places?

[msg MSG_005 [Ann]]
Yeah, that's weird. A.I.G.I.S. is about[n]robots; it's not like there were[n]chickens running around everywhere.

[msg MSG_006 [Junpei]]
Looking for eggs in a sci-fi city...[n]Hmm, that's a pickle.

[msg MSG_007 [Elizabeth]]
I am but an insignificant guide. I have[n]no reason to know further details.
I myself will be looking forward to[n]learning the true nature of this "Easter[n]egg."
For now, why don't you make your way[n]over to A.I.G.I.S.?

[msg MSG_008 [Futaba]]
There she goes, dumping all the work on[n]us again!
Whatever, I've come to expect this kinda[n]stuff from Zabby at this point!

[msg MSG_009 [Junpei]]
Well, this seems kinda fun. Let's give[n]it a shot, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]!

[sel SEL_010 top]
All right.
Let's check it out.

[msg MSG_011 [Ann]]
Okay, then! Let's head to A.I.G.I.S.[n]when we're ready!
