It's a dead end...

[msg MSG_000 [Ryuji]]
...I only know, like, the regular[n]places, y'know? Just take her to some[n]small ramen shop and you're good, right?

[msg MSG_001 [Yosuke]]
You idiots. Girls like places that are[n]romantic!
Somewhere like a hill or a lighthouse, a[n]place where you can see the stars and[n]stuff!

[msg MSG_002 [Ryuji]]
A hill? We ain't got any.

[msg MSG_003 [Kanji]]
How 'bout a mountain?

[msg MSG_004 [Yosuke]]
Don't be stupid! That's totally[n]overdoing it!
I mean a place where it gets a little[n]cold at night, and the two of you[n]naturally get closer... You know?

[msg MSG_005 [Kanji]]
Uh, no... Not really.

[msg MSG_006 [Yukiko]]
It looks like they're having a lot of[n]fun over there.

[msg MSG_007 [Haru]]
Hmm, hills and stars? I wonder what[n]they're talking about.

[msg MSG_008 [Yosuke]]
Oh, you heard all that?
We're trying to see who can come up with[n]the best date plan.

[msg MSG_009 [Ryuji]]
You can't just ask someone what their[n]ideal date would be...
I mean, can't you just go where you[n]wanna go? Like a gym or somethin'?

[msg MSG_010 [Yosuke]]
Don't you think the best place to take a[n]girl for a date is gonna be super[n]different from where you wanna go?

[msg MSG_011 [Kanji]]
Not sure about your hill, Yosuke-senpai.[n]I feel like there'd be a buncha bugs 'n'[n]shit...

[msg MSG_012 [Ryuji]]
Wouldn't it be easier to just ask?
Hey! Ramen or a hill, whaddya feelin'?

[msg MSG_013 [Haru]]
Hm? Do I only get those two choices?

[msg MSG_014 [Yukiko]]
It should be about who you go with, not[n]where you go.

[msg MSG_015 [Teddie]]
If we're together, Yuki-chan, we can[n]have fun no matter where we go!
And maybe you can finally score with aâ€•

[msg MSG_016 [Yukiko]]
Burn it all, Konohana Sakuya!

[msg MSG_017 [Teddie]]
Aaah! It was just a joke!

[msg MSG_018 [Yosuke]]
Man... Yukiko's ruthless. To think she's[n]so ladylike when she's quiet...

[msg MSG_019 [Ryuji]]
Speaking of ladies, Noir's quite a lady[n]herself.
I mean, she's the heiress to that[n]huge-ass company.

[msg MSG_020 [Haru]]
I... I'm no different from anyone else.

[msg MSG_021 [Yosuke]]
C'mon. That elegance? That noble aura?[n]That's like your thing.

[msg MSG_022 [Yukiko]]
Yeah, the way you carry yourself is[n]always so beautiful.

[msg MSG_023 [Haru]]
Thank you. My parents were really strict[n]about things like that, so I suppose[n]it's just second nature at this point.
But you're just as lovely, Yukiko-chan.[n]You're graceful, and your mannerisms are[n]so majestic.

[msg MSG_024 [Yukiko]]
Th-Thank you.
I'm just doing what I was taught...

[msg MSG_025 [Haru]]
Oh... So it's the same for you too.

[msg MSG_026 [Yusuke]]
That may be true, but when Noir fights,[n]she's the epitome of the word "bold."
And that unpredictability only enhances[n]her elegance.
Both ladies are refined, but within them[n]lie passionate hearts. Perhaps they have[n]something in common.

[msg MSG_027 [Kanji]]
...So, ramen or a hill?

[msg MSG_028 [Haru]]
Hm? We're still talking about this? It's[n]kind of pointless, don't you think?

[msg MSG_029 [Yukiko]]
Yes. Incredibly pointless.

[msg MSG_030 [Yosuke]]
Haha... I thought so...

[msg MSG_031 [Ryuji]]
Man, those two'd make one hell of a[n]team...

[msg MSG_032]
A new special screening: "The Ties that[n]Bind" has been added to the box office.
