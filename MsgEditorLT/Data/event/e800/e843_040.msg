Oh, there's the second sign!

[msg MSG_001 [Naoto]]
Well, let's see what it says.
"You stand beside a railroad track."
"You see a speeding cart on the track.[n]Its brakes are failing."
"Ahead of the cart, you see five[n]workers. If the cart isn't stopped,[n]their lives will be in danger."

[msg MSG_002 [Junpei]]
I know where this is goin'.
Look, these Cart Crew guys still have[n]legs, right? Why don't they just run[n]away?

[msg MSG_003 [Yukari]]
*sigh* They're the Cart Crew now? Just[n]shut up and listen.

[msg MSG_004 [Naoto]]
"Straight ahead, you see a heavyset,[n]well-built man."

[msg MSG_005 [Yukiko]]
Oh, that's new.

[msg MSG_006 [Naoto]]
"If you push him onto the tracks, the[n]cart will hit him and come to a complete[n]stop."
"Doing so will save the five workers,[n]but the man struck by the cart will[n]die."
"Will you push the man onto the tracks?[n]If yes, turn right. If no, turn left."

[msg MSG_007 [Yosuke]]
Ugh, another crazy scenario...

[msg MSG_008 [Akechi]]
In execution, it's not that different[n]from the first.
We can do nothing and lose five people,[n]or we can sacrifice one person to save[n]their lives...
But this time, it's not just a matter of[n]changing course. We're pushing a man to[n]his death...

[msg MSG_009 [Ken]]
If we push the man, turn right... If[n]not, turn left...

[msg MSG_010 [Shinjiro]]
......
Look, it's a shitty question, but we[n]need to keep moving. Just gotta pick one[n]and go.

[msg MSG_011]
There's a question written on the[n]sign...
"You stand beside a railroad track."
"You see a speeding cart on the track.[n]Its brakes are failing."
"Ahead of the cart, you see five[n]workers. If the cart isn't stopped,[n]their lives will be in danger."
"Straight ahead, you see a heavyset,[n]well-built man."
"If you push him onto the tracks, the[n]cart will hit him and come to a complete[n]stop."
"Doing so will save the five workers,[n]but the man struck by the cart will[n]die."
"Will you push the man onto the tracks?[n]If yes, turn right. If no, turn left."
