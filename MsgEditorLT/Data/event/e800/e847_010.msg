[msg MSG_000 [Elizabeth]]
Lately, you've all been putting on some[n]wonderful performances through masterful[n]special screenings.

[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
We've done a bunch now, huh? I think[n]we're hittin' 'em at a good pace.

[msg MSG_002 [Ann]]
Well, they're a nice change from our[n]usual! And it's always nice to get paid[n]for them.

[msg MSG_003 [Elizabeth]]
And for a team of such distinction, I[n]have a new ticket to present.
Thanks to you, the "Kamoshidaman" movie[n]was graced with a grander finale than[n]anyone could have predicted.
However, it seems a Shadow of incredible[n]power has unexpectedly appeared in its[n]depths.

[msg MSG_003_1 [Elizabeth]]
For this special screening, you need[n]only defeat it.

[sel SEL_004 top]
So it's powerful, huh?
Sounds easy.

[msg MSG_005 [Elizabeth]]
Indeed, terribly! Supposedly, its power[n]rivals that of Kamoshidaman himself.

[msg MSG_006 [Morgana]]
Hmph. Then we've got nothing to worry[n]about.
After all, we've only gotten stronger[n]since then!

[msg MSG_007 [Ryuji]]
Yeah! If all we gotta do is take it out,[n]we're gonna be done in no time!

[msg MSG_008 [Morgana]]
Right! We've gotten pretty tough by now[n]ourselves, after all!

[msg MSG_009 [Elizabeth]]
How very reassuring. There is, however,[n]one condition I'd like to point out.

[msg MSG_009_1 [Elizabeth]]
The ticket is marked with a name. You[n]see here: "Cast: [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]."

[msg MSG_010 [Haru]]
What could that mean?

[msg MSG_011 [Elizabeth]]
I couldn't say exactly, but we already[n]know this particular showing will be[n]more of a showdown...

[msg MSG_011_1 [Elizabeth]]
Essentially, I believe the intent is[n]that must participate in this fight.

[msg MSG_012 [Makoto]]
A screening that specifies part of its[n]cast? What purpose do you think that[n]serves?

[msg MSG_013 [Akechi]]
Is it a challenge to [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]...? Or maybe[n]some kind of trap...?

[msg MSG_014 [Ryuji]]
Well, standin' around here won't help us[n]figure it out. Whatever it is, he'll be[n]fine!

[sel SEL_015 top]
Leave it to me.
I don't know about this...

[msg MSG_016 [Futaba]]
Now that's our leader! You're used to[n]being the star of the show anyway.

[msg MSG_017 [Ryuji]]
C'mon, you'll be fine. We got your back,[n]just like always.

[msg MSG_018 [Elizabeth]]
Have we come to an agreement? Then let[n]me sum things up.

[msg MSG_018_1 [Elizabeth]]
Please slay the powerful Shadow that has[n]appeared in the depths of Kamo City.
And when doing so, make certain that[n]joins the fray.

[msg MSG_019 [Yusuke]]
Understood. We'll make our way there[n]once we're ready.

[msg MSG_020 [Elizabeth]]
I look forward to a grand performance,.[n]Best of luck to you.
