[msg MSG_000 [Teddie]]
Whew, we made it...

[msg MSG_001 [Morgana]]
Heh, tired already? Some number-one[n]mascot you are.

[msg MSG_002 [Koromaru]]
Woof! Woof!

[msg MSG_003 [Teddie]]
I'm not tired! I'm just doing breathing[n]exercises! Foo-Fooo[f 0 1 1]

[msg MSG_004 [Rise]]
Good work, guys! Make sure you give[n]yourselves a rest before getting back on[n]track!

[msg MSG_005 [Ann]]
Honestly, I'm kinda surprised we got[n]through. It definitely made the trip[n]shorter, though!

[msg MSG_006 [Teddie]]
It sure did! And it's all thanks to my[n]bear-ave leadership.

[msg MSG_007 [Morgana]]
Quit trying to steal all the credit!
If anything, it's thanks to my fighting[n]expertise...

[sel SEL_008 top]
Quit fighting.
You all did well.
Say something, Panther.

[msg MSG_009 [Ann]]
Yeah. We're here because we worked[n]together.
Besides, there's no time to argue. We[n]haven't even found the grand prize yet!

[msg MSG_010 [Ann]]
That's right. We're here because we[n]worked together.
Let's keep it up and go for the grand[n]prize too!

[msg MSG_011 [Ann]]
Me...?
Uh... good job, you guys! We wouldn't[n]have made it through that without you!

[msg MSG_012 [Morgana]]
Well, if you say so, Lady Ann...

[msg MSG_013 [Teddie]]
Hear, hear. I, too, cannot bring myself[n]to trouble such a lovely lady.

[msg MSG_014 [Yosuke]]
Okay, on to the grand prize.

[msg MSG_015 [Yukari]]
Any idea of what that might be?
None of what we've found so far has been[n]particularly beautiful or alluring.

[msg MSG_016 [Junpei]]
It's gonna be something a girl would[n]like, right? I'll bet it's...

[sel SEL_017 top]
Clothes.
Sweets.
Money.

[msg MSG_018 [Junpei]]
Yeah. Something really fancy with frills[n]or ribbons or whatever. Girls love that.

[msg MSG_019 [Yukari]]
Uh, I think you mean YOU love that.
Also, why would he go through the[n]trouble of hiding something like that[n]out in the jungle?

[msg MSG_020 [Ann]]
Well, I do like sweets, but...

[msg MSG_021 [Yosuke]]
Nah, who hides something like that in[n]the jungle?

[msg MSG_022 [Yukari]]
Well, I guess it is better to let her[n]buy something she likes rather than give[n]her something without much thought...

[msg MSG_023 [Junpei]]
Yeah, real romantic...

[msg MSG_024 [Teddie]]
No, no, that won't do.
The one that thing that would make a[n]girl happiest is obviously a passionate[n]kiss on the―

[msg MSG_025 [Koromaru]]
Bark, bark!

[msg MSG_026 [Teddie]]
Wha―!?

[msg MSG_027 [Aigis]]
He said if you do that again, you will[n]be escorted off the premises.

[msg MSG_028 [Rise]]
It's just like a meet and greet...

[msg MSG_029 [Morgana]]
Good one, Koromaru.
Let's ditch this dummy, and find that[n]treasure.
We're almost there!

[msg MSG_030 [Koromaru]]
Arf!
