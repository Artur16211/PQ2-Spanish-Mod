This is the flower.

[msg MSG_001 [Singing flower]]
No matter what I eat, I'm never[n]satiated. Is it a sin to feel this way?

[msg MSG_002 [Marie]]
It technically is... after all, one of the[n]seven deadly sins is gluttony. I could work[n]that in. "The sweet taste of sin..."

[msg MSG_003 [Yosuke]]
Ooh, is that what you were looking for?

[msg MSG_004 [Marie]]
Sweet fruit... No. It needs to sound[n]more tempting... and more toxic...

[sel SEL_005 top]
Forbidden fruit.
Poisoned apple.
Rotten fruit.

[msg MSG_006 [Marie]]
Yes, that's it! You're pretty good at[n]poetry. Maybe you have secret yearnings[n]of your own...?
...The sweet forbidden fruit. Yes[n]indeed, I like the sound of that!

[msg MSG_007 [Marie]]
Poisoned apple... Forbidden apple... No,[n]forbidden fruit!
...The sweet forbidden fruit. Yes, I[n]like the sound of that!

[msg MSG_008 [Marie]]
I dunno, that's more repellent than alluring,[n]isn't it? I want it to sound bad in a good[n]way. Rotten is just... bad.
What about "forbidden fruit"? Ooh, I[n]like the sound of that!

[msg MSG_009 [Haru]]
Looks like Marie-chan's having fun.

[msg MSG_010 [Marie]]
Yes... It's a love story with the seven deadly[n]sins. It's about wearing an angelic mask while[n]harboring such dark secrets...

[msg MSG_011 [P4 Hero]]
Oh, are you done?

[msg MSG_012 [Marie]]
*gasp* NYAAAAAAAH! Was I talking out[n]loud!?
This can't be! Please, stop up your[n]ears! Fling such words far away from[n]your memory!

[msg MSG_013 [P4 Hero]]
Okay, okay. Calm down. Why don't you[n]just tell me if your poem is finished?

[msg MSG_014 [Marie]]
Er, what's a poetic way of saying this?[n]Almost.
If I can just get a bit more[n]inspiration, I think I can finish...

[msg MSG_015 [Singing flower]]
If your soul is unfulfilled... then go[n]NORTH, young lass!

[msg MSG_016 [Akechi]]
Oh, that's right. I heard singing up[n]there. It was deep in an area with a[n]bear FOE...

[msg MSG_017 [Yosuke]]
Yeah, that was definitely up north.[n]Okay, then! Let's go!

[msg MSG_018 [P4 Hero]]
Let's just remember to keep our eyes[n]peeled for FOEs.
