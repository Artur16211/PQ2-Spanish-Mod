What's wrong?
Is there a problem?

[msg MSG_007 [Elizabeth]]
Don't play dumb, you lawless fiend! You[n]disturber of the peace!

[sel SEL_008 top]
It's "phantom thief."
Sorry, what?

[msg MSG_009 [Elizabeth]]
Silence! Excuses cannot conceal your[n]evil deeds, villain!

[msg MSG_009_1 [Elizabeth]]
Form up, Velvet Rangers!

[msg MSG_010 [Theodore]]
The blue of compassionate courage![n]Velvet Navy!

[msg MSG_011 [Margaret]]
The blue of gracious grace. Velvet[n]Sapphire.

[msg MSG_012 [Caroline]]
The blue of guts and glory! Velvet[n]Cobalt!

[msg MSG_013 [Justine]]
...Th-The blue of careful calm. Velvet[n]Indigo.

[msg MSG_014 [Elizabeth]]
The blue of jubilant justice! Velvet[n]Blue!
Together, we are the ultramarine hero[n]team! The Velvet Rangers!

[sel SEL_015 top]
It's too much blue.
No, really, what?

[msg MSG_016 [Margaret]]
*sigh* Look at his icy stare. I was a[n]fool to go along with this charade.

[msg MSG_017 [Theodore]]
But Sister, were you not one of the most[n]enthusiastic to do it...?

[msg MSG_018 [Margaret]]
......

[msg MSG_019 [Theodore]]
I-I'm sorry...

[msg MSG_020 [Elizabeth]]
Now, now, aren't you supposed to be the[n]"gracious" one? Velvet... uh...
Velvet Marine? Velvet Aqua?

[msg MSG_021 [Margaret]]
Velvet Sapphire. You were the one who[n]came up with it. How could you forget?

[msg MSG_022 [Justine]]
Already, I am so tired of this...

[msg MSG_023 [Elizabeth]]
Well... In any case! This evildoer[n]wasn't content simply working us to the[n]bone!
No, he went further! He saw fit to[n]pilfer our hidden stockpile of hot dogs!

[msg MSG_023_1 [Elizabeth]]
Evil must be punished! Is that not so,[n]Caroline?

[msg MSG_024 [Caroline]]
That's right! What, it wasn't enough to[n]run from rehabilitation!? You had to[n]sink even lower!?

[msg MSG_025 [Margaret]]
Was this farce really necessary?

[msg MSG_026 [Theodore]]
In human society, it is apparently[n]custom. One cannot smite evildoers[n]without an expository monologue.

[msg MSG_027 [Caroline]]
You'll pay for those hot dogs you stole,[n]Inmate! Right here, right now!

[msg MSG_028 [Elizabeth]]
That's the spirit, Caroline!
One needn't just go through the motions.[n]A bit of personal investment can be very[n]motivating.

[sel SEL_029 top]
The motions of what?
I'm totally lost here.

[msg MSG_030 [Elizabeth]]
What I mean to say is that food grudges[n]can be quite terrifying. Especially when[n]hot-dog-centric.

[msg MSG_031 [Margaret]]
Ever since you arrived here, you have[n]overcome numerous hardships and grown[n]stronger for it.
That is an undeniable truth...

[msg MSG_032 [Justine]]
As such, your final challenge will be to[n]battle all of us at once.

[msg MSG_033 [Elizabeth]]
This is not an official quest. Thus,[n]there is no ticket issued for it.
If I may be frank, this is our selfish[n]request... a choice of our own[n]unadulterated will.

[msg MSG_034 [Theodore]]
The power and bonds you've gained... We[n]could only wonder: how would they affect[n]us?
Nothing happens simply by chance. There[n]are only inevitabilities...

[msg MSG_035 [Caroline]]
In other words, your hot dog thievery[n]was an inevitable part of your[n]rehabilitation!

[sel SEL_036 top]
I'm innocent.
Hold on a second here.

[msg MSG_037 [Margaret]]
We needn't clarify every single detail.[n]Clearly there are several intents at[n]play here.
And if our presence is a consequence of[n]these happenings, we must make the most[n]of it.

[msg MSG_038 [Elizabeth]]
So you see, this ordeal is the clear[n]result of your grand hot dog heist.
By doing battle, we may be able to[n]resolve the matter.

[msg MSG_039 [Margaret]]
We won't force you. This is merely a[n]request from us.
And you needn't claim total victory,[n]either. Certainly, that seems a bit[n]beyond your abilities.

[msg MSG_040 [Caroline]]
Don't worry about losing, Inmate.
Stealing those hot dogs is a capital[n]offense, but we wouldn't execute you[n]without our master's permission.

[msg MSG_041 [Justine]]
That said, the purpose of this ordeal is[n]to test the limits of your combat[n]abilities...
If you cannot defeat us, we will simply[n]give you an appraisal of your strength.

[sel SEL_042 top]
And if we win?
You think you can't lose.

[msg MSG_043 [Theodore]]
Well... in the very unlikely event that[n]we are defeated...
Then we will have more than simple[n]praise for you. We will grant you a[n]special commendation.
That is the way these things are done.[n]Is that correct, Sister?

[msg MSG_044 [Elizabeth]]
Indeed.

[msg MSG_045 [Margaret]]
You may challenge us as many times as[n]you wish. As your final ordeal, it seems[n]only fair.
*chuckle* I'm looking forward to it.

[msg MSG_046 [Caroline]]
All right, enough chitchat!
The bottom line is that we're punishing[n]you for your crimes. Got that, Inmate!?

[msg MSG_047 [Elizabeth]]
It seems your foul misdeeds have left[n]Caroline in something of a tizzy.

[msg MSG_048 [Theodore]]
Well, she found such joy in eating those[n]hot dogs as she watched the movies...

[msg MSG_049 [Caroline]]
Arrrgh! Shut up! If you're not gonna get[n]this started, then I will!
How about I just take them all on[n]myself!?

[msg MSG_050 [Margaret]]
My my... She's even lashing out at us.[n]This could be very interesting...

[msg MSG_051 [Elizabeth]]
Go forth! Velvet Indigo, Velvet Cobalt!
Bring justice upon those vile[n]frankfurter felons!

[msg MSG_052 [Caroline]]
Now you're talking! Let's go, Jusâ€• I[n]mean, Velvet Indigo!

[msg MSG_053 [Justine]]
...Somehow I knew it would come to this.

[msg MSG_053_1 [Justine]]
Now then, Inmate. Are you prepared?

[sel SEL_054 top]
Yeah.
Not yet.

[msg MSG_055 [Caroline]]
So you're ready to face your punishment,[n]huh? Then come on!

[msg MSG_056 [Justine]]
It is important to keep yourself in good[n]condition... but for a battle of our[n]request, especially so.
Take some time to prepare. We will be[n]waiting, Inmate.

[msg MSG_057 [Elizabeth]]
I'm glad to see you return.

[msg MSG_058 [Justine]]
Now then, Inmate. Are you prepared?

[sel SEL_059 top]
Yeah.
Not yet.

[msg MSG_060_1 [Caroline]]
So you're ready to face your punishment,[n]huh? Then come on!

[msg MSG_060_2 [Theodore]]
The blue of compassionate courage![n]Velvet Navy!

[msg MSG_060_3 [Margaret]]
The blue of gracious grace. Velvet[n]Sapphire.

[msg MSG_060_4 [Caroline]]
The blue of guts and glory! Velvet[n]Cobalt!

[msg MSG_060_5 [Justine]]
...Th-The blue of careful calm. Velvet[n]Indigo.

[msg MSG_060_6 [Elizabeth]]
The blue of jubilant justice! Velvet[n]Blue!

[msg MSG_060_7 [Elizabeth]]
Let's go, Velvet Rangers!

[msg MSG_061 [Margaret]]
Fair enough. It would be a pointless[n]endeavor to fight you in anything less[n]than perfect form.

[msg MSG_062 [Elizabeth]]
*chuckle* Should you wish another[n]attempt at our glorious battle, you are[n]welcome anytime.

[msg MSG_063 [Justine]]
You should know last time was merely a[n]fluke. So then, Inmate... Are you[n]prepared?

[sel SEL_064 top]
We're ready.
Not yet.

[msg MSG_065 [Caroline]]
Hmph! No more going easy on you!

[msg MSG_066 [Theodore]]
I see. Even having won before, you still[n]won't let your guard down... Please,[n]prepare as you must.
