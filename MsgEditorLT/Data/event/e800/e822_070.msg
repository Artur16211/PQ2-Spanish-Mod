[msg MSG_000 [Elizabeth]]
Welcome back, everyone.
What a thrill it was to see you[n]annihilate your enemies; I was on the[n]edge of my seat the whole time.
Now then, here is your reward.

[msg MSG_001 [Ken]]
We did it!

[msg MSG_002 [Morgana]]
Yeah! Having come this far, I'd say[n]you're basically a Junior Phantom Thief.

[msg MSG_003 [Ken]]
Junior...

[msg MSG_004 [Ryuji]]
I don't blame you―I wouldn't wanna be[n]trained by a cat either. Y'know, you can[n]always be my apprentice, Ken.

[msg MSG_005 [Morgana]]
As if you'd be a better teacher,[n]skull-for-brains!

[msg MSG_006 [Ryuji]]
That does it! And what the hell does[n]that even mean!?

[msg MSG_007 [Ann]]
There they go again... and in front of[n]Ken-kun too. Maybe you should say[n]something, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0].

[sel SEL_008 top]
You're embarrassing us.
They're just good friends.
He's MY apprentice.

[msg MSG_009 [Ann]]
Seriously.
Would it kill you two to act a little[n]bit more your age?

[msg MSG_010 [Morgana]]
Urgh... Sorry... I got carried away.

[msg MSG_011 [Morgana]]
What!?

[msg MSG_012 [Ryuji]]
Like hell we are!

[msg MSG_013 [Ann]]
They're two of a kind...

[msg MSG_014 [Morgana]]
You're in on this too!?

[msg MSG_015 [Ryuji]]
All right then, why don't we just say[n]he's the Phantom Thieves' apprentice and[n]leave it at that?

[msg MSG_016 [Ken]]
*snicker*

[msg MSG_017 [Ann]]
Ken-kun?

[msg MSG_018 [Ken]]
Oh, forgive me... I was just thinking[n]about how you all get along so well.

[msg MSG_019 [Ryuji]]
I dunno 'bout that... but we do all[n]sorta trust each other...
The Phantom Thieves are a team, y'know.
We'd never get anything done if we were[n]always running off on our own.

[msg MSG_020 [Morgana]]
Oho, Ryuji, I guess you can say[n]something nice every once in a while.

[msg MSG_021 [Ryuji]]
Whaddya mean, "every once in a while"?

[msg MSG_022 [Ken]]
...I think I'm beginning to understand[n]what it means to be a Phantom Thief.
You've got a lot more conviction than[n]the thieves I've seen in manga and[n]anime.

[msg MSG_023 [Ryuji]]
Say, Ken...
Why're you so interested in the Phantom[n]Thieves anyways? Is it because...

[sel SEL_024 top]
You want to change your heart?
You have a request for us?
You want a costume?

[msg MSG_025 [Ken]]
Huh!?

[msg MSG_026 [Ryuji]]
C'mon, that ain't it.
There somebody whose heart you wanna[n]change?

[msg MSG_027 [Ken]]
Well...

[msg MSG_028 [Ryuji]]
...Maybe someone you can't forgive?

[msg MSG_029 [Ken]]
......

[msg MSG_030 [Ryuji]]
We told you why we became phantom[n]thieves, right?
It was because we all had someone who[n]screwed us over. We were basically out[n]for revenge...

[msg MSG_031 [Ken]]
Revenge...

[msg MSG_032 [Ann]]
We definitely don't deserve any praise[n]for it.
But I don't think we made the wrong[n]choice either.
There are people out there who're much[n]better off because of us.

[msg MSG_033 [Morgana]]
We use our power for others not for[n]ourselves.
That's our form of justice, the Phantom[n]Thieves' form of justice.

[msg MSG_034 [Ken]]
For others... The Phantom Thieves really[n]are amazing.

[sel SEL_035 top]
You can do the same, Ken.
You'll understand in time.
That's our code.

[msg MSG_036 [Ann]]
That's right. You've got the power to[n]save others too, Ken-kun.

[msg MSG_037 [Morgana]]
Yeah. It might be tough at first, but[n]you can definitely do it.
You've got the potential to be one of[n]us. I guarantee it.

[msg MSG_038 [Morgana]]
Make sure to keep up your studies as[n]well, okay?

[msg MSG_039 [Ryuji]]
I dunno what happened to you... but you[n]don't gotta rush it, do ya?
You can decide what to do once you[n]figure out your own sense of justice.

[msg MSG_040 [Ken]]
My own sense of justice...
I see... I need some time to think. I'll[n]decide what to do after that.

[msg MSG_041 [Morgana]]
Heh, that's the spirit.

[msg MSG_042 [Ken]]
Um, thank you very much, everyone!
I've never had anyone I could discuss[n]this kind of stuff with before...

[msg MSG_043 [Ryuji]]
Hey, remember what I said? You'll never[n]get anything done if you run off on your[n]own.
What I mean is, uh... you remind me a[n]bit of myself when I was your age...

[sel SEL_044 top]
How?
You're nothing alike.
You looked in a mirror lately?

[msg MSG_045 [Ryuji]]
I'm not talkin' about looks! It's more[n]like... his aura or somethin'.
Like he refuses to depend on anyone, or[n]he thinks the world is against him―that[n]kinda thing...

[msg MSG_046 [Ann]]
Wow...

[msg MSG_047 [Morgana]]
Ryuji actually picked up on something[n]like that...? Is it gonna snow tomorrow[n]too?

[msg MSG_048 [Ryuji]]
Arrrgh! What's with you guys!?

[msg MSG_049 [Ken]]
*chuckle* I know I still have a lot to[n]learn.
But I hope that someday I'll be able to[n]use my power for a sense of justice I[n]believe in, just like all of you.

[msg MSG_050 [Morgana]]
Ken...

[msg MSG_051 [Ann]]
I know you can do it, Ken-kun.

[msg MSG_052 [Ryuji]]
Yeah, lookin' forward to it!

[msg MSG_053 [Ken]]
Thank you!
