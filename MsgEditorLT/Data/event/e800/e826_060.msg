[msg MSG_000 [Morgana]]
This is it...

[msg MSG_001 [Ann]]
I don't really see anything here,[n]though...

[msg MSG_002 [Futaba]]
Yeah. It doesn't help that we don't even[n]know what the treasure looks like.
Maybe take a look around over there.[n]There should be something that fits the[n]bill.

[msg MSG_003 [Yukari]]
I don't think any of this fits any[n]bill...

[msg MSG_004 [Junpei]]
Word... It's just a buncha plants...

[msg MSG_005 [Teddie]]
WOOOAH! There it is! It's here! And I[n]found it first!

[msg MSG_006 [Morgana]]
What!?

[msg MSG_007 [Teddie]]
Yes, this is it! It's beautiful,[n]alluring and would make a great gift!
Here you are, ladies. From me to you!

[msg MSG_008 [Ann]]
Um... I wouldn't call this beautiful...

[msg MSG_009 [Yukari]]
Sorry, but... Yeah, no way.

[msg MSG_010 [Yukiko]]
Put that back where you found it right[n]now, Teddie.

[msg MSG_011 [Teddie]]
Wh-What!? What could possibly be wrong[n]with this perfectly fine golden[n]rhinoceros beetle!?

[sel SEL_012 top]
Bugs are no good.
I'll take it.
I think only you like it.

[msg MSG_013 [Mitsuru]]
Most people, men and women alike, hold a[n]shared disdain for insects.
Common sense dictates that they're not[n]the most suitable gifts.

[msg MSG_014 [Yusuke]]
I agree. A creature of both size and[n]color such as this is absolutely[n]remarkable.

[msg MSG_015 [Mitsuru]]
Sure, but common sense dictates that[n]they're not the most suitable gifts.

[msg MSG_016 [Mitsuru]]
Right. You might view it as a good gift,[n]but not many people would be happy to[n]receive this.

[msg MSG_017 [Yosuke]]
It's definitely not what we're looking[n]for.

[msg MSG_018 [Teddie]]
Nooo... It can't be...

[msg MSG_019 [Morgana]]
Found it!
Something as beautiful and as colorful[n]as this is sure to win the heart of any[n]girl.
Not only that, but, as an added bonus,[n]it's edible too. It's a gift thatâ€•

[msg MSG_020 [Futaba]]
Yeah, yeah, just show us already.

[msg MSG_021 [Morgana]]
Feast your eyes on... this!

[msg MSG_021_02 [Morgana]]
I've got a pretty good eye for beauty,[n]don't you think?

[sel SEL_022 top]
That's beautiful?
Looks poisonous.
Put that back.

[msg MSG_023 [Morgana]]
Of course it's beautiful! Right,[n]ladies!?

[msg MSG_024 [Makoto]]
......

[msg MSG_025 [Haru]]
......

[msg MSG_026 [Futaba]]
Yeah, that color screams "dangerous" to[n]me.

[msg MSG_027 [Fuuka]]
I saw a frog that looked like this in a[n]book once. I believe it was extremely[n]poisonous...

[msg MSG_028 [Morgana]]
B-But this isn't a poisonous frog!

[msg MSG_029 [Morgana]]
Why!?

[msg MSG_030 [Naoto]]
This color... For some reason, it sends[n]shivers up my spine...

[msg MSG_031 [Yukari]]
...Gross.

[msg MSG_032 [Morgana]]
It doesn't even LOOK nice!?

[msg MSG_033 [Aigis]]
Scan complete. I detect toxic compounds[n]in a concentration far exceeding the[n]lethal threshold.

[msg MSG_034 [Morgana]]
Urrrrrrgh...!

[msg MSG_035 [Ann]]
We're never gonna find this thing...

[msg MSG_036 [Koromaru]]
Bark, bark!

[msg MSG_037 [Chie]]
Hm? Is there something in the bushes?

[msg MSG_038 [Koromaru]]
Awooo.

[msg MSG_039 [Yusuke]]
Oho... Now, this is beautiful...

[msg MSG_040 [Haru]]
Oh, and it smells wonderful...

[msg MSG_041 [Fuuka]]
I've never seen this type of flower[n]before. It might even be a new species.

[msg MSG_042 [Teddie]]
B-B-But it's just a flower. That doesn't[n]count as a treasure...

[msg MSG_043 [Morgana]]
Y-Yeah, that's true. That might not be[n]it...

[msg MSG_044 [Yosuke]]
Says the guys that picked a bug and a[n]poisonous fruit...

[msg MSG_045 [Naoto]]
Hm? There's something buried here.
It's some kind of plaque; it looks like[n]there's something etched into it...
"I offer this flower to you, my love."

[msg MSG_046 [Mitsuru]]
I see. So the researcher placed all of[n]his feelings into this single flower.
There's no doubt this is the treasure he[n]left behind.

[sel SEL_047 top]
Guess we have our winner.
Well done, Koromaru.

[msg MSG_048 [Koromaru]]
Awooo!

[msg MSG_049 [Teddie]]
Grraaaaahhh...!

[msg MSG_050 [Morgana]]
Mrowwwww...!

[msg MSG_051 [Futaba]]
Okay, never mind those two crybabies...
Come on back, everyone!
