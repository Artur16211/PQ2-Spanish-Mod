[msg MSG_000 [Haru]]
So we just have to get through this[n]floor, right?
She told us the layout has become[n]terribly complex, but it doesn't seem[n]that way...

[msg MSG_001 [Futaba]]
Hrrm...? Whoa, the warp points are in[n]different places!

[msg MSG_002 [P4 Hero]]
That's not good. Those things were[n]already confusing to begin with.

[msg MSG_003 [Akechi]]
Not to mention we don't have any[n]information besides our objective.
If only we had some kind of hint to help[n]us find our way...

[msg MSG_004 [Koromaru]]
Arf arf, arf!

[msg MSG_005]
Koromaru has a piece of paper in his[n]mouth...

[msg MSG_006 [Ken]]
Hey... There's something written here.
G, R, O, W...?

[msg MSG_007 [Ann]]
It spells "GROW"... Does it mean, like,[n]physically or metaphorically?

[msg MSG_008 [Mitsuru]]
Perhaps it's some kind of code?
In any case, it's safe to say this is[n]some manner of clue for the sake of this[n]special screening.

[msg MSG_009 [Morgana]]
So the warp points are different, and[n]we've got this paper that says[n]"G-R-O-W"...
What do you think of all this, Joker?

[sel SEL_010 top]
Not sure yet.
Aha, I get it...

[msg MSG_011 [Naoto]]
We don't have enough clues to say for[n]certain right now. Maybe if we keep[n]moving, we'll learn more.

[msg MSG_012 [Naoto]]
Really!? And with so few clues...[n]Impressive deduction.

[msg MSG_013 [Naoto]]
In any case, we'll follow your lead,[n]Joker. Let's keep moving for now.
