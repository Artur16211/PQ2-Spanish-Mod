Phew... Looks like we made it past the[n]gates somehow.

[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
Those security changes didn't mean squat[n]to us. We got thisâ€•no problem.

[msg MSG_002 [Morgana]]
Don't relax just yet, Skull. You're[n]gonna get tripped up if you don't pay[n]attention.

[msg MSG_003 [Makoto]]
I have to say, though, the amount of[n]machines coupled with the lack of people[n]is pretty unsettling...

[msg MSG_004 [Junpei]]
Oh? You scared, Queen?

[msg MSG_005 [Makoto]]
N-No, of course not!
Besides, there's no evidence that[n]supports the existence of... G-words.

[msg MSG_006 [Makoto]]
Aaah!?
H-Hey... Did you hear something?

[sel SEL_007 top]
A G-word?
It's your imagination.
There's something over there...

[msg MSG_008 [Chie]]
No, no, no! Stop! I don't wanna hear it!

[msg MSG_009 [Makoto]]
Calm down! There's no way...

[msg MSG_010 [P4 Hero]]
No, we definitely heard something. We're[n]just not sure what...

[msg MSG_011 [Chie]]
C-Can we stop talking about this!?[n]G-words don't exist! There's no way!

[msg MSG_012 [Yukiko]]
They say talking like that attracts[n]ghosts, you know?

[msg MSG_013 [Chie]]
Aaaah! Don't say it! Don't say it!

[msg MSG_014 [Yukiko]]
Oh, you're right. It's some round, red[n]thing.

[msg MSG_015 [Chie]]
Aaaaah! Stop that!

[msg MSG_016 [Teddie]]
Yuki-chan, how could you!? I'm just a[n]sweet, little bear!

[msg MSG_017 [Yukiko]]
Oh... it's just Teddie. Sorry, Teddie, I[n]couldn't see very clearly...
