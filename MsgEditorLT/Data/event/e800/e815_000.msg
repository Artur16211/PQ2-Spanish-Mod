I must say, this place is impeccably[n]clean; I can't find a single trace of[n]dust.

[msg MSG_001 [P4 Hero]]
Yeah, it's like the complete opposite of[n]the dinosaur movie.

[msg MSG_002 [Kanji]]
No kiddin'. No grass or giant bones[n]anywhere.

[msg MSG_003 [Ann]]
Y'know, I get that those bones are just[n]dead dinosaurs, but isn't it kinda[n]freaky when you look 'em in the eyes?
Ugh, I just remembered all of it... I'm[n]so glad there's nothing like that here.

[msg MSG_004 [Akechi]]
Yes. Still, this spotless scenery brings[n]issues of its own.
For example, take those dinosaur bones[n]Panther just mentioned...
Those were a good indicator of whether[n]or not an area was dangerous.

[sel SEL_005 top]
What do you mean?
How could you tell?

[msg MSG_006 [Akechi]]
If you analyze the bones, you can make a[n]good guess as to when the dinosaur died.
And if you know that, then you can[n]estimate how far away its killer is.

[msg MSG_007 [Naoto]]
I see. Fresh bones would mean danger is[n]close by. Otherwise it's safe...

[msg MSG_008 [Akechi]]
Unfortunately, there's nothing like that[n]in this movie; we'll need to be more[n]careful.

[msg MSG_009 [Ryuji]]
Tsk, you should've just said so.

[msg MSG_010 [Akechi]]
Haha, sorry.
I'm a newcomer here, so I didn't want to[n]act like I was in charge.

[msg MSG_011 [Chie]]
Wow, Crow, you're so cool.

[msg MSG_012 [Koromaru]]
Arf, arf!

[msg MSG_013 [Akechi]]
That's right, Koromaru-kun. Your nose[n]won't be as effective against the[n]mechanical enemies here.
It seems this sci-fi city will prove[n]quite the challenge.

[msg MSG_014]
A new special screening: "Beast Hunt"[n]has been added to the box office.
