There he is. This must be our missing[n]dinosaur.

[msg MSG_003 [Ann]]
That wound looks like it really hurts...[n]I don't think he can move.

[sel SEL_004 top]
Let's hurry up and treat it.
Let's find some herbs.

[msg MSG_005 [Yukiko]]
Now that we've found him, the next step[n]is to find some medicinal herbs.
Noir was saying something about a door[n]with vines?

[msg MSG_006 [Haru]]
Mhm. If we can find one, I should be[n]able to locate some herbs.

[msg MSG_007 [Futaba]]
A door with vines... It's prolly a[n]shortcut.
There should be a few around here. Let's[n]check it out.

[msg MSG_008 [Ryuji]]
All right! Then, let's go grab some!

[msg MSG_010 [Yukiko]]
It's too dangerous to leave him here...[n]What should we do?

[msg MSG_011 [Rise]]
Don't worry about it. I've got him on my[n]end, so I'll be sure to keep watch!

[msg MSG_012 [Haru]]
Thank you, Rise-chan.
Wait here, okay? We'll be back to help[n]you in just a moment, and then you'll[n]get to see your mommy.
