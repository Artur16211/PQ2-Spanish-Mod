We're doing what few people ever manage[n]to do... getting to the root of the[n]problem. Even I'm a little nervous!
But I bet it's nothing compared to the[n]anxiety of your much more vulnerable[n]minds. You deserve a new ticket.

[msg MSG_001 [Akihiko]]
Is it a battle against an FOE so we can[n]be better trained?

[msg MSG_002 [Aigis]]
Or is it going to lead us to a new,[n]powerful weapon?

[msg MSG_003 [Elizabeth]]
*chuckle* It's nothing like that. It's[n]something to help with anxiety, to help with[n]all the stressors of your situation...
It's a simple quest. Collect four fruits[n]in Hikari's movie.
It'll be so relaxing.

[sel SEL_004 top]
Sounds like it.
We don't have time to relax.

[msg MSG_005 [P3 Hero]]
Yeah, she has a point. We don't want to[n]strain our nerves too much.
It could be a nice refresher.

[msg MSG_006 [Morgana]]
Let's do it. We're not in that much of a[n]hurry.

[msg MSG_007 [P3 Hero]]
Well, when you consider the weight of[n]the responsibility we've taken on...
I guess a change of pace will do us some[n]good. We could use a breather.

[msg MSG_008 [Teddie]]
Yay! Finally we'll be able to reap some[n]literal fruits of our labor!

[msg MSG_009 [P3 Hero ]]
So, Elizabeth. Do you have any[n]information as to where these fruits are[n]located?

[msg MSG_010 [Elizabeth]]
No, not at all.
But I assure you, this screening is an[n]easy one.
Simply walk around slowly, and look for[n]it! Just give a quick look.

[msg MSG_011 [P3 Hero]]
No hints, huh?

[msg MSG_012 [Ken]]
Elizabeth sure does things her own way.
I guess we just have to check it out.

[msg MSG_013 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_014 [Elizabeth]]
I'll be watching with great titillation.[n]I mean, I'll be here watching with[n]hyperlactation. Hmm... what's the word?
Trepidation? No, that doesn't sound real. I'll[n]just make it easy on myself... I'll be here[n]watching with bated breast!
Enjoy...
