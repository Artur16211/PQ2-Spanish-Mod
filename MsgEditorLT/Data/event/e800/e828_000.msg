[msg MSG_000 [Aigis]]
-san, may I speak with you for a moment?

[msg MSG_001 [P3 Fem Protag]]
What is it, Aigis?

[msg MSG_002 [Aigis]]
*stare*

[msg MSG_003 [P3 Fem Protag]]
W-What are you doing?

[msg MSG_004 [Aigis]]
This feeling... I knew it. You are the[n]same as [f 6 1 15 0 0 0]-san.

[msg MSG_005 [Koromaru]]
Arf arf!

[msg MSG_006 [Aigis]]
Koromaru-san says he also senses[n]something about you that is similar[n]to-san.
What could it be...?

[sel SEL_007 top]
She pets him the same way.
He smells dog food on her.
It's pheromones.

[msg MSG_008 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_009 [Aigis]]
He says he greatly enjoys both of their[n]petting techniques, but that is not it.

[msg MSG_010 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Huh? I don't have any dog food... though[n]I did have that hot dog earlier.

[msg MSG_011 [Aigis]]
No, I don't think that is the answer.

[msg MSG_012 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Whaâ€•!? I'm giving off pheromones?

[msg MSG_013 [Aigis]]
No, I don't think that is the answer.

[msg MSG_014 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hmm... Then, what is it?

[msg MSG_015 [Ken]]
Koromaru is really friendly, even to[n]strangers. Still, this seems[n]different...
All I can say for sure is: Koromaru[n]senses something special about you,-san.

[msg MSG_016 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_017 [Aigis]]
How peculiar... This is truly a mystery.

[msg MSG_018]
A new special screening: "A Fated[n]Crossover" has been added to the box[n]office.
