Is everyone ready? Do you remember the[n]treasure's location?

[msg MSG_001 [Teddie]]
You betcha!
This is nothing. We'll be there in[n]bear-ly any time at all!

[msg MSG_002 [Futaba]]
Oh? What's this...?
There's something blocking the path to[n]the target; it doesn't look like we're[n]gonna be able to get through...

[msg MSG_003 [Teddie]]
A snag already!?

[msg MSG_004 [Morgana]]
Hah, amateurs.
At times like this, you gotta remain[n]calm and search for an alternate route.

[msg MSG_005 [Teddie]]
Grrr... Yeah, yeah.

[msg MSG_006 [Koromaru]]
Woof...

[sel SEL_007 top]
"It's going to be a long day..."
"I'm tired already."
Woof...

[msg MSG_008 [Aigis]]
Joker-san! You can understand[n]Koromaru-san too?

[msg MSG_009 [Yosuke]]
No, that one was obvious...

[msg MSG_010 [Aigis]]
Koromaru-san said, "I'm tired already,"[n]and you responded with, "Me too..."
Joker-san! I wasn't aware you possessed[n]a translation function as well.

[msg MSG_011 [Yosuke]]
Uh, I don't think he was saying anything[n]in particular... Wait, did you just[n]woof!?

[msg MSG_012 [Fuuka]]
It's a longer path, but there is another[n]route to the south.
They say slow and steady wins the race.[n]There's no need to rush.

[msg MSG_013 [Teddie]]
And Teddie takes the lead! Here I gooo!

[msg MSG_014 [Morgana]]
Hey! Don't run ahead!

[msg MSG_015 [Ann]]
I don't think he can hear you...
