Second one down!
So? I know I'm just gathering stuff, but[n]don't I look like a star?

[sel SEL_001 top]
And "best actor" goes to...
Not really.

[msg MSG_002 [Junpei]]
Hahah! See, there's a guy who knows[n]quality when he sees it. Nice job,[n]Junpei. Thanks, Junpei!

[msg MSG_003 [Yukari]]
*sigh* And he was complaining so much[n]earlier... He sure bounced back.

[msg MSG_004 [Junpei]]
Oh? What, am I getting too predictable[n]now? You want me to try some[n]seat-of-the-pants ad-libbing?

[msg MSG_005 [Yukari]]
Nah, I don't think you need to. That[n]kind of sounds like your life already.

[msg MSG_006 [Haru]]
*giggle* Well, I'm glad you're having[n]fun now! There's only one more place to[n]search.

[msg MSG_007 [Ryuji]]
Heh! We've got Joker leading the way.[n]This oughta be easy.

[msg MSG_008 [Mitsuru]]
However, be sure you stay focused.[n]Whatever our advantages, there are still[n]more complications in place.
For the moment, we'll have to cast a[n]wide net to find the final prize.

[msg MSG_009 [Morgana]]
Aha... You're pretty levelheaded,[n]Mitsuru. I was about to say the same[n]thing.

[msg MSG_010 [Ryuji]]
Heh. Says the guy that was drooling over[n]his precious treasure.
Well, us thieves can't get lost in a[n]place like this. I'm countin' on you,[n]Joker!
