Ambling around a fairytale-like world[n]harvesting fruit...
Goodness, it was like a dream on the[n]screen. I felt so relaxed I was falling[n]asleep... Oh, did I say that out loud?
That was a playful exaggeration. What I[n]meant to say was that I quite enjoyed[n]such a calming and pleasant experience.

She was sleeping.

[msg MSG_002 [Ken]]
Definitely.

[sel SEL_003 top]
It was a fun mission.
It was a drag.

[msg MSG_004 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I mean, all we did was walk around, but[n]I had a good time all the same.

[msg MSG_005 [Morgana]]
And it provided quality time for talking[n]with companions, an important thing that[n]gets forgotten in a group this size.

[msg MSG_006 [P3 Fem Protag]]
*giggle* It WAS a long walk where not[n]much happened.
But we got to relax a bit. And I got to[n]talk to everyone.

[msg MSG_007 [P4 Hero]]
So I guess it wasn't too bad. Looks like[n]everyone's morale went up, at least.
So thank you, Elizabeth.

[msg MSG_008 [Elizabeth]]
*chuckle* ...No need to thank me.
My own reward was time to rest,[n]increased morale, and of course...
A pile of freshly gathered fruit!
I am going to eat all of these right[n]here, and then the quest will be[n]complete.

[msg MSG_009 [P3 Hero]]
That's Elizabeth, as cunning as ever...
