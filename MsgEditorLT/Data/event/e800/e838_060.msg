Guh... hah... T-Take that... you piece'a[n]crap...!

[msg MSG_001 [Junpei]]
Whoof... urgh... I'm pooped... Can't[n]move.

[msg MSG_002 [Yusuke]]
They survived such rigorous athletics,[n]and still won the ensuing battle...?[n]Bravo indeed.

[msg MSG_003 [Akihiko]]
Nice work, you two!
This was a perfect simulation of being[n]forced to fight even after you hit your[n]limits.

[msg MSG_004 [Kanji]]
I still... dunno what... you're talkin'[n]about, but... I'm definitely past my[n]friggin' limits...

[msg MSG_005 [Junpei]]
Phew... dangit... Never doing that[n]again...

[msg MSG_006 [Akihiko]]
Training helps you be ready for any[n]enemy, and any situation. That's when[n]you know you're strong.
Otherwise, you won't be able to protect[n]what's important when the time comes.

[msg MSG_007 [Junpei]]
Right... I gotta protect...
......

[msg MSG_008 [Akihiko]]
Okay, pull it together. We're going to[n]train on the way back, too!

[msg MSG_009 [Shinjiro]]
Lemme stop you there, dumbass. You're[n]gonna kill these two.

[msg MSG_010 [Akihiko]]
Hm. You think so?
Well, you never want to overextend[n]yourself. It's a shame, but we'd better[n]stop here.

[msg MSG_011 [Kanji]]
Nnnraaagh! I can keep going, dammit!
If Akihiko-san can do this shit, so can[n]I! I'm in it to win it!

[msg MSG_012 [Akihiko]]
That's the spirit, Kanji! Time to break[n]your limits!
What about you, Junpei?

[msg MSG_013 [Junpei]]
Yeah, uh, hard pass... Man, I can't[n]move...

[msg MSG_014 [Akihiko]]
All good. Don't push yourself. Just[n]focus on cooling down.
Alright... Let's do a simple one and run[n]back to the theater! It's a race!

[msg MSG_015 [Kanji]]
You're on!

[msg MSG_016 [Junpei]]
You serious...? I didn't sign up... to[n]be a Race Detective...
...Bluh.
