Okay, everyone. Let's go over the plan[n]one more time, just to be clear.

[msg MSG_000_1 [Fuuka]]
First, we need to get to the spot[n]Elizabeth marked on the map, and capture[n]the music there.

[msg MSG_001 [P3 Fem Protag]]
We've gotta get it in the music box,[n]right?

[msg MSG_002 [Fuuka]]
Yes, that's right.

[msg MSG_002_1 [Fuuka]]
After we've captured the music, we have[n]to "reach the theater entrance within 46[n]steps."
Also, make sure not to use a Goho-M or a[n]Goba-K.

[msg MSG_002_2 [Fuuka]]
If we fail, we have to do it all over[n]again, so we need to be careful.

[msg MSG_003 [Ann]]
Okay... Then let's head out and find[n]that music.
