What promised to be an action-packed[n]adventure turned out to be a[n]heartrending romance...
I began to think my tears would never[n]cease during those last five minutes.
Now then, this is your reward.

[msg MSG_001 [Teddie]]
Grraaaaahhh...!

[msg MSG_002 [Morgana]]
Mrowwwww...!

[msg MSG_003 [Kanji]]
Man, they've been like that since we got[n]back.
You guys all right? You look like you're[n]gonna go all Shadow on us.

[sel SEL_004 top]
This happens all the time.
Let's leave them be.
Don't be jealous.

[msg MSG_005 [Ryuji]]
I dunno... This looks worse than normal.

[msg MSG_006 [P4 Hero]]
Yeah, it's out of our hands at this[n]point.

[msg MSG_007 [Morgana]]
......

[msg MSG_008 [Teddie]]
......

[msg MSG_009 [Ann]]
Hey! You made it even worse!

[msg MSG_010 [Morgana]]
Ngh... I can't accept this. I won't[n]accept this!
That dog may have won the contest, but[n]I'm the one who gets to be at Lady Ann's[n]side!

[msg MSG_011 [Teddie]]
What!? The title of number one belongs[n]to me!

[sel SEL_012 top]
Enough fighting.
You'll just have to duke it out.

[msg MSG_013 [Morgana]]
Stay out of it! This has been a long[n]time coming!

[msg MSG_014 [Ann]]
Whaâ€•!? Don't encourage them!

[msg MSG_015 [Morgana]]
Sorry, Lady Ann, but this has been a[n]long time coming!
Let's go, Teddie!

[msg MSG_016 [Teddie]]
Now you're talking! Take this! Quick[n]Draw Bear Paw!

[msg MSG_017 [Morgana]]
Nyanyanyanyanya!

[msg MSG_018 [Teddie]]
Rahrahrahrahrah!

[msg MSG_019 [Aigis]]
Neither of them seem to have arms long[n]enough to reach the other.

[msg MSG_020 [Makoto]]
This is embarrassing...

[msg MSG_021 [Akihiko]]
But it means a lot to both of them. Let[n]them go at it for a bit.

[msg MSG_022 [P4 Hero]]
Yeah. Sometimes a friendship doesn't[n]really begin until you've traded a punch[n]or two.

[msg MSG_023 [Teddie]]
Rrrrah!

[msg MSG_024 [Morgana]]
Nnnyah!

[msg MSG_025 [Morgana]]
*pant pant* Not bad, for a bear...

[msg MSG_026 [Teddie]]
You've got a pretty good pair of paws[n]yourself...

[msg MSG_027 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_028 [Morgana]]
Koromaru?

[msg MSG_029 [Koromaru]]
Arf, arf!

[msg MSG_030 [Aigis]]
"I may have been the one to find the[n]treasure, but we only made it to the end[n]because we worked together."
...So says Koromaru-san.

[msg MSG_031 [Ann]]
Don't you see? You don't need to decide[n]who's number one.
You're both valued members of our team.
You too, Koro-chan.

[msg MSG_032 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_033 [Morgana]]
Lady Ann...
Sorry. I guess I got a little too heated[n]there...

[msg MSG_034 [Teddie]]
Yeah, I need to calm down too... Sorry.

[sel SEL_035 top]
Let's all get along.
We're counting on you guys.

[msg MSG_036 [Morgana]]
I'll be sure to make up for all the[n]trouble I caused next time.

[msg MSG_037 [Teddie]]
Yeah, me too!
If all of us mascots worked together,[n]we'd be unstoppable...
Let this mark the bear-ginning of the[n]great mascot alliance!

[msg MSG_038 [Koromaru]]
Awooo!

[msg MSG_039 [Morgana]]
Yeah! ...Wait, I'm not a mascot!
