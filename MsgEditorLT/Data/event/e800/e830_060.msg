That looks like the finish! We did it![n]We made it to the end!

[msg MSG_001 [Junpei]]
Whew, that took forever. All that[n]bouncing around's got me beat.
So anyway, what was that "GROW" thing[n]supposed to mean?

[msg MSG_002 [Yukari]]
Unbelievable. You came all this way[n]without knowing what that meant?

[msg MSG_003 [Junpei]]
Huh? Wait, don't tell me everyone else[n]figured it out!?

[sel SEL_004 top]
They're colors.
It's an acronym.

[msg MSG_005 [Akechi]]
That's right. Each letter in GROW is an[n]abbreviation for one of the warp point[n]colors.
Green, red, orange, and white. If you[n]take the first letter of each of these[n]colors, they spell...
"GROW."
So the paper was telling us to use the[n]green, red, orange, and white warp[n]points in that order.

[msg MSG_006 [Naoto]]
I noticed it once we picked up the paper[n]and saw that the warp points were[n]color-coded.
As far as puzzles go, this is a fairly[n]popular variant.

[msg MSG_007 [Ann]]
O-Oh, right. Totally by-the-book, of[n]course!

[msg MSG_008 [Ryuji]]
Y-Yeah! Psh, this is totally amateur[n]hour, right?

[msg MSG_009 [Morgana]]
...You guys had no idea, did you.

[msg MSG_010 [P4 Hero]]
Still, I think "GROW" is pretty[n]appropriate.
After all, we've all grown a little from[n]what we went through, right?

[msg MSG_011 [Yosuke]]
Man, I dunno how you say that kinda[n]stuff with a straight face... Guess[n]that's why you're my partner.

[msg MSG_012 [Rise]]
Anyhow, mission complete! Let's head[n]back and report in!
