[msg MSG_000 [Elizabeth]]
Thanks to you, I was able to get a[n]glimpse of the city's nightlife.
I appreciate your hard work. Here is[n]your reward.

[msg MSG_001 [Junpei]]
Well, we finished our mission, but it[n]still feels like there's somethin'[n]missing...

[msg MSG_002 [Teddie]]
We were so close to finally experiencing[n]the thrill of the adult world...
But one of these days, I'll be able to[n]keep up with our two masters of the[n]night!

[msg MSG_003 [Yosuke]]
I thought [f 6 1 12 0 0 0] was your Sensei. You[n]cheating on him?

[msg MSG_004 [Teddie]]
Of course not! Sensei's on a whole[n]'nother level! He is bright like the[n]sun!
But those two are as bewitching as[n]starlight and moonlight. So[n]mysterious...
If only I could be so cool!

[msg MSG_005 [Yosuke]]
Real smooth talker, this one...
But yeah, they do have something about[n]'em.

[msg MSG_006 [Ken]]
-san is really mature for his age, but[n]it looks like you are too, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]-san.
You know so many people and places we[n]don't.

[sel SEL_007 top]
Not really.
I can show you the ropes.

[msg MSG_008 [Yusuke]]
It's hard to believe he came to Tokyo[n]only half a year ago.
Watching [f 6 1 30 0 0 0] makes me feel like I[n]should get out more often.

[msg MSG_009 [Ken]]
Huh? Really?

[msg MSG_010 [Ryuji]]
Yo, better be careful. Keep him out too[n]late, and you'll get rolled by the[n]police again.

[msg MSG_011 [P3 Hero]]
*chuckle* You really are amazing,.

[msg MSG_012 [Junpei]]
Hey, now. You're pretty cool yourself.
I'm kinda jealous. Not even Junpei, Ace[n]Detective has people skills like you[n]guys do.

[msg MSG_013 [P3 Hero]]
I see...
I had a feeling I'd connect with you[n]somehow. Guess now I know why.
It's nice to know you have my back.

[sel SEL_014 top]
Feeling's mutual.
We're in this together.

[msg MSG_015 [P3 Hero]]
Yeah. Let's keep it going.

[msg MSG_016 [Teddie]]
Ohh! Would you look at that! A new[n]friendship is born between the two[n]nightlife gurus!
I say we all go out and celebrate!

[msg MSG_017 [Junpei]]
Yeah, let's start back up on the road to[n]adulthood...

[msg MSG_018 [Mitsuru]]
Oh? You're going to run off again?

[msg MSG_019 [Makoto]]
Haven't you guys learned your lesson?

[msg MSG_020 [Junpei]]
Uhâ€•Well... We, uh... Uhh...

[msg MSG_021 [Teddie]]
Help us!

[sel SEL_022 top]
......
Did you hear something?

[msg MSG_023 [P3 Hero]]
......

[msg MSG_024 [P3 Hero]]
Nope.

[msg MSG_025 [Teddie]]
Sheesh, city folk are so meeeaaan!
