All right then... Where should we start[n]looking?
I mean this place is huge, so we don't[n]want to just wander around aimlessly.

[msg MSG_001 [Mitsuru]]
Agreed. We were told that the "flowers"[n]would be a clue. So let's start with[n]them.

[msg MSG_002 [P3 Hero]]
Well, except there are "flowers"[n]everywhere you look.

[msg MSG_003 [Ryuji]]
Can you sense anything, Hikari? Even[n]just a vague direction?

[msg MSG_004 [Hikari]]
Um... Sorry, I don't feel anything...

[msg MSG_005 [???]]
Hey hey. Have you heard the news?

[msg MSG_006 [???]]
Now, now. You couldn't possibly be[n]talking about the "black thing," right?

[msg MSG_007 [???]]
Hahaha... Yes, I heard those rumors! I[n]heard all about the "black thing" that[n]girl was carrying, yes sirree!

[msg MSG_008 [???]]
Hohoho... Let me assure you, it is I who[n]knows all about the "black thing" the[n]girl was carrying!

[msg MSG_009 [P4 Hero]]
Those voices! Where are they coming[n]from?

[msg MSG_010 [Yosuke]]
We've gotta find out!
