[msg MSG_000 [Futaba]]
We'll save a lot of time if we cut[n]through here. Only thing is...

[msg MSG_001 [Koromaru]]
Grrr...

[msg MSG_002 [Ann]]
Koro-chan looks tense...

[msg MSG_003 [Teddie]]
My nose itches. This smell must be...

[msg MSG_004 [Morgana]]
Yeah, it's an FOE. My whiskers have been[n]on edge for a while now.

[msg MSG_005 [Kanji]]
Wow, their senses are somethin' else...

[msg MSG_006 [Teddie]]
Hmph, what's another FOE at this point!?[n]We'll just tip-toe around it!
Ready or not, here comes Teddie!

[msg MSG_007 [Fuuka]]
W-Wait!

[msg MSG_008 [Teddie]]
Huh?

[msg MSG_009 [Fuuka]]
The path up ahead is actually quite[n]narrow. There's not enough space to go[n]around.

[msg MSG_010 [Futaba]]
Yeah, that thing's not letting anyone[n]through.
If we wanna take this shortcut, we're[n]gonna have to fight.

[msg MSG_011 [Mitsuru]]
That's a difficult choice to make.[n]Passing through here would shorten our[n]trip considerably.

[msg MSG_012 [Futaba]]
Well, at our current strength, it's not[n]exactly invincible.
So, what's the plan, Joker?

[sel SEL_013 top]
We're going in.
Let's turn back.
Let me think.

[msg MSG_014 [Teddie]]
Wow, you're just as crazy as Sensei.

[msg MSG_015 [Morgana]]
You gonna do it, Joker?
Heh, okay then, I'm with you.

[msg MSG_016 [Ann]]
Then, let's go!

[msg MSG_017 [Teddie]]
Oh, we're not gonna go for it?

[msg MSG_018 [Morgana]]
There're other paths we can take. No[n]need for any unnecessary risks here.

[msg MSG_019 [Ann]]
Then, do you want to head back?

[msg MSG_020 [Morgana]]
Sure, pick whichever seems easier to[n]you. I'm with you, no matter what!
