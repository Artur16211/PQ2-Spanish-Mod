This is my sanctuary... Hidden from all.

[msg MSG_001 [Marie]]
Forever unseen by you, as further into love I[n]fall. It is here, in this... in this... Um. I[n]need to say what the sanctuary is!

[sel SEL_002 top]
A place to sleep, and dream...
Just your own room.
A shrine.

[msg MSG_003 [Marie]]
A place to sleep and dream? Like dream[n]of the beloved?
Yes, you can covet the sweet, forbidden[n]fruit, and dreaming of it makes wherever[n]you sleep your sanctuary...

[msg MSG_004 [Marie]]
Sure, that's the idea. But even more[n]than your room, a true sanctuary is[n]impossible for anyone else to enter.
The place that's physically impossible[n]for anyone else to enter is your dreams![n]So the sanctuary is one's bed...

[msg MSG_005 [Marie]]
That's close. A shrine is a special place, but[n]I need a place where only I can enter. Like...[n]my dreams! In my own bed!
Yes, you can covet the sweet, forbidden[n]fruit, and dreaming of it makes wherever[n]you sleep your sanctuary...

Hey, she's on a roll.

[msg MSG_007 [Marie]]
When I'm with you, I masquerade as an[n]angel even as envy burns within me...
I am but an innocent who can't help her[n]sinful love... You know, I think this is[n]my greatest masterpiece yet...

[sel SEL_008 top]
That was true pathos.
How inspirational.

[msg MSG_009 [Marie]]
GYAAAAAAAH! W-W-Why were you listening[n]to me!?

[msg MSG_010 [Yusuke]]
Well, you were just saying it all out[n]loud...
And besides, do you really want to deny[n]the world your art? Your beautiful words[n]that make one weak in the knees?

[msg MSG_011 [Marie]]
Flattery's not gonna get you anywhere![n]...You really think it's beautiful?

[msg MSG_012 [Marie]]
I mean, I don't care! C'mon, let's go[n]back, already. I'm tired.

[msg MSG_013 [P4 Hero]]
*chuckle* Sure, let's go.
