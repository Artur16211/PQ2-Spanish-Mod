Another Shadow down! Just one more to[n]go!

[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
Heh, this is nothin' compared to[n]stealin' Treasure!

[msg MSG_002 [Ken]]
Oh, so what happens to a person once you[n]steal their Treasure?

[sel SEL_003 top]
They have a change of heart.
They turn themselves in.
They burst into tears.

[msg MSG_004 [Ann]]
That only happens because they feel[n]guilty for what they've done.

[msg MSG_005 [Morgana]]
It's because their warped desires[n]disappear along with their Palace.
Their conscience gives way to their[n]guilt, so they end up confessing[n]everything.

[msg MSG_006 [Ken]]
So that's a change of heart... It's[n]pretty scary when you think about it.

[msg MSG_007 [Ryuji]]
That's why we all agree on our target[n]before making a move. We don't wanna[n]misuse that power.

[msg MSG_008 [Ken]]
Misuse...

[msg MSG_009 [Ann]]
...Ken-kun?

[msg MSG_010 [Ken]]
Oh, sorry. I'm just learning a lot, is[n]all.

[msg MSG_011 [Morgana]]
We'll continue the lesson later. Let's[n]get going for now.

[msg MSG_012 [Ken]]
R-Right!
