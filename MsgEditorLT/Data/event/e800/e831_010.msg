[msg MSG_000 [Elizabeth]]
I would like to notify you that a new[n]special screening has been added.
Though this one may be a little too[n]suggestive for some...

[msg MSG_001 [Teddie]]
...Hm!? My nose tells me we're in for[n]something... mature[f 0 1 1]!

[msg MSG_002 [Elizabeth]]
I'd like for you to locate a secret hot[n]spot in Ciudad Kamo.
There, men and women party all nightâ€•[n]rustling and tussling, giving in to[n]their earthly desires...

[msg MSG_003 [Yusuke]]
Rustling and tussling...?

[msg MSG_004 [Kanji]]
A secret hot spot?

[msg MSG_005 [Yosuke]]
Whoa, whoa... That sounds kinda[n]dangerous.

[sel SEL_006 top]
You don't want to go?
You can stay here.

[msg MSG_007 [Yosuke]]
I never said that. Actually, I'm kinda[n]curious...

[msg MSG_008 [Kanji]]
I wonder why, Senpai...

[msg MSG_009 [Yosuke]]
Shut it!

[msg MSG_010 [Akechi]]
A nighttime hot spot... She probably[n]means...

[sel SEL_011 top]
An arcade?
A nightclub.
A bath house.

[msg MSG_012 [Yosuke]]
Well, arcades ARE a place to have fun...

[msg MSG_013 [Naoto]]
But they're not exactly adult hot spots,[n]are they?
Elizabeth is most likely referring to a[n]nightclub.

[msg MSG_014 [P4 Hero]]
You mean where macho guys go to get all[n]steamy...?

[msg MSG_015 [Kanji]]
Why you lookin' at me!?

[msg MSG_016 [Naoto]]
I'm not sure what you mean, but[n]Elizabeth is most likely referring to a[n]nightclub.

[msg MSG_017 [Elizabeth]]
That is correct.
There are many popular and exclusive[n]nightclubs in Ciudad Kamo accessible only[n]to VIPs.

[msg MSG_018 [Ann]]
A nightclub, huh...?

[msg MSG_019 [Makoto]]
I don't like the sound of that.

[msg MSG_020 [P3 Hero]]
Oh, no?

[msg MSG_021 [Yosuke]]
"Oh, no?"... You go to clubs often or[n]something?

[msg MSG_022 [Teddie]]
*whistle* You're a bad boy! We'll leave[n]this to you, then!

[sel SEL_023 top]
We're counting on you.
I'm a night owl too.

[msg MSG_024 [Ryuji]]
Ain't you been goin' to that club in[n]Shinjuku...?

[msg MSG_025 [Ryuji]]
That's right. You're still goin' to that[n]club in Shinjuku, aren't you...?

[msg MSG_026 [Teddie]]
What!? We got another bad boy here!

[msg MSG_027 [Junpei]]
Well, it looks like we've got a couple[n]of veterans here. This looks like a job[n]for us guys.

[msg MSG_028 [Ann]]
Uh... Us guys?

[msg MSG_029 [Junpei]]
It's too dangerous for the girls to walk[n]around the city at night, right?
Better to let us take the lead on this.

[msg MSG_030 [Yukari]]
...What are you up to, Junpei?

[msg MSG_031 [Junpei]]
N-Nothing. Just tryna be a gentleman...

[msg MSG_032 [P3 Hero]]
I don't think it's that dangerous...

[msg MSG_033 [Junpei]]
We're going to an adult hangout, right?[n]Maybe we can have some "adult fun"...

[msg MSG_034 [Fuuka]]
Junpei-kun?

[msg MSG_035 [Junpei]]
Oh, nothing, nothing! Just sayin' we'll[n]take care of it.

[sel SEL_036 top]
We got this.
You can trust us.

[msg MSG_038 [Mitsuru]]
Hm... Well, if they insist, then I[n]suppose we'll leave it to them.

[msg MSG_039 [Yukari]]
Are you sure?

[msg MSG_040 [Mitsuru]]
They just have to find the nightclub.[n]What's the worst that could happen?

[msg MSG_041 [Junpei]]
Well said, Senpai! All right, let's do[n]this!

[msg MSG_042 [Elizabeth]]
Very well. It's in the bad boys' hands[n]now.
