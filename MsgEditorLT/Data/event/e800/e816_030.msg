It amazes me that a gate of this size[n]moves so effortlessly.
It's likely the controls for it are far[n]beyond our current level of technology.

[msg MSG_001 [Yukiko]]
Hehe, you seem more talkative than[n]usual, Naoto-kun.

[msg MSG_002 [Yosuke]]
It's not exactly machinery, but she does[n]like those secret bases with doors that[n]go "Nhreeeeâ€•CRUSH!"

[msg MSG_003 [Naoto]]
Th-That's... It's kind of[n]embarrassing...

[msg MSG_004 [Fuuka]]
Secret bases? You mean like a lab or a[n]research institute!?

[msg MSG_005 [Naoto]]
Huh? U-Um... Yes.

[sel SEL_006 top]
That's cool.
I'd like to see that.

[msg MSG_007 [Naoto]]
No, it was just a labyrinth my heart[n]created, and, besides, it's gone now...

[msg MSG_008 [Yusuke]]
A secret base created by one's heart[n]that's neither a Palace nor Mementos...
How very intriguing. If only I'd been[n]able to see it with my own eyes!

[msg MSG_009 [Koromaru]]
Arf, arf!

[msg MSG_010 [Yukiko]]
Your secret lab sure is popular,[n]Naoto-kun.

[msg MSG_011 [Naoto]]
......
I feel sort of foolish about being[n]embarrassed earlier.
...Ah, we need to keep searching for[n]that container.
It should be just a little further.[n]Let's keep going.
