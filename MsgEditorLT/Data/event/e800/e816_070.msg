I appreciate you completing the special[n]screening for my worthless brother.
From now on, please feel free to order[n]him around however you like.

[msg MSG_001 [Yosuke]]
Haha... I feel bad about how he's[n]treated as is...

[msg MSG_002 [Theodore]]
Thank you for bringing the "Futuristic[n]Gizmo."
It was just as enthralling as I[n]expected. I'm beginning to feel quite[n]motivated...!

[msg MSG_003 [P3 Fem Protag]]
*giggle* You seem pretty excited, Theo.[n]I hope you'll continue to lend us your[n]assistance.
That said, I didn't know you were so[n]into technology.

[msg MSG_004 [Theodore]]
Well, it wasn't necessarily the device[n]itself, I actually just wanted to hold[n]it.
As I thought, it's room temperature.

[msg MSG_005 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Huh? That's all you wanted?

[msg MSG_006 [Theodore]]
I was able to feed my curiosity, though[n]I didn't think it would be this[n]comforting.

[sel SEL_007 top]
Good for you.
I don't get it.

[msg MSG_008 [Theodore]]
Yes, and it's all thanks to everyone[n]here.
I'm now refreshed and ready to resume my[n]duties.

[msg MSG_009 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Y-You don't have any questions or[n]anything? You're really something,-kun.

[msg MSG_010 [P3 Fem Protag]]
S-Sorry. Theo has this ability where he[n]can tell the exact temperature of[n]something just by touching it...
I guess that doesn't make things any[n]clearer... Anyway, he's just a little[n]odd. Ahaha...

[msg MSG_011 [Futaba]]
Either way, Theodore's ready for[n]anything. Guess we reached the true[n]ending.
Wait a sec...

[msg MSG_012 [Fuuka]]
The wiring and everything... It really[n]is amazing.
I couldn't believe my eyes. To think[n]someone would have an idea like this.

[msg MSG_013 [Naoto]]
Right, but it could very well become a[n]reality in the near future.
This device is currently being developed[n]in some countries.

[msg MSG_014 [Yusuke]]
From an artist's perspective, this line[n]of symmetry is just...

[msg MSG_015 [Koromaru]]
Woof! Woof!

[msg MSG_016 [Futaba]]
You guys are still at it? That machine[n]really is something!
