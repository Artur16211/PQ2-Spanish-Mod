[msg MSG_000 [Elizabeth]]
Welcome to the Velvet Room.
Hmhm... I must say, donning the uniform[n]has done wonders to prepare my mind.

[msg MSG_001 [P3 Hero]]
Elizabeth... You're getting serious.

[msg MSG_002 [Elizabeth]]
Yes. Naturally.
I can only thank fate for bringing us[n]together. With gratitude, I shall make[n]this a fierce bout indeed.

[msg MSG_003 [P3 Fem Protag]]
What an immense presence... I've never[n]seen her like this...!

[msg MSG_004 [Elizabeth]]
I am she who governs power.
If you would overcome me, then show me[n]the full scope of your strength.

[msg MSG_005 [P4 Hero]]
Yeah. We're going to win this.

[msg MSG_006 [Elizabeth]]
Should you succeed, I know without a[n]doubt that you shall discover new[n]possibilities within yourselves.

[sel SEL_007 top]
We'll use all our power.
Go easy on us.

[msg MSG_008 [Elizabeth]]
*chuckle* I can ask for nothing more.

[msg MSG_009 [Elizabeth]]
*chuckle* Unfortunately, I lack the[n]talent for such restraint.

[msg MSG_010 [Elizabeth]]
Truly, I cannot remember feeling such[n]elation... not since I first began[n]serving my master.
Somehow, you bearers of potential have[n]defied time and space, and you now stand[n]shoulder-to-shoulder.

[msg MSG_010_1 [Elizabeth]]
I shall give you an honorable fight. A[n]battle befitting one who governs power.

[msg MSG_010_2 [Elizabeth]]
Now then... here I come!

[msg MSG_011 [Elizabeth]]
Welcome back. Now, let the ringside bell[n]ring. Our rematch begins now.

[msg MSG_011_1 [Elizabeth]]
Come on, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]! If you can't do it, no[n]one can! The revenge match starts now!
