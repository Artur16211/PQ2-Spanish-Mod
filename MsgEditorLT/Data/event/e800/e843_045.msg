So we went right... and that means you[n]pushed the guy onto the tracks.
I guess you stopped the cart, but you[n]stone-cold killed a guy to do it.

[msg MSG_001 [Ann]]
But, I mean... this way, we saved five[n]people!
U-Um... Somehow, that doesn't really[n]make me feel better...

[msg MSG_002 [Kanji]]
Arrrgh! What the hell is this!?
Screw all these carts and tracks and[n]switches! I'm gonna stop the damn thing[n]myself!

[msg MSG_003 [Akechi]]
Calm down, Tatsumi-kun. This is all a[n]hypothetical scenario.

[msg MSG_004 [Mitsuru]]
Still, it makes you think.
Just like before, it's a question of[n]sacrificing one life to save five.
However, having to directly push a man[n]to his death makes it feel a bit less...[n]passive.

[msg MSG_005 [Akechi]]
I imagine that's the point. Whoever[n]prepared this wanted us to reflect on[n]that.
When faced with a difficult choice, what[n]would go through our minds, and what[n]would we do...?

[msg MSG_006 [Morgana]]
That kinda creeps me out... It's like[n]they're trying to see into the depths of[n]our hearts.
Still, maybe thinking about these things[n]is what makes us human.

[msg MSG_007 [Makoto]]
At any rate, we've answered both[n]questions. Shall we make our way to the[n]end?

[msg MSG_008 [Shinjiro]]
So we went left... That means you didn't[n]push the guy onto the tracks.
Which means it kept going, and hit the[n]five workers... Sounds pretty messy.

[msg MSG_009 [Akihiko]]
Still, at least the big guy gets to[n]survive.
Otherwise, we would've had to push him[n]onto the tracks ourselves...
I don't know if I could have done it.[n]Even if it'd have saved five people.

[msg MSG_010 [Teddie]]
If Kanji were there, he could just jump[n]in front of the cart and smack it away!

[msg MSG_011 [Yosuke]]
Yeah. He's so tough, that cart wouldn't[n]budge him at all.

[msg MSG_012 [Kanji]]
Hell yeah! All I need is one punch to[n]send it flying!

[msg MSG_013 [Naoto]]
I'm not sure the workers would be any[n]better off in that case...

[msg MSG_014 [Mitsuru]]
All joking aside, it is strange.
Just like before, it's a question of[n]sacrificing one life to save five.
However, having to directly push a man[n]to his death makes it feel a bit less...[n]passive.

[msg MSG_015 [Akechi]]
