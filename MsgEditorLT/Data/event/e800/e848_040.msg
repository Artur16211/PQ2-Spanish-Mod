[msg MSG_000 [Elizabeth]]
Fine work. You've emerged victorious[n]from a most vicious fight! I can only[n]give you a standing ovation.
And just as I had predicted, you've[n]acquired another piece of film.

[msg MSG_001 [P4 Hero]]
But it's definitely seen better days.

[msg MSG_001_1 [P4 Hero]]
If it's just like the other one, then we[n]just have to display our power to[n]activate it, right?

[msg MSG_002 [Makoto]]
Does that mean we'll be fighting[n]Theodore again...?

[sel SEL_003 top]
Bring it on.
Gotta brace myself...

[msg MSG_004 [Elizabeth]]
Hmhm... Spoken like a truly hotblooded[n]rapscallion.

[msg MSG_004_1 [Elizabeth]]
By all means... or so I would say, but[n]the rules must be observed.

[msg MSG_005 [Elizabeth]]
My, there's no need to be so anxious.
After all, there are rules that must be[n]observed. In the meantime, you may[n]prepare mentally and physically.

[msg MSG_006 [Elizabeth]]
All that aside, you have satisfied the[n]request. The Shadow is slain.

[msg MSG_006_1 [Elizabeth]]
And so you are owed an appropriate[n]reward. [f 6 1 13 0 0 0] gave us a fine[n]performance indeed.
Once you are fully prepared to display[n]your power, come speak to me again, just[n]like before.

[msg MSG_007 [Morgana]]
There's no telling who we'll be up[n]against this time. Whoever it is, it[n]won't be easy.

[msg MSG_007_1 [Morgana]]
We'll take her challenge once we've[n]gotten ourselves ready. It'll be a[n]serious fight, that's for sure.
