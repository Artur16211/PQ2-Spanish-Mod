Dammit, a dead end.
Man, I knew we were supposed to take[n]that right turn back there... Ugh,[n]backtracking is such a pain.

[msg MSG_001 [Futaba]]
Quit complaining, Skull. What's wrong[n]with taking the scenic route?

[msg MSG_002 [Ann]]
Yeah! Whenever you get lost in the city,[n]you always find some new shop you never[n]noticed before!

[msg MSG_003 [Naoto]]
And something similar might happen[n]within movies, I suppose.
What we first perceive as an unnecessary[n]detour may lead to something useful.
And the extra travel gives us an[n]opportunity to gain more combat[n]experience, so it's not all bad.

[msg MSG_004 [Ryuji]]
Well, I guess we'd never have gotten[n]this far without a couple wrong turns[n]along the way...
Better turn around, anyway. Let's go,[n]Joker.

A new special screening: "A Look Inward"[n]has been added to the box office.
