There's a paper on the ground with[n]something written on it...

[msg MSG_001]
A calling card...!?
"Sir [f 6 1 31 0 0 0] and team, fiends[n]that have robbed us of our modest[n]happiness."
"You were corrupted by avarice, and[n]betrayed our trust. We were kind to you,[n]yet you repaid our efforts in sin."
"You shall face your due justice in the[n]Velvet Room."
"For more details, come to the box[n]office. From the avengers in blue,[n]defenders of movies and hot dogs."

...?
I guess I should talk to Elizabeth about[n]this at the box office...
