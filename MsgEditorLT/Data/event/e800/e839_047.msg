[msg MSG_000 [Junpei]]
Alrighty! Now that we've made it through[n]the door, let's find the house.
Wait a minute... There are a bunch of[n]houses here! How're we supposed to know[n]which one it is?

[msg MSG_001 [Yosuke]]
It's at the end of a blocked path. Then[n]again, we could just search them all and[n]use the process of elimination.
Of course, I forgot there are scary[n]Shadows waiting for us. So... don't[n]freak out, anyone.

[msg MSG_002 [Ryuji]]
Tsh, who do you think I am? Don't[n]undersell the charge commander of the[n]Phantom Thieves!

[msg MSG_003 [Hikari]]
...

[msg MSG_004 [Junpei]]
What's wrong, Hikari-chan? You nervous?
Don't be. Ace Junpei's got you covered.[n]Those Shadows don't have a prayer!

[msg MSG_005 [Hikari]]
I was just wondering, how do you all[n]stay so strong?
You're always so confident, no matter[n]what enemies you face, no matter how[n]scary they are...

[msg MSG_006 [Ryuji]]
You know, for me, I never really thought[n]about it.
I guess... I just figure if I go at them[n]with everything I got, then... well, my[n]friends will back me up somehow.
Seems like a rare thing, don't it? Plus,[n]we've got Joker. You know how amazing he[n]is, right?

[msg MSG_007 [Yosuke]]
I know what you mean about how rare it[n]is. Seriously, once I teamed up with my[n]partner here, I felt unbeatable.
But that's exactly why I fight so hard.[n]I don't wanna drag him down.

[msg MSG_008 [Ryuji]]
Got that right. I can't be embarrassing[n]myself in front of my leader, ya know?

[msg MSG_009 [Junpei]]
Hell, I can't think of anyone that makes[n]me feel that way except [f 6 1 16 0 0].

[msg MSG_010 [Hikari]]
You all really trust your leaders.[n]*chuckle* I'm kind of jealous.
You're not just ordinary friends. You[n]love each other so much that you all[n]want to stand together as equals.

[msg MSG_011 [Yosuke]]
L-Love!?
I mean, you're not wrong, but... did you[n]have to phrase it in such an[n]embarrassing way?

[msg MSG_012 [Junpei]]
Yeah, how about calling it... a fiery[n]friendship among men!

[msg MSG_013 [Ryuji]]
Let's just not bring this up to the[n]others, agreed?

[msg MSG_014 [Hikari]]
Hehe, sure. I won't tell anyone.

[msg MSG_015 [Chie]]
Do you think they know that we can hear[n]everything they're saying?

[msg MSG_016 [Ann]]
No, they don't realize how loud their[n]voices are, the goofballs.
But how does it make you feel, what[n]they're saying?

[sel SEL_017 top]
It's a little embarrassing.
It's no big deal...
I love them.

[msg MSG_018 [P3 Hero]]
Haha. Yeah, it kind of is. It makes me[n]glad, though.

[msg MSG_019 [Makoto]]
*giggle* You're trying to deflect, but[n]your face looks pretty happy.

[msg MSG_020 [P3 Hero]]
Well, it is kind of embarrassing to[n]hear. Who's used to talking about that[n]stuff?

[msg MSG_021 [Ann]]
Whoa! Uh, maybe you should be saying[n]that to them, not me!

[msg MSG_022 [P3 Hero]]
Haha, I think it's really nice, in the[n]end.

[msg MSG_023 [P4 Hero]]
We better not let all that goodwill go[n]to waste, that's all I can say!
Especially when the house we're looking[n]for is so close. Let's stay sharp out[n]there.
