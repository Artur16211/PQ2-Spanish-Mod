Oh, is this what we're looking for? The,[n]uh... whatchamacallit thingy?

[msg MSG_002 [Junpei]]
Don't you think it's kinda important to[n]know the name of the thing we're looking[n]for!?

[msg MSG_003 [Aigis]]
It is called a motor driver, and, yes,[n]this does seem to be what we were[n]searching for.
It doesn't appear to be damaged. All that is[n]left is to take this to the robot in need and[n]we can begin the repairs.

[msg MSG_004 [Ken]]
That's great news! Let's head back right[n]away!
