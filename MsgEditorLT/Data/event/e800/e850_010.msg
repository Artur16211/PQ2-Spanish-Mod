Well! It feels as though we're finally[n]approaching the grand finale to all[n]these special screenings.
Thinking back, the countless shows[n]you've been a part of were all truly[n]spectacular in their own ways.

[msg MSG_001 [Hikari]]
Yeah... I always look forward to them[n]now, since I get to see different sides[n]to everyone.
They're all so memorable... like great[n]movies should be.

[msg MSG_002 [Elizabeth]]
It's about time you take a break. Enjoy[n]a screening of the special sort.

[msg MSG_002_1 [Elizabeth]]
It would seem a deadly Shadow has[n]appeared in the depths of Hikari's[n]movie.
Please slay it, and thus prove your[n]strength.

[sel SEL_003 top]
Let's do this.
Again? Seriously?

[msg MSG_004 [Akihiko]]
Yeah, we'll take them on. It's a perfect[n]opportunity to train ourselves even[n]harder.

[msg MSG_005 [Mitsuru]]
Come now, there's no sense refusing.[n]Serious battles like these are valuable[n]opportunities for us.

[msg MSG_006 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Yeah, Senpai's right! We've got a lot[n]more fighting ahead of us, after all.

[msg MSG_007 [Junpei]]
So, what's the deets? If this is just[n]like usual, it's gonna have a specific[n]cast, right?

[msg MSG_008 [Elizabeth]]
Ah yes, [f 6 1 27 0 0 0].
According to the ticket, you appear to[n]be the specified cast member for this[n]screening.

[msg MSG_009 [P3 Fem Protag]]
W-Wait, me!?

[msg MSG_010 [Elizabeth]]
Indeed so. Please make certain that you[n]participate in this battle,.

[msg MSG_011 [Junpei]]
You got this, leading lady!

[msg MSG_011_1 [Junpei]]
Don't worry. There's no way you can[n]lose! You got me on your side, and I'm[n]the biggest superstar here!

[msg MSG_012 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hee hee... Thanks, Junpei, but I won't[n]expect any big heroics.

[msg MSG_013 [Junpei]]
H-Hey now, I could be a hero if I[n]wanted!

[msg MSG_014 [Yukari]]
When you say it like that, you sound[n]like even more of a loser.

[msg MSG_015 [Elizabeth]]
Well then, everyone. I invite you to[n]display your power to your hearts'[n]content.
And when you've accomplished this deed[n]with your usual aplomb...

[msg MSG_015_1 [Elizabeth]]
Finally, my time will come...! Oh, the[n]thrill of it! My heart is pounding!

[msg MSG_016 [P3 Fem Protag]]
She seems kinda distracted, so... we'd[n]better focus on beating that enemy down[n]there.

[msg MSG_016_1 [P3 Fem Protag]]
She said it was in the depths of[n]Hikari-chan's movie, right? Once we're[n]all set, let's get going!
