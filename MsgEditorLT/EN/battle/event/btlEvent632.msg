Well then. It seems the time for[n]conversation is over.
Now, you can only focus on wielding your[n]power to its fullest extent.

[msg MSG_010 [Elizabeth]]
I should warn you, I'm no stranger to[n]this sort of roughhousing...
Ah, this...? No, it's nothing.
You needn't worry about me... I advise[n]you come at me as if you aim to kill.

[msg MSG_020 [Elizabeth]]
This is going magnificently. I daresay[n]I'm getting a little carried away!

[msg MSG_030 [Elizabeth]]
*chuckle* It seems I was right. Your[n]spirit is remarkable.
However, remember that misjudging a[n]battle, especially this late, would be a[n]disservice to your power.

[msg MSG_040 [Elizabeth]]
Well done. Your power is most excellent[n]indeed...
