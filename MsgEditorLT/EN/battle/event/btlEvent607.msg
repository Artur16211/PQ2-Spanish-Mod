Huh? Good news?

I've gotten a pretty good handle on how[n]to provide backup and use Personas while[n]we're here.
From here on, I'll be helping out too!

Having you for support will be a big[n]help.

[msg MSG_005 [Ann]]
Yeah! We can't wait to see what you can[n]do, Oracle!

Just leave it to me! I hope you're[n]excited!
