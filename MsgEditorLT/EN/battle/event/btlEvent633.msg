[msg MSG_000 [Caroline]]
Hahaha! We don't need any help to take[n]you prisoners down!

[msg MSG_001 [Justine]]
You should feel honored, Inmate.

[msg MSG_010 [Caroline]]
Hmph. Guess we went a little too easy on[n]them.

[msg MSG_011 [Justine]]
...Then playtime is officially over.

[msg MSG_020 [Caroline]]
Ngh... We're not done with you yet!

[msg MSG_021 [Margaret]]
My, I can't bear to watch this any[n]longer.

[msg MSG_022 [Justine]]
...What is the meaning of this? We can[n]still fight.

[msg MSG_023 [Margaret]]
*chuckle* Don't misunderstand me. There[n]is a right and proper way to fight these[n]battles.
I will set an example for all of you!

[msg MSG_030 [Margaret]]
Have you really gained so much power...?[n]I never expected this...
Hmhm... Very well. Then I need hold[n]nothing back anymore!

[msg MSG_031 [Caroline]]
Eek!?

[msg MSG_032 [Caroline]]
...What's with that look, Inmates!? I'm[n]not like I'm scared or anything!

[msg MSG_033 [Justine]]
Caroline, you must concentrate!

[msg MSG_050 [Margaret]]
*chuckle* It's been quite a while since[n]I felt such passion coursing through me.[n]Marvelous indeed.

[msg MSG_051 [Theodore]]
From here on, I shall be stepping in.

[msg MSG_052 [Caroline]]
Wha...!? Don't get in our way!

[msg MSG_053 [Theodore]]
Goodness me, do you really expect to[n]fight in that condition?

[msg MSG_054 [Justine]]
...Perhaps we'd better settle down and[n]accept his help...

[msg MSG_060 [Theodore]]
Ngh... gah...

[msg MSG_061 [Caroline]]
Hah, phew... What's wrong, Theodore!?[n]You were so quick to jump in before!

[msg MSG_062 [Justine]]
Caroline, just look at them. The[n]prisoners are clearly overpowering[n]Theodore.
If we let our guard down, we'll be next[n]to fall.

[msg MSG_063 [Caroline]]
Hmph! I know that!

[msg MSG_070 [Theodore]]

[msg MSG_080 [Theodore]]
Even united, the three of us cannot win[n]against you... Commendable.
...I leave the rest to you, Sister.

[msg MSG_081 [Elizabeth]]
The time has come. I, Elizabeth, shall[n]be your opponent.
...Though I would have preferred that[n]time come a bit sooner.
Now then, will you two be joining me?

[msg MSG_082 [Caroline]]
Of course!

[msg MSG_083 [Elizabeth]]
That's the spirit. Now, here we come!

[msg MSG_090 [Caroline]]
Ha! What's wrong, Elizabeth? You getting[n]tired out?

[msg MSG_091 [Elizabeth]]
Caroline, we shall settle this after[n]school. Bring your lunch money.

[msg MSG_092 [Justine]]
...At least you two seem to have energy[n]to spare...

[msg MSG_093 [Elizabeth]]
*chuckle* Well, we rarely get to enjoy a[n]fight of this caliber.
Take it from me―you need to keep enough[n]composure to enjoy it!

[msg MSG_100 [Elizabeth]]
Well done.

[msg MSG_110 [Justine]]
What a curious feeling... So this is[n]"fun," is it...?

[msg MSG_111 [Caroline]]
Hmph. You gave us a good time, Inmates!

[msg MSG_112 [Elizabeth]]
A perfect victory... I offer you the[n]highest praises, from the depths of my[n]very heart.
