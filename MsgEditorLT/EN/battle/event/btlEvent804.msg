GRUUUUUAAAAH...

[msg MSG_000_5 [Haru]]
He transformed!? Can he really do that?

[msg MSG_000_7 [P4 Hero]]
Ngh... Looks like we're done talking[n]this over.

[msg MSG_000 [Yosuke]]
You've given up all your own thoughts...[n]Is that really how you want to live?

[msg MSG_001 [Yosukesaurus]]
Shut up, shut up! If I don't do this...[n]I... I...

[msg MSG_001_5 [Yosukesaurus]]
I've got no choice... but to take you[n]out!

[msg MSG_002 [Yosuke]]
Dammit, he's gone completely berserk![n]Snap out of it!

[msg MSG_002_5 [P4 Hero]]
Everyone, get ready!

[msg MSG_003 [Yosukesaurus]]
N-Nngh... N-No... I can't...

[msg MSG_004 [Sulky herbivore]]
What? You can't back out of this now...

[msg MSG_005 [Loud herbivore]]
The majority has spoken―or, would you[n]rather get kicked out of the herd?

[msg MSG_006 [Yosukesaurus]]
Ah―No... I don't wanna be kicked out!

[msg MSG_007 [Yosukesaurus]]
Hey, uh... Isn't this far enough?

[msg MSG_008 [Nervous herbivore]]
You can't stop now. This is what we all[n]voted for...

[msg MSG_009 [Sulky herbivore]]
That's right. There's no way a unanimous[n]vote is wrong.

[msg MSG_010 [Yosukesaurus]]
R-Right...? There's nothing else I can[n]do!

[msg MSG_011 [Timid herbivore]]
Uh, hey... If he keeps this up...

[msg MSG_012 [Loud herbivore]]
You wanna stay with the herd, right?[n]Then you'd better prove it!

[msg MSG_013 [Yosukesaurus]]
Aaaaargh! Fine! I'll do it... That's[n]what you want, right!?

[msg MSG_014 [Yosukesaurus]]
GRRRUUUUUUHHHHH...

[msg MSG_015 [Yusuke]]
What the―Something's not right here!

[msg MSG_020 [Yosukesaurus]]
GYAAAAAAAAH!

[msg MSG_021 [Loud herbivore]]
C'mon! Get 'em!

[msg MSG_022 [Sulky herbivore]]
Stop fooling around!

[msg MSG_023 [Nervous herbivore]]
...Do it already!

[msg MSG_025 [Haru]]
It seems like he's only fighting because[n]of the dinosaurs behind him...

[msg MSG_026 [Yosuke]]
Dammit, this is terrible! What are we[n]gonna do!?

[msg MSG_027 [P4 Hero]]
Looks like we'll just have to shut those[n]dinosaurs behind him up...
C'mon, everyone!

[msg MSG_016_5 [Yosuke]]
Alright! We did it!

[msg MSG_017 [Yosukesaurus]]
Se-Seriously? Heheheh... You guys...[n]really are strong...
