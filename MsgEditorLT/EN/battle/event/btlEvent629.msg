Well then, everyone... I, Theodore, will[n]be your opponent.
Allow me to witness your strength[n]firsthand.

[msg MSG_010 [Theodore]]
Hm... I see. You fascinate me almost as[n]much as popcorn.
But this is nowhere near the extent of[n]your power, is it?

[msg MSG_020 [Theodore]]
I do take a certain pride in my[n]strength. And that pride will not allow[n]me to falter so soon.

[msg MSG_030 [Theodore]]
Impressive... Ah, but the compliments[n]can wait until the dust has settled.
Now, allow me to witness the full scope[n]of your power.

[msg MSG_040 [Theodore]]
Magnificent... So this is your power...
I have now witnessed it for myself.
