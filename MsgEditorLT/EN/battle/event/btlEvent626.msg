Tch, they just keep comin'... We'll just[n]take 'em out one at a time!

[msg MSG_002 [Morgana]]
Wait, Skull―I've got a better idea...
Don'tcha think we've gotten used to[n]fighting in this world by now?

[msg MSG_003 [Yusuke]]
Indeed―my movement has become much more[n]fluid than before.

[msg MSG_004 [Morgana]]
But we're forgetting an important part[n]of how the Phantom Thieves fight, yeah?

[msg MSG_005 [Ann]]
Ohhh, you mean Baton Passes!?

[msg MSG_006 [Morgana]]
Correct―impressive, Panther! If we use[n]Baton Pass, we'll gain the advantage!

[msg MSG_007 [Makoto]]
That's right, our fighting style should[n]work for us in this world too.

[msg MSG_008 [Morgana]]
Yep! It's business as usual for us. Let[n]us know when you're ready for one,[n]Joker!
