I am the maelstrom incarnate... The one[n]that you humans call "Enlil"...
If your resolve, determination, and[n]beliefs are as you say... then prove[n]this!

[msg MSG_001 [Futaba]]
I-I'm sensing some insane power!

[msg MSG_002 [Fuuka]]
This is such a powerful opponent...[n]Everyone, please be careful!

[msg MSG_002_3 [Hikari]]
You can do this!

[msg MSG_002_5]
The theatergoer's wishes transformed[n]into the power to oppose Enlil!

[msg MSG_003 [Enlil]]
Humans have learned nothing from the[n]endless cycle of destruction and[n]rebirth.
They oppose providence, manipulated by[n]delusions they call possibilities...
Such a fallacy is due to the simple[n]weakness of human existence.

[msg MSG_004 [Enlil]]
Humans view even an offer of salvation[n]as evil, turning their weapons against[n]it.
Human are truly pathetic. It's no shock[n]that they defy the will of the[n]heavens...
However, even still, I offered my[n]protection to each and every one.

[msg MSG_005 [Enlil]]
Humans know not that "hope" is but a[n]poison that drives them mad―thus, they[n]cling to that which destroys them.
This can only make them regret their[n]decisions and drown in despair...
And that is why I must step in―to save[n]them.

[msg MSG_006 [Enlil]]
Such a pity...
If you hadn't clung to hope... you[n]wouldn't have become so lost.

[msg MSG_007 [Futaba]]
Wh-Whoa, hold on! What was that just[n]now!?

[msg MSG_009 [Enlil]]
Do you realize it now? Humans truly are[n]powerless.

[msg MSG_010 [Hikari]]
Th-This can't be!

[msg MSG_043_5 [Enlil]]
Do you realize it now? Humans truly are[n]powerless.

[msg MSG_043 [Enlil]]
The only salvation for such weak beings[n]is through surrendering to my world.
Thieves like yourselves are nothing but[n]dangerous anomalies that disrupt my[n]order...
Thus, you shall be extinguished by mine[n]own hand.

[msg MSG_040 [Fuuka]]
Everyone!

[msg MSG_014 [Hikari]]
A-Ah...

[msg MSG_012 [Rise]]
No way... Guys! ...Everyone!

[msg MSG_011 [Fuuka]]
I... I'm not getting any readings from[n]them...

[msg MSG_042 [Futaba]]
D-Did... we lose?

[msg MSG_044 [Hikari]]
N-Nnh!

[msg MSG_045 [Futaba]]
H-Hikari!

[msg MSG_015 [Fuuka]]
Hikari-chan...
Please, run! At this rate, she'll even[n]take you down!

[msg MSG_046 [Enlil]]
All is nothing but dust before my[n]wind... Your actions are useless.

[msg MSG_047 [Hikari]]
...No.
They're not useless!

[msg MSG_048 [Enlil]]
......

[msg MSG_049 [Hikari]]
I know it's true! I've watched everyone[n]all this time!
They never gave up inside those movies,[n]not even once!
No matter how hard it was... or how[n]painful...

[msg MSG_050 [Futaba]]
Hikari!

[msg MSG_051 [Hikari]]
We haven't lost yet! I know their[n]power...
I believe in them!

[msg MSG_052 [Fuuka]]
Hikari-chan...

[msg MSG_053 [Enlil]]
Why can't you understand?
Your beliefs were nothing more than[n]false images projected onto a screen...
You knew they were all illusions, yet[n]you still accepted this world, no?

[msg MSG_054 [Hikari]]
It's because I've finally remembered...[n]Thanks to everyone, I remember!
They helped me remember what matters in[n]life!
That's why I believe so much in them![n]They'll never lose―not to you!

[msg MSG_056 [Enlil]]
Hikari...

[msg MSG_057 [Hikari]]
I won't give up!
They've all supported me, so this[n]time... it's my turn!

[msg MSG_059 [Hikari]]
You've overcome every kind of problem[n]you've faced... You never ran away!
I believe... I'm positive that you can[n]do this!

[msg MSG_060 [Hikari]]
Please, everyone!

[msg MSG_061 [Enlil]]
How...

[msg MSG_062 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I heard your voice, Hikari-chan.

[msg MSG_063 [P3 Hero]]
Sorry for the wait.

[msg MSG_064 [P4 Hero]]
Leave the rest to us.

[msg MSG_065 [Enlil]]
You still...

[msg MSG_066 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Don't underestimate our will!

[msg MSG_067 [P4 Hero]]
We've gotten back on our feet countless[n]times before now!

[msg MSG_068 [P3 Hero]]
We WILL win―because we'll never give up.

[sel SEL_069 top]
Let's finish this!
Are you ready?
You did great, Hikari.

[msg MSG_070 [Hikari]]
Guys!

[msg MSG_071 [Enlil]]
Aaaaaaagh!

[msg MSG_008 [Rise]]
Enlil's power is rising... This is so[n]bad!

[msg MSG_041 [Rise]]
No way... C'mon, guys... You gotta get[n]back up!

[msg MSG_013 [Futaba]]
Don't tell me... is everyone down!?

[msg MSG_058 [Hikari]]
Everyone, please! Get back up!
