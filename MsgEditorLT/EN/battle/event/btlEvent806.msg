He's wrapped in film?

[msg MSG_002 [Mitsuru]]
So, Hikari told us she created this[n]being. Is it really okay for us to[n]attack him?

[msg MSG_003 [Futaba]]
But if we don't, Hikari will be in[n]danger! We've gotta protect her!

[msg MSG_004 [Doe]]
Hikari... Hikari...

Hikari-chan, leave this to us!

Hey, could those eyes be...?

[msg MSG_009 [Makoto]]
Yes, that seems to be his weak point.

[msg MSG_010 [Shinjiro]]
In that case, all we gotta do is pummel[n]the hell outta his eyes.

[msg MSG_011 [Aigis]]
Understood. We will finish this at once!

Oh, this smarts... but we'll[n]definitely... rescue you, Hikarin...

[msg MSG_024 [Hikari]]
No! If this keeps up...

[msg MSG_025 [Doe]]
Hikari... Why... are you...

[msg MSG_026 [Hikari]]
No, this isn't right...
Hang in there, everyone... I'll... do[n]something about this!

[msg MSG_027 [Haru]]
You can't! It's too dangerous!

[msg MSG_028 [Futaba]]
Hey! Hikari!?

[msg MSG_029 [Hikari]]
