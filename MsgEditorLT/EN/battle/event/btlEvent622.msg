Why are you fighting so hard for someone[n]else? What pains in the ass...

[msg MSG_000_5 [Yosukesaurus]]
Take a hint for once and die already!

[msg MSG_001 [Naoto]]
Knowing when it's appropriate to speak[n]up is indeed important. However...

That's right! No matter what everyone[n]else might say...

[msg MSG_005 [P4 Hero]]
We'll push forward on the path that we[n]believe in!
