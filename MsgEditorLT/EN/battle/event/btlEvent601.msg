Whoa! Reinforcements!? They look strong[n]too!

[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
Hell no! We ain't your enemy!

[msg MSG_002 [Ann]]
You're friends with Theodore, right?

[msg MSG_003 [Brown-haired girl]]
Huh? You know Theo!?

[msg MSG_004 [Morgana]]
We'll explain later! Let's go, Joker!

[msg MSG_010 [Ryuji]]
Yo, is it just me, or does it feel like[n]our attacks ain't doin' jack to this[n]Shadow?

[msg MSG_011 [Futaba]]
It does! Something seems off about its[n]data too...

[msg MSG_012 [Yusuke]]
If regular attacks won't work, then[n]perhaps we go about this another way...

[msg MSG_013 [Futaba]]
Ooh, that's a pretty good idea coming[n]from you, Inari.
I'll keep analyzing it, so be sure to[n]try different stuff like status ailments[n]too!

[msg MSG_020 [Ann]]
Look! The Shadow changed color!

[msg MSG_021 [Yusuke]]
I believe I saw something shatter around[n]it as well.

[msg MSG_022 [Futaba]]
I got it!
Looks like that one was protected by a[n]"resistance barrier" until now.

[msg MSG_023 [Ann]]
A barrier...? No wonder it felt like our[n]attacks weren't doing much.

[msg MSG_024 [Futaba]]
Seems the barrier can be destroyed if[n]it's damaged enough.

[msg MSG_025 [Yusuke]]
That would mean now's our opportunity.[n]Let's go all out!
