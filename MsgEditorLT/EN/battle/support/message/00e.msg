A powerful enemy! Oh, be careful,[n]everyone!

[msg BTL_MES_014_002]
Okay! I'll back you up!

[msg BTL_MES_014_003]
FOE spotted! And it's far too strong[n]for us to fight.

[msg BTL_MES_014_004]
It's an FOE! Best to avoid it.

[msg BTL_MES_014_005]
Yes, a careful retreat is our best[n]choice.

[msg BTL_MES_014_006]
Yes, we should avoid a confrontation[n]here. Let's pull back.

[msg BTL_MES_014_009]
That FOE excels at physical attacks.[n]Please watch your health accordingly.

[msg BTL_MES_014_010]
Looks like that FOE has strong magic[n]attacks. Don't let it knock you down.

[msg BTL_MES_014_011]
Its attacks gain strength even as it[n]inches toward its demise. Finish it!

[msg BTL_MES_014_012]
That's a rare Shadow! It's going to[n]try to run away!

[msg BTL_MES_014_013]
That's a rare Shadow. It wouldn't[n]surprise me if it tries to leave!

[msg BTL_MES_014_014]
Let's catch it before it escapes!

[msg BTL_MES_014_015]
Quickly, quickly, before it knows[n]what hit it!

[msg BTL_MES_014_018]
An enemy that uses instant kills![n]Surely we should prioritize that one!

[msg BTL_MES_014_019]
Magic attacks won't work right now.[n]Let's try a different angle!

[msg BTL_MES_014_020]
Watch out! Something big is coming!

[msg BTL_MES_014_021]
Careful, everyone! That is one strong[n]adversary!

[msg BTL_MES_014_022]
That one looks tough to beat. I'm[n]scared even though I'm not there!

[msg BTL_MES_014_023]
Retreating is an option too... unless[n]you want to fight?

[msg BTL_MES_014_025]
Oh, I've never seen that enemy[n]before. We must investigate...

[msg BTL_MES_014_026]
Careful, we don't know its[n]weaknesses!

[msg BTL_MES_014_027]
Okay, good luck!

[msg BTL_MES_014_028]
Sounds like a plan, Leader!

[msg BTL_MES_014_029]
Don't be reckless, Yosuke-kun...!

[msg BTL_MES_014_030]
You're the best, Chie-chan!

[msg BTL_MES_014_031]
Let's regroup and pinpoint their[n]weaknesses, Yukiko-chan.

[msg BTL_MES_014_032]
Dummy

[msg BTL_MES_014_033]
Watch yourself, Kanji-kun...!

[msg BTL_MES_014_034]
Nice thinking, Naoto-kun!

[msg BTL_MES_014_035]
I know you can do it, Teddie...!

[msg BTL_MES_014_036]
Stay focused, Yukari-chan.

[msg BTL_MES_014_037]
We have to find its weakness first,[n]Junpei-kun!

[msg BTL_MES_014_038]
Just as reliable as ever,[n]Akihiko-senpai.

[msg BTL_MES_014_039]
I have utter faith in you,[n]Mitsuru-senpai!

[msg BTL_MES_014_040]
Dummy

[msg BTL_MES_014_041]
We're all counting on you, Aigis!

[msg BTL_MES_014_042]
You got this, Ken-kun. We're right[n]behind you!

[msg BTL_MES_014_043]
Go, Koro-chan! Sic 'im, boy!

[msg BTL_MES_014_044]
With Shinjiro-senpai here, we've got[n]nothing to worry about!

[msg BTL_MES_014_045]
Yes, I know you'll be just fine!

[msg BTL_MES_014_046]
Stay vigilant out there, Joker.

[msg BTL_MES_014_047]
Skull... Give it all you got!

[msg BTL_MES_014_048]
Only you can pull off your signature[n]moves, Panther!

[msg BTL_MES_014_049]
Don't get hurt out there, Mona!

[msg BTL_MES_014_050]
Fox is right. None of us should get[n]overconfident!

[msg BTL_MES_014_051]
Very true, Queen, so try different[n]attacks!

[msg BTL_MES_014_052]
Dummy

[msg BTL_MES_014_053]
Good plan, Noir. Let's expose their[n]weaknesses!

[msg BTL_MES_014_054]
Good call, Crow! Yes, let's find[n]their weaknesses first!

[msg BTL_MES_014_055]
This looks easy enough... But don't[n]get complacent!

[msg BTL_MES_014_056]
Don't let your guard down for even a[n]second.

[msg BTL_MES_014_057]
This should be an easy one, as long[n]as we don't hold back.

[msg BTL_MES_014_058]
The enemy hardly poses any threat at[n]all. It's a good opportunity for you!

[msg BTL_MES_014_059]
With your abilities as strong as they[n]are, this will be over in no time.

[msg BTL_MES_014_060]
This won't take any time at all.

[msg BTL_MES_014_061]
Strike at the enemy's weakness, now!

[msg BTL_MES_014_062]
Now's your chance! Go for its[n]weakness!

[msg BTL_MES_014_063]
The escape didn't go as planned...[n]Please hold on!

[msg BTL_MES_014_064]

[msg BTL_MES_014_065]
Enemy reinforcements! And it's an[n]FOE!

[msg BTL_MES_014_066]
Oh no... An FOE joined the fight...!?

[msg BTL_MES_014_067]
Watch out! This is dangerous!

[msg BTL_MES_014_068]
You're in danger, Leader!

[msg BTL_MES_014_069]
There's trouble afoot, Yosuke-kun!

[msg BTL_MES_014_070]
Careful, Chie-chan! I know you'll[n]deny it, but you're flagging!

[msg BTL_MES_014_071]
Look out, Yukiko-chan!

[msg BTL_MES_014_072]
Dummy

[msg BTL_MES_014_073]
Kanji-kun's in a tight spot! He might[n]need help!

[msg BTL_MES_014_074]
Watch it, Naoto-kun!

[msg BTL_MES_014_075]
Teddie can't hold out much longer!

[msg BTL_MES_014_076]
Yukari-chan's really pushing herself![n]She can't keep this up!

[msg BTL_MES_014_077]
Junpei-kun is nearly about to[n]collapse!

[msg BTL_MES_014_078]
Akihiko-senpai could use some help.[n]He can't just punch his way out!

[msg BTL_MES_014_079]
Watch out, Mitsuru-senpai!

[msg BTL_MES_014_080]
Dummy

[msg BTL_MES_014_081]
Aigis is struggling!

[msg BTL_MES_014_082]
Look out, Ken-kun!

[msg BTL_MES_014_083]
Poor little Koro-chan! How dare they!

[msg BTL_MES_014_084]
Shinjiro-senpai is in bad shape!

[msg BTL_MES_014_085]
Someone's in trouble!

[msg BTL_MES_014_086]
No joke, Joker's in trouble!

[msg BTL_MES_014_087]
Somebody help Skull!

[msg BTL_MES_014_088]
Panther could use someone to watch[n]her back!

[msg BTL_MES_014_089]
It's not looking good for Mona!

[msg BTL_MES_014_090]
Fox is trying, but it's too tough!

[msg BTL_MES_014_091]
Queen's not exactly ruling this[n]fight... Someone help her!

[msg BTL_MES_014_092]
Dummy

[msg BTL_MES_014_093]
Noir needs aid, before she blacks[n]out!

[msg BTL_MES_014_094]
Watch out, Crow! You can't afford too[n]many risks right now!

[msg BTL_MES_014_095]
We should probably pull back for now!

[msg BTL_MES_014_096]
Look out! You need to heal[n]quickly...!

[msg BTL_MES_014_097]
Someone's petrified and can't move...

[msg BTL_MES_014_098]
You've been inflicted with something![n]Get rid of it as fast as you can!

[msg BTL_MES_014_099]
Someone's been poisoned. Can you cure[n]it!?

[msg BTL_MES_014_100]
No time for naps! Wake up!

[msg BTL_MES_014_101]
You're confused. Snap out of it!

[msg BTL_MES_014_102]
Someone can't act because they're[n]paralyzed! Can anyone help out?

[msg BTL_MES_014_103]
Someone's stunned! Take care!

[msg BTL_MES_014_104]
Oh no... Your Persona's been bound...

[msg BTL_MES_014_105]
Someone's lost the ability to use[n]physical attacks!

[msg BTL_MES_014_106]
Someone's all bound up and can't move[n]very well!

[msg BTL_MES_014_107]
It's weak to physical attacks! Beat[n]it up!

[msg BTL_MES_014_108]
Fire is its weakness. I say you set[n]it ablaze!

[msg BTL_MES_014_109]
Ice is the most effective! Freeze[n]them where they stand!

[msg BTL_MES_014_110]
It's weak to Wind! You know what to[n]do!

[msg BTL_MES_014_111]
Electric skills would be the most[n]effective. Do you have any?

[msg BTL_MES_014_112]
Its weakness is Nuclear attacks![n]Remember that and you should do well!

[msg BTL_MES_014_113]
I've got a thought; try using your[n]Psychokinesis skills...

[msg BTL_MES_014_114]
It's weak against skills that Bless![n]Do you have any such skills?

[msg BTL_MES_014_115]
Curse skills are the most effective![n]Take advantage of that!

[msg BTL_MES_014_116]
Hm... It seems like it's weak against[n]physical attacks...

[msg BTL_MES_014_117]
Ooh, it hates Fire. Let's use that.

[msg BTL_MES_014_118]
It doesn't like Ice attacks. Let's[n]freeze it where it stands!

[msg BTL_MES_014_119]
It's weak to Wind; we can exploit[n]that!

[msg BTL_MES_014_120]
We'll have the advantage if we use[n]Electricity!

[msg BTL_MES_014_121]
Nuclear attacks seem effective. Use[n]them!

[msg BTL_MES_014_122]
We should target it with[n]Psychokinesis attacks.

[msg BTL_MES_014_124]
Hey, it's pretty fragile when exposed[n]to a Curse!

[msg BTL_MES_014_125]
Well done, everyone! Let's keep up[n]the pace!

[msg BTL_MES_014_126]
We're making steady progress,[n]everyone. Keep up the good work!

[msg BTL_MES_014_127]
We're close to victory! Don't stop[n]now!

[msg BTL_MES_014_128]
We got this! I have faith in all of[n]you!

[msg BTL_MES_014_129]
How about using a Baton Pass?

[msg BTL_MES_014_130]
You could do some impressive damage[n]with a Baton Pass right about now!

[msg BTL_MES_014_131]
I'm ready to provide support,[n]whenever you need me!

[msg BTL_MES_014_132]
I'm happy to support you! Just call[n]on me anytime you need me.

[msg BTL_MES_014_133]
Let's finish this quick!

[msg BTL_MES_014_134]
I know we can win!

[msg BTL_MES_014_135]
Well done!

[msg BTL_MES_014_136]
Perfectly executed, Leader!

[msg BTL_MES_014_137]
You did it, Yosuke-kun!

[msg BTL_MES_014_138]
That was amazing, Chie-chan!

Impressive, Yukiko-chan!

Dummy

[msg BTL_MES_014_141]
Goodness, Kanji-kun, that was[n]amazing!

[msg BTL_MES_014_142]
How did you even do that, Naoto-kun!?

[msg BTL_MES_014_143]
Quite an achievement, Teddie!

[msg BTL_MES_014_144]
That was perfect, Yukari-chan!

[msg BTL_MES_014_145]
Fantastic, Junpei-kun!

[msg BTL_MES_014_146]
You nailed it, Akihiko-senpai!

Perfectly executed, Mitsuru-senpai!

Dummy

[msg BTL_MES_014_149]
That was awesome, Aigis!

[msg BTL_MES_014_150]
That's it, Ken-kun!

[msg BTL_MES_014_151]
You deserve a treat, Koro-chan!

[msg BTL_MES_014_152]
Right on target, Shinjiro-senpai!

[msg BTL_MES_014_153]
Nice moves!

[msg BTL_MES_014_154]
That was beautiful, Joker!

[msg BTL_MES_014_155]
Very impressive!

[msg BTL_MES_014_156]
Looking good, Panther!

[msg BTL_MES_014_157]
Well done!

[msg BTL_MES_014_165]
It looks like we have no choice but[n]to fight... I'll handle the support!

[msg BTL_MES_014_166]
We have to win... If only for Ribbon-[n]chan's sake!

[msg BTL_MES_014_167]
This world... it's all wrong. It's[n]about time we set it straight!

[msg BTL_MES_014_168]
Oracle and Ribbon-chan have disabled[n]the auto-repair function. Go now!

[msg BTL_MES_014_169]
Its auto-repair function is disabled.[n]Now's your chance!

[msg BTL_MES_014_170]
Wha... No!

[msg BTL_MES_014_171]
Oh my... It's much more dangerous[n]now... I'm worried for you all!

[msg BTL_MES_014_172]
Target its eye, wherever it may be!

[msg BTL_MES_014_173]
Is that its weak spot? Keep attacking[n]it!

[msg BTL_MES_014_174]
No... That wasn't its weak point...?

[msg BTL_MES_014_175]
If this keeps up...

[msg BTL_MES_014_176]
Hikari-chan's support... This might[n]be just what we need!

[msg BTL_MES_014_177]
It's working! We have a chance, after[n]all!

We've come this far. The only way is[n]forward! Let's go!

Yet another thing to worry about―the[n]enemy just changed its affinity!

Time is moving backwards! I don't[n]know what to think anymore...

[msg BTL_MES_014_185]
What a terror... She's using our own[n]actions from the future against us!
