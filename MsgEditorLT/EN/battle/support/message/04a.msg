[msg BTL_MES_026_001]
Fear not. This should be easy for[n]you...

[msg BTL_MES_026_002]
Now, it's time for battle!

[msg BTL_MES_026_003]
Oh my... Dear me...

[msg BTL_MES_026_004]
I recommend you retreat at once.

[msg BTL_MES_026_005]
Hm... Yes, it is indeed an FOE.[n]However...

[msg BTL_MES_026_007]
The enemy wields a powerful skill. It[n]may be best to defend yourselves.

[msg BTL_MES_026_008]
This enemy excels in physical[n]attacks. Please bear this in mind.

[msg BTL_MES_026_009]
This enemy excels in magic attacks.[n]Please be careful.

[msg BTL_MES_026_010]
This enemy seems to go on a rampage[n]when wounded. Defeat it quickly!

[msg BTL_MES_026_012]
It'd be rather embarrassing if you[n]let this one escape...

[msg BTL_MES_026_013]
What's this...? I'm sensing an[n]extraordinary presence nearby...

[msg BTL_MES_026_014]
Dear me... To think Theo would end up[n]explaining everything...

[msg BTL_MES_026_015]
It seems this enemy deals out an area[n]attack.

[msg BTL_MES_026_016]
I'm certain a well-timed guard will[n]help you withstand it...

[msg BTL_MES_026_017]
My... One of these can use instant[n]kill attacks... No matter.

[msg BTL_MES_026_018]
All we can do now is pray that it[n]doesn't work...

[msg BTL_MES_026_019]
It seems affinity attacks won’t work.

[msg BTL_MES_026_020]
This is quite an impertinent enemy.

[msg BTL_MES_026_021]
Huuuge attack forthcoming.

[msg BTL_MES_026_023]
My... This should prove easy[n]enough...

[msg BTL_MES_026_024]
Yes, it should put up an excellent[n]fight.

[msg BTL_MES_026_025]
Oh...? We've yet to see this.

[msg BTL_MES_026_026]
Well then, why not greet it with an[n]affinity attack?

[msg BTL_MES_026_027]
This seems to be a well-matched[n]opponent.

[msg BTL_MES_026_028]
You're mostly equal to it. In a way,[n]it's quite a suitable opponent.

[msg BTL_MES_026_029]
Well, this will no doubt be easy!

[msg BTL_MES_026_030]
Yes. Three seconds is all it will[n]take.

[msg BTL_MES_026_031]
My... It seems something's changed...

[msg BTL_MES_026_032]
I believe now is the time to strike[n]its weakness.

[msg BTL_MES_026_033]
Ding-dong-ding-dong. I have truly[n]unfortunate news for you...

[msg BTL_MES_026_034]
Yes, this is all because of my[n]unworthy brother, Theo.

[msg BTL_MES_026_035]
Dear me, dear me...

[msg BTL_MES_026_036]
An FOE has joined the fray.

[msg BTL_MES_026_037]
Someone in your party seems to be in[n]trouble... Will they be all right?

[msg BTL_MES_026_038]
Someone is in terrible danger... It[n]may be best to aid them.

[msg BTL_MES_026_039]
Oh dear... Yosuke is in a sorry[n]state.

[msg BTL_MES_026_040]
Oh my... It seems Chie is at her[n]wit's end.

[msg BTL_MES_026_041]
Is Yukiko all right?

[msg BTL_MES_026_042]
Dummy

[msg BTL_MES_026_043]
Kanji is close to meeting his maker.

[msg BTL_MES_026_044]
Naoto looks like the walking dead...

[msg BTL_MES_026_045]
Oh? Teddie looks as though he's mere[n]inches from death...

[msg BTL_MES_026_046]
Yukari... She can barely stand.

[msg BTL_MES_026_047]
If Junpei is left unattended, he'll[n]most certainly meet his demise...

[msg BTL_MES_026_048]
Oh, Akihiko... Your face looks whiter[n]than usual...

[msg BTL_MES_026_049]
Oh, my... Mitsuru's health gauge is[n]bright red.

[msg BTL_MES_026_050]
Dummy

[msg BTL_MES_026_051]
Is Aigis all right? She seems[n]strained.

[msg BTL_MES_026_052]
Please observe Ken's health!

[msg BTL_MES_026_053]
Koromaru seems to be in pain... I'm[n]terribly worried for him.

[msg BTL_MES_026_054]
Shinjiro may appear calm, but I[n]believe he's in trouble...

[msg BTL_MES_026_055]
Oh my... It appears someone needs[n]help...

Mona... You were so full of energy a[n]moment ago...

[msg BTL_MES_026_060]

Please tend to Queen's health!

Dummy

[msg BTL_MES_026_063]
My... Noir doesn't seem to be faring[n]well...

[msg BTL_MES_026_064]
Crow... Will he last till the end?

[msg BTL_MES_026_065]
Why not prioritize healing first?

[msg BTL_MES_026_066]
My... I spy a statue over there...

[msg BTL_MES_026_067]
It seems someone has been cursed.

[msg BTL_MES_026_068]
Oh...? It seems they've been[n]poisoned.

[msg BTL_MES_026_069]
Oh dear... You won't be able to wake[n]them that easily.

[msg BTL_MES_026_070]
It seems someone is in a state of[n]confusion.

[msg BTL_MES_026_071]
My... You've been paralyzed.

[msg BTL_MES_026_072]
From the look of things... they're[n]stunned.

[msg BTL_MES_026_073]
Dear me... Their magic is bound...

[msg BTL_MES_026_074]
Please be careful. Your strength is[n]bound.

[msg BTL_MES_026_075]
Your agility has been bound...

[msg BTL_MES_026_076]
If you have a means of healing this,[n]please do so without hesitation.

[msg BTL_MES_026_077]
It's weak to Physical...? Tragic.

[msg BTL_MES_026_078]
One of these enemies is weak to Fire.[n]Why not give it a nice roast?

[msg BTL_MES_026_079]
It seems the enemy dislikes the cold.

[msg BTL_MES_026_080]
One of these enemies is weak to[n]Wind...

[msg BTL_MES_026_081]
One of these is weak to Electricity.[n]Might I suggest a good shock?

[msg BTL_MES_026_082]
Oh...? The enemy seems to be weak to[n]Nuclear...

[msg BTL_MES_026_084]
To think it's weak to Bless... This[n]calls for a celebration!

[msg BTL_MES_026_085]
One of these is weak to the Curse[n]affinity. How about a curse or two?

[msg BTL_MES_026_086]
The enemy... It appears it's weak to[n]physical attacks.

[msg BTL_MES_026_087]
Might I suggest incinerating one of[n]these enemies?

[msg BTL_MES_026_088]
One of these enemies is weak to the[n]Ice affinity.

[msg BTL_MES_026_089]
If you wish to strike its weakness, I[n]would suggest using Wind.

[msg BTL_MES_026_090]
This enemy... Electricity may do the[n]trick.

[msg BTL_MES_026_091]
Hm? You wish to strike its weakness?[n]Might I suggest Nuclear?

[msg BTL_MES_026_092]
The Psychokinesis affinity may give[n]you the advantage...

[msg BTL_MES_026_093]
This enemy... It appears it's weak to[n]Bless...

[msg BTL_MES_026_094]
One of these enemies is weak to the[n]Curse affinity. Curse away.

[msg BTL_MES_026_095]
...Then, there's only one way to go[n]about this.

[msg BTL_MES_026_096]
Now, who will make the first move?

[msg BTL_MES_026_097]
That's our Yosuke! Go, go!

[msg BTL_MES_026_098]
Ah... If only Chie were here at a[n]time like this... *glance*

[msg BTL_MES_026_099]
Yukiko... I'm looking at you.

[msg BTL_MES_026_100]
Dummy

[msg BTL_MES_026_101]
Kanji, when can you possibly hope to[n]act if you don't act now?

[msg BTL_MES_026_102]
I'm certain Naoto will perform above[n]and beyond all expectations!

[msg BTL_MES_026_103]
Come now, Teddie, let's go! If you[n]can't do it, no one can!

[msg BTL_MES_026_104]
I'm certain you'll rise up to our[n]expectations, Yukari.

[msg BTL_MES_026_105]
If you truly are the world renowned[n]Junpei, you'll be just fine, correct?

[msg BTL_MES_026_106]
I'm certain Akihiko will produce good[n]results...

[msg BTL_MES_026_107]
I believe this is Mitsuru's area of[n]expertise...

[msg BTL_MES_026_108]
Dummy

[msg BTL_MES_026_109]
...I hope you caught that, Aigis.

[msg BTL_MES_026_110]
This is your time to shine, Ken! Now,[n]go forth!

[msg BTL_MES_026_111]
Show us the true beast within,[n]Koromaru.

[msg BTL_MES_026_112]
I'm certain Shinjiro can pull this[n]off.

[msg BTL_MES_026_113]
Well then, hit it with everything[n]you've got! Go for it!

[msg BTL_MES_026_114]
Well then, it's time you let loose on[n]the enemy!

[msg BTL_MES_026_115]
Come now, Skull! It's your turn.

[msg BTL_MES_026_116]
I have high hopes for you, Panther![n]Go for a grand slam!

[msg BTL_MES_026_117]
Go forth with confidence, Mona![n]Onward!

[msg BTL_MES_026_118]
Pardon my forwardness... but I[n]believe this is your moment, Fox.

[msg BTL_MES_026_119]
Ah... I can see Queen making short[n]work of this.

[msg BTL_MES_026_120]
Dummy

[msg BTL_MES_026_121]
Noir, now is your time to strike!

[msg BTL_MES_026_122]
How about it, Crow? Come now! Go, go,[n]go!

Phew... I leave the rest to you,[n]Theo.

[msg BTL_MES_026_125]
Yes, feel free to take your time with[n]this one.

[msg BTL_MES_026_126]
I will be watching over you with all[n]my heart.

[msg BTL_MES_026_127]
Why not try a Baton Pass?

[msg BTL_MES_026_128]
Don't moments like this call for[n]something? A Baton... whatever?

[msg BTL_MES_026_129]
As it is often said, amazing boost!

[msg BTL_MES_026_130]
Oh...? He's earned a boost!

[msg BTL_MES_026_131]
Yosuke may prove useful here...[n]Maybe...

[msg BTL_MES_026_132]
Ah... Chie is looking quite super...

[msg BTL_MES_026_133]
You certainly seem motivated, Yukiko.

[msg BTL_MES_026_134]
Dummy

[msg BTL_MES_026_135]
My... Kanji seems rather confident[n]thanks to his boost.

[msg BTL_MES_026_136]
Excellent boost, Naoto.

[msg BTL_MES_026_137]
Oh...? Teddie seems to have been[n]critically boosted.

[msg BTL_MES_026_138]
Yukari appears to be flowing with[n]even more energy than usual...

[msg BTL_MES_026_139]
Junpei is currently boosted. This is[n]his moment.

[msg BTL_MES_026_140]
Pay attention to Akihiko. It appears[n]he's at full throttle.

[msg BTL_MES_026_141]
Mitsuru is in execution mode―I[n]mean... She has earned a boost.

[msg BTL_MES_026_142]
Dummy

[msg BTL_MES_026_143]
Aigis is in a boosted state. Please[n]don't overexert yourself...

[msg BTL_MES_026_144]
Ken is fully boosted.

[msg BTL_MES_026_145]
It seems Koromaru has fully unleashed[n]his wild side!

[msg BTL_MES_026_146]
My, my, amazing boost, Shinjiro.

[msg BTL_MES_026_147]
Please observe your party. Someone[n]has earned a boost.

[msg BTL_MES_026_148]
I spy someone in a boosted state.

[msg BTL_MES_026_149]
Skull is shining even brighter than[n]usual.

[msg BTL_MES_026_150]
An amazing boost, Panther.

[msg BTL_MES_026_151]
Mona seems fired up...

[msg BTL_MES_026_152]
My, Fox... You certainly are excited.

[msg BTL_MES_026_153]
Queen is on fire! Well, not really, I[n]suppose I mean she's been boosted!

[msg BTL_MES_026_154]
Dummy

[msg BTL_MES_026_155]
Oh...? Noir looks a bit more shiny[n]than usual.

[msg BTL_MES_026_156]
Crow has earned a boost.

[msg BTL_MES_026_157]
Let's continue to target their[n]weaknesses!

[msg BTL_MES_026_158]
On top of that, we can target their[n]weakness... My, my...

[msg BTL_MES_026_159]
I'm fully prepared to provide[n]support.

[msg BTL_MES_026_162]
Uh, Sister! This is a powerful enemy!

[msg BTL_MES_026_163]
An FOE!? This doesn't look good...

[msg BTL_MES_026_164]
It’s an FOE! Please retreat at once!

[msg BTL_MES_026_165]
This FOE... You may stand a chance[n]now...

[msg BTL_MES_026_166]
This enemy excels in defense. You'll[n]want to plan your attacks carefully.

[msg BTL_MES_026_167]
It seems this enemy possesses a most[n]powerful attack. Please be careful.

[msg BTL_MES_026_168]
The enemy excels in physical attacks.[n]Pay attention to how it moves.

[msg BTL_MES_026_169]
The enemy excels in magic attacks.[n]Keep an eye on your health.

[msg BTL_MES_026_170]
This enemy grows stronger when[n]weakened. Best defeat it immediately.

[msg BTL_MES_026_171]
Look! It’s a rare Shadow!

[msg BTL_MES_026_172]
We dare not waste this opportunity!

[msg BTL_MES_026_176]
Everyone, please be sure to guard.

[msg BTL_MES_026_177]
One of these enemies can deliver an[n]instant kill attack!

[msg BTL_MES_026_178]
No, it’s still dangerous... Unless[n]you happen to have a plan?

[msg BTL_MES_026_179]
It seems only physical attacks will[n]work...

[msg BTL_MES_026_180]
Indeed. It seems our only choice is[n]to resort to physical attacks...

[msg BTL_MES_026_181]
A powerful attack is imminent!

[msg BTL_MES_026_182]
Please defend yourselves!

[msg BTL_MES_026_183]
This enemy may prove quite[n]powerful...

[msg BTL_MES_026_184]
Indee―Wait, no! This enemy is not to[n]be taken lightly!

[msg BTL_MES_026_185]
This enemy is a first...

[msg BTL_MES_026_186]
Well then, let’s search for its[n]weakness, shall we?

[msg BTL_MES_026_187]
It’s neither strong nor weak...

I don't believe these will present[n]you with any trouble.

[msg BTL_MES_026_190]
Sister... Could you perhaps provide a[n]little more detail...?

[msg BTL_MES_026_191]
Hm...? Something about the enemy has[n]changed!

[msg BTL_MES_026_192]
Perhaps you can target its weakness[n]now?

[msg BTL_MES_026_193]
It’s no use... I can't seem to locate[n]an escape route...

[msg BTL_MES_026_194]
I wasn't able to locate an escape[n]route... Please forgive me.

[msg BTL_MES_026_195]
Oh no... It’s come...

[msg BTL_MES_026_196]
It’s an FOE! Please be careful!

[msg BTL_MES_026_197]
Someone is in danger. Please take[n]caution.

[msg BTL_MES_026_198]
One of you is in danger. You cannot[n]leave them be.

[msg BTL_MES_026_199]
Are you all right, Yosuke? You look[n]as though you can barely stand!

[msg BTL_MES_026_200]
You shouldn’t push yourself so hard,[n]Chie!

[msg BTL_MES_026_201]
Please be mindful of Yukiko’s health.

[msg BTL_MES_026_202]
Dummy

Oh no, Kanji... He’ll collapse at[n]this rate!

[msg BTL_MES_026_207]
Are you all right, Junpei? Watch your[n]footing!

[msg BTL_MES_026_208]
Um... Is Akihiko all right? He looks[n]as though he may collapse any moment.

Ken is in danger. Please help him[n]out!

[msg BTL_MES_026_213]
Koromaru, you shouldn’t keep fighting[n]in this condition...

[msg BTL_MES_026_214]
I can see pain in Shinjiro’s face...

[msg BTL_MES_026_215]
Oh no... They're in critical[n]condition! Someone please help them!

At this rate, Queen won’t last much[n]longer!

[msg BTL_MES_026_222]
Dummy

[msg BTL_MES_026_223]
Is Noir all right? She seems to be in[n]a great deal of pain...

[msg BTL_MES_026_224]
Oh, Crow is on the verge of collapse!

[msg BTL_MES_026_225]
You must heal at once!

[msg BTL_MES_026_226]
This isn’t good! They’re petrified!

[msg BTL_MES_026_227]
They’ve been cursed...

[msg BTL_MES_026_228]
Please be careful. You’ve been[n]poisoned!

[msg BTL_MES_026_229]
To fall asleep at a time like this...[n]Please wake up!

Do you possess a Psychokinesis skill?[n]One of these enemies is weak to them!

[msg BTL_MES_026_244]

[msg BTL_MES_026_254]
I believe Curse will prove effective!

[msg BTL_MES_026_255]
By all means, strike its weakness!

[msg BTL_MES_026_256]
Ah, you should target its weakness!

[msg BTL_MES_026_273]
Would anyone like to try?

[msg BTL_MES_026_274]
Why not target its weakness?

Sister... I hope you don't mean to[n]say you’re bored...

[msg BTL_MES_026_287]
Oh, someone can strike its weakness!
