[msg BTL_MES_026_005]
No harm in running away. Better safe[n]than sorry!

[msg BTL_MES_026_006]

[msg BTL_MES_026_014]
All right! Get it before it runs[n]off...!

[msg BTL_MES_026_015]
Take aim and don't let it escape!

[msg BTL_MES_026_016]
That one can hit everyone at once.[n]Watch for the signs!

[msg BTL_MES_026_017]
That Shadow can hit multiple targets![n]Be ready to guard!

[msg BTL_MES_026_018]
That one can instant kill! Take it[n]down first!

It's fight or flight here, guys!

[msg BTL_MES_026_024]
What's it gonna be? Fight or run?

[msg BTL_MES_026_025]
This enemy's new... Don't let it get[n]the better of you!

[msg BTL_MES_026_026]

[msg BTL_MES_026_061]
Now's our chance! Aim for its[n]weakness!

[msg BTL_MES_026_062]
We can hit its weakness! Give it your[n]all!

[msg BTL_MES_026_063]
Dammit... No way out...

Hrngg... No openings...

Someone, help Shinjiro!

Noir needs help! Hurry!

[msg BTL_MES_026_094]
Crow's dead meat if we don't do[n]something quick!

[msg BTL_MES_026_095]
Hey! Everyone all right?

[msg BTL_MES_026_096]
We can always run...!

[msg BTL_MES_026_097]
They're petrified! They won't be able[n]to move!

[msg BTL_MES_026_098]
They're cursed! Focus on healing!

[msg BTL_MES_026_099]
Not good! They're poisoned!

[msg BTL_MES_026_100]
Hey! Stop sleeping and wake up!

[msg BTL_MES_026_101]
Get a hold of yourself!

[msg BTL_MES_026_102]
Paralysis is slowing them down...

[msg BTL_MES_026_103]
Heeey! Snap out of it!

[msg BTL_MES_026_104]
Watch out! You won't be able to use[n]your Persona!

[msg BTL_MES_026_105]
Careful! You can't use any physical[n]attacks!

[msg BTL_MES_026_106]
Grr... They can't do much like[n]this...

[msg BTL_MES_026_107]
It's weak to physical attacks! Give[n]it all you got!

[msg BTL_MES_026_108]
It's weak against fire! Light it up!

[msg BTL_MES_026_109]
This one's weak against ice! Time to[n]cool out!

[msg BTL_MES_026_110]
It's weak to wind! Blow it away!

[msg BTL_MES_026_111]
Electricity oughta work... Think you[n]can manage?

[msg BTL_MES_026_112]
Nuclear power! Take it out in one[n]shot!

[msg BTL_MES_026_113]
Psychokinesis, huh...? Okay, let's do[n]it!

[msg BTL_MES_026_114]
Bless is its weakness! Unleash[n]judgment!

[msg BTL_MES_026_115]
Curse should do the trick! Show it[n]who's boss!

[msg BTL_MES_026_116]
Use physical attacks to bring it[n]down!

[msg BTL_MES_026_117]
Use Fire! Burn, baby, burn!

[msg BTL_MES_026_118]
Oh? Looks like it's weak against ice![n]Freeze away!

[msg BTL_MES_026_119]
Weak against wind, huh? You got that?

[msg BTL_MES_026_120]
It's weak against electricity! Give[n]it a good zap!

[msg BTL_MES_026_121]
It's weak to nuclear attacks! Give it[n]all you got!

[msg BTL_MES_026_122]
Psychokinesis! Ready, aim, fire!

[msg BTL_MES_026_123]
Oh! It's weak against Bless! Show 'em[n]the light!

[msg BTL_MES_026_124]
Use Curse to wipe 'em out!

[msg BTL_MES_026_125]
All right! Let's go for it!

[msg BTL_MES_026_126]
You guys are doing awesome! Great[n]job!

[msg BTL_MES_026_127]

[msg BTL_MES_026_162]
You're on a roll, Crow!

[msg BTL_MES_026_163]
Dummy

[msg BTL_MES_026_164]
Dummy

[msg BTL_MES_026_165]
Guess we have to fight! I've got your[n]back!

[msg BTL_MES_026_166]
We can take these guys. Use those[n]Personas!

[msg BTL_MES_026_167]
Let's do this! Try different attacks[n]to find its weakness!

[msg BTL_MES_026_168]
Use a "guard" skill if you wanna[n]defend your friends!

[msg BTL_MES_026_169]
That one must be rare! Don't let it[n]escape, Joker!

[msg BTL_MES_026_170]
Down every Shadow for an all-out[n]attack!

[msg BTL_MES_026_171]
Boost with a Baton Pass! Show 'em how[n]its done!

[msg BTL_MES_026_172]
They called for backup!? These are[n]new... Stay alert!

[msg BTL_MES_026_173]
Shadow status changed! Maybe we'll[n]find a weakness!

[msg BTL_MES_026_174]
Hero, my butt! We'll show him!

[msg BTL_MES_026_175]
What's going on!? Are you guys okay?

[msg BTL_MES_026_176]
This isn't good! Get out of there[n]quick!

[msg BTL_MES_026_177]
Okay, let's shut this guy up!

[msg BTL_MES_026_178]
He's got nothing on him now! I say[n]it's payback time!

[msg BTL_MES_026_179]
Yeah! Go! Kick the snot outta that[n]wannabe hero!

[msg BTL_MES_026_180]
Nice form... Still, he's stronger[n]now! Watch out!

[msg BTL_MES_026_181]
Those carrots are in the way. Maybe[n]we can break them!

[msg BTL_MES_026_182]
Great! He can't use those carrots[n]anymore!

[msg BTL_MES_026_183]
There's no backing out of this one...[n]Let 'im have it!

[msg BTL_MES_026_184]
The others are joining in? Keep your[n]guard up!

[msg BTL_MES_026_185]
Not good... Take care of the ones in[n]the back first!

[msg BTL_MES_026_186]
Focus on the ones in the back!

[msg BTL_MES_026_187]
We should be able to take him down[n]now! Let loose!

[msg BTL_MES_026_188]
This is for Ribbon! We can't lose!

[msg BTL_MES_026_189]
A world like this is wrong! We have[n]to put a stop to it!

[msg BTL_MES_026_190]
Ribbon disabled the auto-heal! Now's[n]our chance!

[msg BTL_MES_026_191]
It shouldn't be able to heal itself[n]anymore! Finish it off!

[msg BTL_MES_026_192]
Is that even allowed!?

[msg BTL_MES_026_193]
It's out of control... Stay alert[n]guys!

[msg BTL_MES_026_194]
Go for the eyes!

[msg BTL_MES_026_195]
Is that its weak point? Focus your[n]attacks there!

[msg BTL_MES_026_196]
What!? That's not its weak point?

[msg BTL_MES_026_197]
No... If this keeps up...

[msg BTL_MES_026_198]
Hikari's support... We just might be[n]able to do this!

[msg BTL_MES_026_199]
Yeah! It's working!

[msg BTL_MES_026_200]
Her presence is incredible... You[n]guys be careful!

[msg BTL_MES_026_201]
We've come this far! Let's finish[n]this!

[msg BTL_MES_026_202]
The enemy's affinity changed! Watch[n]out!

[msg BTL_MES_026_203]
It's built up a lot of power... If it[n]attacks, we're screwed!

[msg BTL_MES_026_204]
What the...!? Time's skipping[n]forward!?

[msg BTL_MES_026_205]
How can she attack us while skipping[n]through time...?

[msg BTL_MES_026_206]
Huh!? What happened? Did we go back[n]in time?

[msg BTL_MES_026_207]
She remembers what we did before[n]going back!? No way...
