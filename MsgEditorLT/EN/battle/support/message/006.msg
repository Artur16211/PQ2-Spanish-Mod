That one looks tough... Careful,[n]guys!

[msg BTL_MES_006_002]
Stay on guard, everybody!

[msg BTL_MES_006_003]
Oh no, an FOE...!? We should back[n]off!

[msg BTL_MES_006_004]
An FOE is there! Don't fight it!

[msg BTL_MES_006_005]
Yeah, this is waaay too much to[n]handle. Let's get outta here!

[msg BTL_MES_006_006]
Retreat, retreat! And watch your[n]backs in case it chases you!

[msg BTL_MES_006_007]
We need a plan to bypass its defense.[n]I know a thick skin when I see it!

[msg BTL_MES_006_008]
That one's got really powerful[n]attacks! Don't push yourselves!

[msg BTL_MES_006_009]
Careful, that FOE's got super-strong[n]physical attacks!

[msg BTL_MES_006_010]
Watch out, that FOE's magic attacks[n]are no joke!

There's a rare Shadow! Take it down,[n]quick!

[msg BTL_MES_006_014]

[msg BTL_MES_006_019]
Magic attacks won't work right now.[n]Use something else!

[msg BTL_MES_006_020]
Watch out! The next attack is a big[n]one!

[msg BTL_MES_006_021]
Yipe, that one's intimidating...[n]Careful!

[msg BTL_MES_006_022]
Uh-oh... Looks like they got the jump[n]on us...

[msg BTL_MES_006_023]
We might win, if we go all out! What[n]should we do...

[msg BTL_MES_006_024]
Don't be reckless! If it looks too[n]tough, your best option is to run!

[msg BTL_MES_006_026]
That's a new enemy type, so we don't[n]know its weaknesses!

[msg BTL_MES_006_027]
Go get 'em, Senpai!

[msg BTL_MES_006_028]
You can do it! I know you can!

[msg BTL_MES_006_029]
Be careful, Yosuke-senpai!

[msg BTL_MES_006_030]
Go for it, Chie-senpai!

No holding back, Yukiko-senpai!

[msg BTL_MES_006_032]
Dummy

[msg BTL_MES_006_033]
Beat 'em to a pulp, Kanji!

[msg BTL_MES_006_034]
You've got this, Naoto-kun!

[msg BTL_MES_006_035]
Go Teddie!

[msg BTL_MES_006_036]
You can do it, Yukari-chan!

[msg BTL_MES_006_037]
Junpei-san, let's stay cool and find[n]its weaknesses!

[msg BTL_MES_006_038]
A-Akihiko-san!? Let's take it easy,[n]okay?

[msg BTL_MES_006_039]
Mitsuru-san looks so cool...

[msg BTL_MES_006_040]
Dummy

[msg BTL_MES_006_041]
Do it, Aigis!

[msg BTL_MES_006_042]
Stay calm, Ken-kun! We're cheering[n]for you!

[msg BTL_MES_006_043]
Go get 'em, Koro-chan!

[msg BTL_MES_006_044]
We're counting on you, Shinjiro-san!

[msg BTL_MES_006_045]
Go for it! We've got your back!

[msg BTL_MES_006_046]
That's it, Joker!

[msg BTL_MES_006_047]
Good luck, Skull!

[msg BTL_MES_006_048]
Keep it going, Panther!

[msg BTL_MES_006_049]
Nice idea, Mona!

[msg BTL_MES_006_050]
Go for it, Fox!

Go on, Queen! I'll be supporting you!

[msg BTL_MES_006_052]
Dummy

[msg BTL_MES_006_053]
Sounds good, Noir! Go for it!

[msg BTL_MES_006_054]
You can do it, Crow!

[msg BTL_MES_006_055]
Nothing you can't handle, just keep[n]your focus!

[msg BTL_MES_006_056]
Don't let your guard down!

[msg BTL_MES_006_057]
This looks easy enough, but don't get[n]careless.

[msg BTL_MES_006_058]
Hah, this one's no problem. Let's[n]make it quick!

[msg BTL_MES_006_059]
Let's get this over with, guys!

[msg BTL_MES_006_060]
Take 'em all down!

[msg BTL_MES_006_061]
Don't forget, you can strike the[n]enemy's weakness!

[msg BTL_MES_006_062]
Here's your chance! Go for its weak[n]point!

[msg BTL_MES_006_063]
Oh no, what do we do...!? We can't[n]get away!

[msg BTL_MES_006_064]
The escape attempt failed! Look out!

[msg BTL_MES_006_065]
N-No way...! An FOE appeared!

[msg BTL_MES_006_066]
I thought everyone knew it's rude to[n]invade personal space. Guess NOT!

[msg BTL_MES_006_067]
Ah! Senpai, you're in serious[n]condition! Are you going to be okay!?

[msg BTL_MES_006_068]
Careful, someone's in critical[n]condition!

[msg BTL_MES_006_069]
Yosuke-senpai is in danger! Keep an[n]eye on him!

[msg BTL_MES_006_070]

Naoto-kun is in danger!

[msg BTL_MES_006_075]
Teddie's in a tough spot!

[msg BTL_MES_006_076]
Yukari-chan isn't doing so well!

[msg BTL_MES_006_077]
It's not looking good for Junpei-san!

[msg BTL_MES_006_078]
Akihiko-san is in bad shape!

[msg BTL_MES_006_079]
Mitsuru-san's not looking so good!

[msg BTL_MES_006_080]
Dummy

[msg BTL_MES_006_081]
It's getting dangerous for Aigis!

[msg BTL_MES_006_082]
Ken-kun is in trouble!

[msg BTL_MES_006_083]
Poor Koro-chan is hurt!

[msg BTL_MES_006_084]
Shinjiro-san's in a bad situation[n]right now!

[msg BTL_MES_006_085]
Careful! It wouldn't take much more[n]to knock you out!

[msg BTL_MES_006_086]
Joker looks like he could use some[n]help!

[msg BTL_MES_006_087]
Look out, Skull! You're in bad shape!

[msg BTL_MES_006_088]
Panther really needs help, any help!

[msg BTL_MES_006_089]
Mona is in trouble!

[msg BTL_MES_006_090]
Watch out! Fox is floundering!

[msg BTL_MES_006_091]
Queen looks like she's in royal[n]trouble!

[msg BTL_MES_006_092]
Dummy

[msg BTL_MES_006_093]
Noir's situation is looking dire!

[msg BTL_MES_006_094]
Look out! Crow's teetering on the[n]edge of consciousness!

[msg BTL_MES_006_095]
This doesn't look good... Maybe we[n]should fall back?

[msg BTL_MES_006_096]
Are you okay!? Quick, you need to[n]heal!

[msg BTL_MES_006_097]
Oh no! Someone's been petrified!

[msg BTL_MES_006_098]
Whoa! When you attack, you deal[n]damage to yourself too!

[msg BTL_MES_006_099]
You need to cure that poison, quick!

[msg BTL_MES_006_100]
Somebody's asleep! Wake 'em up!

[msg BTL_MES_006_101]
Somebody's confused! How do we get[n]them to come to their senses?

[msg BTL_MES_006_102]
Wha―!? Someone's been paralyzed!

[msg BTL_MES_006_103]
Are you okay!? Hang in there!

[msg BTL_MES_006_104]
Oh no! Your Persona's been bound!

[msg BTL_MES_006_105]
You can't do physical attacks right[n]now!

[msg BTL_MES_006_106]
Your movement's been slowed down![n]Watch out for incoming attacks!

[msg BTL_MES_006_107]
It's weak against physical attacks![n]Beat it to a pulp!

[msg BTL_MES_006_108]
It's weak against Fire. Burn it down!

[msg BTL_MES_006_109]
It's weak against Ice. Freeze,[n]Shadow!

[msg BTL_MES_006_110]
Use Wind attacks! Blow its mind!

[msg BTL_MES_006_111]
Its weakness is Electricity. Do[n]something that'll leave it shocked!

[msg BTL_MES_006_112]
It's weak against Nuclear attacks![n]Let's show it we're the bomb!

[msg BTL_MES_006_113]
It's weak against Psychokinesis![n]Let's think through this one!

[msg BTL_MES_006_114]
It's weak against Bless skills! Let's[n]make it pray for its end!

[msg BTL_MES_006_115]
It's weak against Curse skills! Time[n]for an unholy reckoning!

[msg BTL_MES_006_116]
Use physical attacks on that one!

[msg BTL_MES_006_117]
Fire is effective! Burn them all!

[msg BTL_MES_006_118]
It hates the cold! But who doesn't!?[n]Anyway, try attacking with Ice!

[msg BTL_MES_006_119]
It's weak against Wind! Can you hit[n]it?

[msg BTL_MES_006_120]
Electricity is effective! Exploit[n]that weakness!

[msg BTL_MES_006_121]
Going Nuclear is our best option![n]That's its weakness!

[msg BTL_MES_006_122]
Psychokinesis is effective. Take it[n]out before it goes psycho on US!

[msg BTL_MES_006_123]
Heavenly news! Attacks that Bless are[n]pretty effective against this one!

[msg BTL_MES_006_124]
Attacks with Curse are good bets for[n]this one!

[msg BTL_MES_006_125]
You're doing great, everybody!

[msg BTL_MES_006_126]
Go, go, go! Take them all down!

[msg BTL_MES_006_127]
Yeah! You can do it, guys!

[msg BTL_MES_006_128]
I'll just say it... you're all[n]uh-MAzing!

[msg BTL_MES_006_129]
You can use Baton Pass now!

[msg BTL_MES_006_130]
You could do some serious damage with[n]a Baton Pass!

[msg BTL_MES_006_131]
I'm ready to support at a moment's[n]notice!

[msg BTL_MES_006_132]
Let me know if there's anything I can[n]do to help!

[msg BTL_MES_006_133]
Let's go, everyone!

[msg BTL_MES_006_134]
Let's just get this over with!

[msg BTL_MES_006_135]
Wow! You're awesome, Senpai!

[msg BTL_MES_006_143]
That's it, Teddie!

[msg BTL_MES_006_144]
That was slick, Yukari-chan!

[msg BTL_MES_006_145]
Way to go, Junpei-san!

[msg BTL_MES_006_146]

You showed him, Shinjiro-san!

[msg BTL_MES_006_153]
Nice! You got 'im!

[msg BTL_MES_006_154]
Nice work, Joker!

You're on point, Panther!

[msg BTL_MES_006_157]

Let's take care of these Shadows.[n]Leave the support to me!

[msg BTL_MES_006_166]
We've gotta show him that he's[n]wrong... Let's go, guys!

[msg BTL_MES_006_167]
What!? Something's off about him.[n]Don't trust him, guys!

[msg BTL_MES_006_168]
Look out for his cronies in the back![n]Take them out first!

[msg BTL_MES_006_169]
Focus on his pals in the back first!

[msg BTL_MES_006_170]
I think we can take it now... Go[n]ahead and nab it, guys!

[msg BTL_MES_006_171]
We have to win! Do it for[n]Ribbon-chan!

[msg BTL_MES_006_172]
This world is so wrong... Well, give[n]it all you got, guys!

Something awful is happening to[n]him... Be careful, guys!

[msg BTL_MES_006_177]
Everyone, go for the eyes!

[msg BTL_MES_006_178]
Is that its weak spot? I say focus[n]your attacks there!

[msg BTL_MES_006_179]
No...! That wasn't its weak spot?

[msg BTL_MES_006_180]
This isn't good... What can we do...

[msg BTL_MES_006_181]
Hikari-chan's support... Maybe this[n]can turn things around!

[msg BTL_MES_006_182]
Yes, it's working!

We've come this far. There's no[n]backing out now!

[msg BTL_MES_006_185]
The enemy's affinity changed!

[msg BTL_MES_006_186]
A huge amount of power's building[n]up... We could be in big trouble!

[msg BTL_MES_006_187]
