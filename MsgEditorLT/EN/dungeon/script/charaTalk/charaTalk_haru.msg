Say, this is a place where we can gather[n]items! Want to take a look?

[msg MSG_001 [Haru]]
I think that's a wise decision.

[msg MSG_002 [Haru]]
I think you're right; let's focus on[n]gathering!

[msg MSG_003 [Haru]]
So we're passing on this one? I know[n]you've got your reasons.

[msg MSG_004 [Haru]]
Is that everything?

[msg MSG_005]
Oh?

[msg MSG_006]
Wow!

[msg MSG_007]
Hooray!

[msg MSG_008 [Haru]]
That was tough, and based on everyone's[n]faces, I think we should rest.

[msg MSG_009]
A rare one!

[msg MSG_010]
A great find!

[msg MSG_011]
*giggle* We're rocking this!

[msg MSG_012 [Haru]]
A shortcut! Should we hop on through?

[msg MSG_015 [Haru]]
Hm, a slight impediment... We can't go[n]through from this side.

こちらからは通れないようだ… (ショートカット未開通メッセージ（仮）)

[msg MSG_018 [Haru]]
This area's vibes aren't great; do you[n]think we'll be okay?

[msg MSG_019 [Haru]]
A-Are you sure? Okay, we can do this.

[msg MSG_020 [Haru]]
I'm glad you agree! There's no point in[n]throwing ourselves into danger!

[msg MSG_021 [Haru]]
I can't believe we actually made it! Is[n]everyone okay?

[msg MSG_022 [Haru]]
This place is just rife with Shadows,[n]no?

[msg MSG_023 [Haru]]
Yes. Let's keep our eyes on the prize.

[msg MSG_024 [Haru]]
True, no point in wandering straight[n]into danger.

[msg MSG_025 [Haru]]
So there were Shadows. Hopefully there[n]won't be more...

[msg MSG_026 [Haru]]
We could return to the theater from[n]here. What do you think?

[msg MSG_027]
Look out!
