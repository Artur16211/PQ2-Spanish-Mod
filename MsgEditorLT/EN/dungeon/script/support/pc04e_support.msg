[msg CAROLIN_FOE_FOLLOW_START]
You idiots, an FOE spotted you all!

[msg JUSTINE_FOE_FOLLOW_START]
It's the...

[msg CAROLIN_FOE_FOLLOW_START_2]
It's following you!

[msg JUSTINE_FOE_FOLLOW_START_2]
The FOE found you.

[msg CAROLIN_FOE_FOLLOW_START_3]
Hey, the FOE noticed you!

[msg JUSTINE_FOE_FOLLOW_START_3]
It is now pursuing you.

[msg CAROLIN_FOE_NEAR_1]
You better be careful!

[msg JUSTINE_FOE_NEAR_1]
The FOE is coming closer.

[msg CAROLIN_FOE_NEAR_2]
Don't get close if you're not willing[n]to fight it!

[msg JUSTINE_FOE_NEAR_2]
Please be aware that the FOE is[n]nearby.

[msg CAROLIN_FOE_NEAR_3]
An FOE's nearly on top of you!

[msg JUSTINE_FOE_NEAR_3]
Please proceed with caution.

[msg CAROLIN_FOE_FOLLOW_END_1]
Looks like the FOE gave up!

[msg JUSTINE_FOE_FOLLOW_END_1]
It looks like they can relax,[n]Caroline.

[msg CAROLIN_FOE_FOLLOW_END_2]
Good work, you got away!

[msg JUSTINE_FOE_FOLLOW_END_2]
The FOE stopped chasing you.

[msg CAROLIN_FOE_FOLLOW_END_3]
Huh? What happened to it?

[msg JUSTINE_FOE_FOLLOW_END_3]
It appears the FOE has ceased chasing[n]them, Caroline.

[msg CAROLIN_KANSI_REACTION_1]
Avoid those lights, got it!?

[msg JUSTINE_KANSI_REACTION_1]
Proceed without allowing any light to[n]illuminate you.

[msg CAROLIN_KANSI_REACTION_2]
Avoid them and you won't be seen! Got[n]that?

[msg JUSTINE_KANSI_REACTION_2]
Until you turn the switch off, avoid[n]the spotlights.

[msg CAROLIN_KANSI_REACTION_3]
とみ をよゎ ぼぺょ'ろ ろゎるょ ろめま ゅもむめろれ よみみデ ろめまょ ぺろ[n]ゅまぺれろ れろぺを みぺる ぺゐぺを みるよゆ ろめまゆ!

[msg JUSTINE_KANSI_REACTION_3]
Avoid them and you shan't be spotted.

[msg CAROLIN_DENKISAKU_REACTI]
If you don't want a nasty shock, look[n]for the switch!

[msg JUSTINE_DENKISAKU_REACTI]
Unless you impede the electricity,[n]you cannot proceed.

[msg CAROLIN_DENKISAKU_REACTI_2]
Look for the switch! It's gotta be[n]around there somewhere!

[msg JUSTINE_DENKISAKU_REACTI_2]
There is most likely a switch which[n]you can use to stop the electricity.

[msg CAROLIN_DENKISAKU_REACTI_3]
*chuckle* It's like our executions!

[msg JUSTINE_DENKISAKU_REACTI_3]
If you locate the switch, you will be[n]able to proceed.

[msg CAROLIN_KYOUHU_REACTION_]
Fascinating... Try moving with the[n]wind.

[msg JUSTINE_KYOUHU_REACTION_]
A mighty wind...!

[msg CAROLIN_KYOUHU_REACTION__2]
H-Hey!?

[msg JUSTINE_KYOUHU_REACTION__2]
Try using the wind to your advantage,[n]perhaps to augment your movement.

[msg CAROLIN_KYOUHU_REACTION__3]
I see all of your minds have been[n]blown!

[msg JUSTINE_KYOUHU_REACTION__3]
Are any of you struggling...?

[msg CAROLIN_STAIR_FIND_1]
Hey, Justine, you think that's a[n]staircase?

[msg JUSTINE_STAIR_FIND_1]
It appears to be one. Please confirm.

[msg CAROLIN_STAIR_FIND_2]
I found a staircase, Justine!

[msg JUSTINE_STAIR_FIND_2]
Excellent work, Caroline. I wouldn't[n]expect any less from you.

[msg CAROLIN_STAIR_FIND_3]
Hah, there we go! Now let's keep[n]going!

[msg JUSTINE_STAIR_FIND_3]
There appear to be stairs up ahead.

[msg CAROLIN_TREASURE_FIND_1]
Ooh, a treasure box! Hurry up and[n]open it!

[msg JUSTINE_TREASURE_FIND_1]
That must be a treasure box.

[msg CAROLIN_TREASURE_FIND_2]
Hey, is that a treasure box?

[msg JUSTINE_TREASURE_FIND_2]
What luck. You've stumbled upon a[n]treasure box.

[msg CAROLIN_TREASURE_FIND_3]
A treasure box! Aren't you gonna get[n]it!?

[msg JUSTINE_TREASURE_FIND_3]
That must be what others call[n]treasure.

[msg CAROLIN_CHECK_WALL_1]
Hey, check that area! There's[n]something there.

[msg JUSTINE_CHECK_WALL_1]
It is evident that there is something[n]interesting around there.

[msg CAROLIN_CHECK_WALL_2]
I sense there's something beneficial[n]to you around here!

[msg JUSTINE_CHECK_WALL_2]
I sense something in that area.

[msg CAROLIN_CHECK_WALL_3]
Get busy and search this area!

[msg JUSTINE_CHECK_WALL_3]
It may be wise to investigate the[n]area.

[msg CAROLIN_SWITCH_FIND_1]
Are you going to use that switch?

[msg JUSTINE_SWITCH_FIND_1]
That must be... some type of switch.

[msg CAROLIN_SWITCH_FIND_2]
Hey! There's a switch over there!

[msg JUSTINE_SWITCH_FIND_2]
Take note, there's a switch nearby.

[msg CAROLIN_SWITCH_FIND_3]
I found a switch!

[msg JUSTINE_SWITCH_FIND_3]
Something may change in this[n]environment if you use the switch.

[msg CAROLIN_SHORTCUT_FIND_1]
I'm sensing there's a wall you can go[n]through! Check around you!

[msg JUSTINE_SHORTCUT_FIND_1]
There may be a way for you to pass[n]through the nearby wall.

[msg CAROLIN_SHORTCUT_FIND_2]
You can probably go through that[n]wall!

[msg JUSTINE_SHORTCUT_FIND_2]
That wall is probably one you can[n]walk through.

[msg CAROLIN_SHORTCUT_FIND_3]
You should check that wall. It's a[n]shortcut candidate!

[msg JUSTINE_SHORTCUT_FIND_3]
Please check the nearby walls.

[msg CAROLIN_PARTY_DEAD_1]
H-Hurry up and get back to the[n]theater!

[msg JUSTINE_PARTY_DEAD_1]
Caroline... Do you think they'll be[n]okay...?

[msg CAROLIN_PARTY_DEAD_2]
Heal first! Then we'll talk!

[msg JUSTINE_PARTY_DEAD_2]
Just focus on healing.

[msg CAROLIN_PARTY_DEAD_3]
H-Hey! Are you guys all right!?

[msg JUSTINE_PARTY_DEAD_3]
Remember that returning is also an[n]option.

[msg CAROLIN_FOE_WARNING_NEAR]
That was an intense battle!

[msg JUSTINE_FOE_WARNING_NEAR]
The FOE is still pursuing you. Stay[n]alert, Caroline.

[msg CAROLIN_FOE_WARNING_NEAR_2]
The FOE is still coming after you!

[msg JUSTINE_FOE_WARNING_NEAR_2]
Continue to use caution.

[msg CAROLIN_FOE_WARNING_NEAR_3]
Don't let your guard down! Justine,[n]stay on the lookout!

[msg JUSTINE_FOE_WARNING_NEAR_3]
The FOE is continuing to stalk you.

[msg CAROLIN_PARTY_HPTP10_1]
Cancel the operation! Return to the[n]theater!

[msg JUSTINE_PARTY_HPTP10_1]
I can see that everyone has exhausted[n]their energy reserves.

[msg CAROLIN_PARTY_HPTP10_2]
Look at you lot! You're all barely[n]hanging on!

[msg JUSTINE_PARTY_HPTP10_2]
We should abort the operation.

[msg CAROLIN_PARTY_HPTP10_3]
Hey! Not one of you is looking good![n]Get back to the theater!

[msg JUSTINE_PARTY_HPTP10_3]
It's obvious that everyone is[n]fatigued.

[msg CAROLIN_PARTY_HP10_1]
Hey, you all are flagging! Take a[n]break!

[msg JUSTINE_PARTY_HP10_1]

[msg CAROLIN_PARTY_HP10_2]
Hurry up and heal!

[msg JUSTINE_PARTY_HP10_2]
I'm seeing the party's health is on a[n]steady decline.

[msg CAROLIN_PARTY_HP10_3]
You all need to patch yourselves up!

[msg JUSTINE_PARTY_HP10_3]
It may be best to pause and heal.

[msg CAROLIN_1PERSON_HPTP10_1]
You need a breather! Heal yourselves!

[msg JUSTINE_1PERSON_HPTP10_1]
Aren't you overtaxing yourself?

[msg CAROLIN_1PERSON_HPTP10_2]
Hurry up and heal!

[msg JUSTINE_1PERSON_HPTP10_2]
It looks like health and energy are[n]dangerously low.

[msg CAROLIN_1PERSON_HPTP10_3]
Looks like you've hit your limit.

[msg JUSTINE_1PERSON_HPTP10_3]
Please lend him a helping hand.

[msg CAROLIN_PARTY_TP10_1]
Hey! Watch your energy levels!

[msg JUSTINE_PARTY_TP10_1]
Caroline, we should let them rest.

[msg CAROLIN_PARTY_TP10_2]
Tch! You're right; they need it! I[n]order you all to come back!

[msg JUSTINE_PARTY_TP10_2]
They're all worn out... Let's have[n]them come back and rest, Caroline.

[msg CAROLIN_PARTY_TP10_3]
What happened to your energy!?

[msg JUSTINE_PARTY_TP10_3]

[msg CAROLIN_1PERSON_HP10_1]
Justine is right! Take a break!

[msg JUSTINE_1PERSON_HP10_1]
Inmate, your health is so low.[n]Perhaps a break is in order?

[msg CAROLIN_1PERSON_HP10_2]
Hurry up and heal!

[msg JUSTINE_1PERSON_HP10_2]
The prisoner's health is getting very[n]low.

[msg CAROLIN_1PERSON_HP10_3]
Hey! Reminder: that searing pain you[n]feel is your health going down!

[msg JUSTINE_1PERSON_HP10_3]
Please heal immediately.

[msg CAROLIN_1PERSON_TP10_1]
You better be grateful for Justine's[n]compassion!

[msg JUSTINE_1PERSON_TP10_1]
All signs point to exhaustion...

[msg CAROLIN_1PERSON_TP10_2]
You're out of energy!? Did you have[n]no plan at all!?

[msg JUSTINE_1PERSON_TP10_2]
Alas, they're running out of energy.

[msg CAROLIN_1PERSON_TP10_3]
Hey! Your energy's looking bad!

[msg JUSTINE_1PERSON_TP10_3]
They've been pushed to their limit.

[msg CAROLIN_ITEM_90_BATTLE_1]
Tsk, tsk, you greedy fool!

[msg JUSTINE_ITEM_90_BATTLE_1]
You have too many things.

[msg CAROLIN_ITEM_90_BATTLE_2]
You can't even organize your items!?

[msg JUSTINE_ITEM_90_BATTLE_2]
It would behoove you to be organized.

[msg CAROLIN_ITEM_90_BATTLE_3]
Have you lost track of how much you[n]have?

[msg JUSTINE_ITEM_90_BATTLE_3]
You have far too many things. I[n]recommend organizing them.

[msg CAROLIN_1PERSON_HP80_1]
Not a bad strategy.

[msg JUSTINE_1PERSON_HP80_1]
You're right, Caroline. It puts our[n]minds at ease, as well.

[msg CAROLIN_1PERSON_HP80_2]
Not bad, on to the next!

[msg JUSTINE_1PERSON_HP80_2]
That was a swell fight.

[msg CAROLIN_1PERSON_HP80_3]
Hurry on to the next one!

[msg JUSTINE_1PERSON_HP80_3]
It looks like you've still got some[n]fight in you.

You can't even organize your items!?

It would behoove you to be organized.

Have you lost track of how much you[n]have?

[msg JUSTINE_ITEM_90_DUNGEON__3]
You have far too many things. I[n]recommend organizing them.

[msg CAROLIN_DUNGEON_START_1]
We'll give you the information you[n]need.

[msg JUSTINE_DUNGEON_START_1]
So you are starting your exploration?

[msg CAROLIN_DUNGEON_START_2]
Time to get this investigation[n]underway!

[msg JUSTINE_DUNGEON_START_2]
Then we shall provide backup.

[msg CAROLIN_DUNGEON_START_3]
You didn't forget anything, did you?

[msg JUSTINE_DUNGEON_START_3]
Now, let us begin.

[msg CAROLIN_QUEST_START_1]
All right! Let's blow this hatch!

[msg JUSTINE_QUEST_START_1]
Let's get this special screening[n]underway.

[msg CAROLIN_QUEST_START_2]
We will now raise curtains on the[n]special screening!

[msg JUSTINE_QUEST_START_2]
We'll provide assistance until the[n]very end.

[msg CAROLIN_QUEST_START_3]
Fine, I guess we'll help you out!

[msg JUSTINE_QUEST_START_3]
Well then, let's get this started.

[msg CAROLIN_TOUHA_25_1]
We still have a long ways to go!

[msg JUSTINE_TOUHA_25_1]
This is only the beginning.

[msg CAROLIN_TOUHA_25_2]
We're not even halfway done! Don't[n]slack off!

[msg JUSTINE_TOUHA_25_2]
It seems you've made real progress on[n]the map.

[msg CAROLIN_TOUHA_50_1]
Hey! We've only got half the map[n]drawn!

[msg JUSTINE_TOUHA_50_1]
This must be about halfway...

[msg CAROLIN_TOUHA_50_2]
Finally we're halfway done. Not bad.

[msg JUSTINE_TOUHA_50_2]
I'd say you've finally reached the[n]halfway point.

[msg CAROLIN_TOUHA_75_1]
We're almost done with the whole[n]area! No time to rest!

[msg JUSTINE_TOUHA_75_1]
We only need to explore a bit further[n]to complete this floor.

[msg CAROLIN_TOUHA_75_2]
Just a little more, and then the[n]floor of this movie's a wrap!

[msg JUSTINE_TOUHA_75_2]
Just a little more until we complete[n]this floor.

[msg JUSTINE_TOUHA_100_1]
We completed the entire map. That's[n]an accomplishment.

[msg CAROLIN_TOUHA_100_2]
You know every nook and cranny now.

[msg JUSTINE_TOUHA_100_2]
We've explored every area of this[n]floor.

[msg CAROLIN_MAPPING_ICON_ALL]
Don't you have any sense of artistry?

[msg JUSTINE_MAPPING_ICON_ALL]
That's not bad.

[msg CAROLIN_MAPPING_ICON_ALL_2]
You're actually doing well with this[n]cartography business.

[msg JUSTINE_MAPPING_ICON_ALL_2]
Not bad for a prisoner.

[msg CAROLIN_MAPPING_ICON_KAI]
Not forgetting to draw the staircase.[n]I like that.

[msg JUSTINE_MAPPING_ICON_KAI_2]
You're going to mark the staircase,[n]yes?

[msg CAROLIN_MAPPING_CHANGE_C]
What kind of map are you drawing,[n]exactly!?

[msg JUSTINE_MAPPING_CHANGE_C]
I am interested in the final product[n]of all this mapping.

[msg CAROLIN_MAPPING_CHANGE_C_2]
Well, it's certainly an interesting[n]map.

[msg JUSTINE_MAPPING_CHANGE_C_2]
So that's the color you use.

[msg CAROLIN_MAPPING_ICON_DEL]
It's just like our rehabilitation of[n]you!

[msg JUSTINE_MAPPING_ICON_DEL]
Mistakes must be rectified.

[msg CAROLIN_MAPPING_ICON_DEL_2]
Why'd you draw it in the first place,[n]if you were just gonna erase it?

[msg JUSTINE_MAPPING_ICON_DEL_2]
Keeping the map clean is a good idea.

[msg CAROLIN_MAPPING_MEMO_1]
Hey! Don't forget about that memo!

[msg JUSTINE_MAPPING_MEMO_1]
Taking notes? Ah, you've probably had[n]some hard lessons in the past...

[msg CAROLIN_MAPPING_MEMO_2]
You better write it neatly!

[msg JUSTINE_MAPPING_MEMO_2]
Now we won't have to rely on our[n]oh-too-fickle memories.
