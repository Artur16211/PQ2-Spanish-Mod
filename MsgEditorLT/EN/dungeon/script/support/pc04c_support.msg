[msg THEODOR_FOE_FOLLOW_START]
Everyone, an FOE is pursuing you.

[msg THEODOR_FOE_FOLLOW_START_2]
Alas, it seems the FOE noticed you.

[msg THEODOR_FOE_FOLLOW_START_3]
Huh!? Oh, I beg you to be careful!

[msg THEODOR_FOE_NEAR_1]
Everyone, caution is required of you!

[msg THEODOR_FOE_NEAR_2]
Everyone, please note there is an[n]FOE!

[msg THEODOR_FOE_NEAR_3]
*gasp* This could prove disastrous.[n]Please be careful!

[msg THEODOR_FOE_FOLLOW_END_1]
It seems the FOE has lost its will to[n]harry you.

[msg THEODOR_FOE_FOLLOW_END_2]
Well done. I'm quite impressed.

[msg THEODOR_FOE_FOLLOW_END_3]
You've succeeded in putting distance[n]between you and the FOE.

[msg THEODOR_KANSI_REACTION_1]
You should proceed without allowing[n]exposure by the lights.

[msg THEODOR_KANSI_REACTION_2]
Keep going as quietly as possible.

[msg THEODOR_KANSI_REACTION_3]
Please avoid those lights.

[msg THEODOR_DENKISAKU_REACTI]
You won't be able to proceed unless[n]you stop its current.

[msg THEODOR_DENKISAKU_REACTI_2]
There must be a switch thereabouts...

[msg THEODOR_DENKISAKU_REACTI_3]

[msg THEODOR_KYOUHU_REACTION_]
Beware the gusts of wind!

[msg THEODOR_KYOUHU_REACTION__2]
Why, perhaps you could ride the wind?

[msg THEODOR_KYOUHU_REACTION__3]
Oh! Such a terrible gale!

[msg THEODOR_STAIR_FIND_1]
Sister, I do believe the stairs are[n]just up ahead...

[msg THEODOR_STAIR_FIND_2]
Yes, those are stairs!

[msg THEODOR_STAIR_FIND_3]
Impressive, Sister. You have such[n]keen powers of observation.

[msg THEODOR_TREASURE_FIND_1]
A reward in the form of a treasure[n]box!

[msg THEODOR_TREASURE_FIND_2]
I'm quite curious as to the contents[n]of the treasure box.

[msg THEODOR_TREASURE_FIND_3]
Ah, a treasure box. I must say I'm[n]excited to see what's inside.

[msg THEODOR_CHECK_WALL_1]
Oh, there's something intriguing over[n]there!

[msg THEODOR_CHECK_WALL_2]
What's that? Would you see about it?

[msg THEODOR_CHECK_WALL_3]
I believe there is something nearby.

[msg THEODOR_SWITCH_FIND_1]
There's a switch. What will we do?

[msg THEODOR_SWITCH_FIND_2]
Shall we try pressing that switch?

[msg THEODOR_SWITCH_FIND_3]
It seems that is a switch over there.

[msg THEODOR_SHORTCUT_FIND_1]
This wall... I feel there's more to[n]it than meets the eye.

[msg THEODOR_SHORTCUT_FIND_2]
Why don't we check that wall there?

[msg THEODOR_SHORTCUT_FIND_3]
There may be unknown properties about[n]the wall up ahead.

[msg THEODOR_PARTY_DEAD_1]
E-Everyone!? Are you all right!?

[msg THEODOR_PARTY_DEAD_2]
Please consider returning here.

[msg THEODOR_PARTY_DEAD_3]
You should first heal yourselves.

[msg THEODOR_FOE_WARNING_NEAR]
The FOE is still quite determined to[n]catch you, I'm afraid.

[msg THEODOR_FOE_WARNING_NEAR_2]
It just won't give up...

[msg THEODOR_FOE_WARNING_NEAR_3]
Everyone, please use as much caution[n]as you can manage.

[msg THEODOR_PARTY_HPTP10_1]
Sister, please calm down. They just[n]need to regroup and heal themselves.

[msg THEODOR_PARTY_HPTP10_2]
I'm concerned about your levels of[n]exhaustion. You should return.

[msg THEODOR_PARTY_HPTP10_3]
It seems my sister wishes for you to[n]return.

[msg THEODOR_PARTY_HP10_1]
Everyone's health is rather depleted.

[msg THEODOR_PARTY_HP10_2]
You should consider healing[n]immediately.

[msg THEODOR_PARTY_HP10_3]
Please prioritize healing your[n]wounds.

[msg THEODOR_1PERSON_HPTP10_1]
Aren't your health and stamina[n]running quite low?

[msg THEODOR_1PERSON_HPTP10_2]
Why not heal yourself at this time?

[msg THEODOR_1PERSON_HPTP10_3]
とろ れままゆれ をよゎ'るま ほぺるまゅを ぺほゅま ろよ れろぺょぽテテテ[n]はまるめぺられ をよゎ れめよゎゅぽ めまぺゅ をよゎるれまゅみ?

[msg THEODOR_PARTY_TP10_1]
Everyone's energy is running low...[n]Do you want to address that?

[msg THEODOR_PARTY_TP10_2]
You should change your strategy due[n]to your declining energy.

[msg THEODOR_PARTY_TP10_3]
Well said, Sister! That is wonderful[n]advice!

[msg THEODOR_1PERSON_HP10_1]
Please be cautious about your health.

[msg THEODOR_1PERSON_HP10_2]
I ask that you first heal yourself.

[msg THEODOR_1PERSON_HP10_3]
Are you stable in regards to your[n]health?

[msg THEODOR_1PERSON_TP10_1]
I suggest that you change your battle[n]tactics.

[msg THEODOR_1PERSON_TP10_2]
Do you have enough energy to pull[n]through this?

[msg THEODOR_1PERSON_TP10_3]
Have you addressed your energy needs?

[msg THEODOR_ITEM_90_BATTLE_1]
Sister!? Did you toss out my[n]treasured possessions!?

[msg THEODOR_ITEM_90_BATTLE_2]
Isn't your inventory a bit full?

[msg THEODOR_ITEM_90_BATTLE_3]
Please come by my shop if you need to[n]sort through your belongings.

[msg THEODOR_1PERSON_HP80_1]
Everyone, amazing work, truly!

[msg THEODOR_1PERSON_HP80_2]
S-Sister!? Please refrain from[n]flailing your arms like that!

[msg THEODOR_1PERSON_HP80_3]
Sister? Perhaps it's best if you keep[n]your dance of joy to yourself...

Isn't your inventory a bit full?

[msg THEODOR_ITEM_90_DUNGEON__3]
Please come by my shop if you need to[n]sort through your belongings.

[msg THEODOR_DUNGEON_START_1]
...And me, Th-Theodore, who will act[n]as your navigators.

[msg THEODOR_DUNGEON_START_2]
And her brother, Theodore. Please go[n]easy on us.

[msg THEODOR_DUNGEON_START_3]
Well then, let's begin our[n]exploration.

[msg THEODOR_QUEST_START_1]
The special screening has begun.

[msg THEODOR_QUEST_START_2]
My sister and I will accompany you[n]through to its finale.

[msg THEODOR_QUEST_START_3]
Shall we begin?

[msg THEODOR_TOUHA_25_1]
Looks like you've only just begun[n]traversing this floor.

[msg THEODOR_TOUHA_25_2]
There's probably more to come.

[msg THEODOR_TOUHA_50_1]
How fortuitous... You've reached the[n]halfway point.

[msg THEODOR_TOUHA_50_2]
You've made it halfway. You are[n]clearly the right ones for this job.

[msg THEODOR_TOUHA_75_1]
Only a smidgen of unexplored floor[n]remains.

[msg THEODOR_TOUHA_75_2]
A teensy bit more and this map is[n]complete!

[msg THEODOR_TOUHA_100_1]
Amazing! The map is complete!

[msg THEODOR_TOUHA_100_2]
The map is complete. You've done[n]well.

[msg THEODOR_MAPPING_ICON_ALL]
You're drawing the map quite[n]precisely.

[msg THEODOR_MAPPING_ICON_ALL_2]
Sister... Is that true...?

[msg THEODOR_MAPPING_ICON_KAI]
You have an excellent grasp of where[n]the stairs are.

[msg THEODOR_MAPPING_ICON_KAI_2]
Huh!? Sister, I haven't prepared[n]anything of the sort!

[msg THEODOR_MAPPING_CHANGE_C]
What amazing artistic taste.

[msg THEODOR_MAPPING_CHANGE_C_2]
I look forward to seeing the map in[n]its final, glorious incarnation.

[msg THEODOR_MAPPING_ICON_DEL]
Sister!? You intend on discarding[n]me!?

[msg THEODOR_MAPPING_ICON_DEL_2]
It's always best to go back and right[n]one's mistakes.

[msg THEODOR_MAPPING_MEMO_1]
That attention to detail is splendid.

[msg THEODOR_MAPPING_MEMO_2]
Ah, good, you're noting it down.

[msg THEODOR_KARITORU_ENCOUNT]
I wish this wasn't true, but there's[n]a Reaper coming!

[msg THEODOR_KARITORU_ENCOUNT_2]
A Reaper is gravitating toward you.[n]Please take care!

[msg THEODOR_KARITORU_ENCOUNT_3]
I'm sensing something, and it's most[n]certainly a Reaper!
