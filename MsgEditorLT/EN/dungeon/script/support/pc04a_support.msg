You've been splendidly locked onto.

[msg ELIZABETH_FOE_FOLLOW_STA_2]
I would say this is an emergency.

[msg THEODOR_FOE_FOLLOW_START_2]
Alas, it seems the FOE noticed you.

[msg ELIZABETH_FOE_FOLLOW_STA_3]
Oh dear, an FOE is tailing you...[n]Theo, I leave this to you.

[msg THEODOR_FOE_FOLLOW_START_3]
Huh!? Oh, I beg you to be careful!

[msg ELIZABETH_FOE_NEAR_1]
There is an FOE in proximity to you.

[msg THEODOR_FOE_NEAR_1]
Everyone, caution is required of you!

[msg ELIZABETH_FOE_NEAR_2]
I'm formally announcing the near[n]presence of an FOE.

[msg THEODOR_FOE_NEAR_2]
Everyone, please note there is an[n]FOE!

[msg ELIZABETH_FOE_NEAR_3]
An FOE reading, loud and clear. I[n]propose you not be loud, nor clear.

[msg THEODOR_FOE_NEAR_3]
*gasp* This could prove disastrous.[n]Please be careful!

[msg ELIZABETH_FOE_FOLLOW_END]
That was an impressive display of[n]running away.

[msg THEODOR_FOE_FOLLOW_END_1]
It seems the FOE has lost its will to[n]harry you.

[msg ELIZABETH_FOE_FOLLOW_END_2]
The FOE's given up its pursuit.[n]Coward.

[msg THEODOR_FOE_FOLLOW_END_2]
Well done. I'm quite impressed.

[msg ELIZABETH_FOE_FOLLOW_END_3]
I'm lifting the emergency alert.

[msg THEODOR_FOE_FOLLOW_END_3]
You've succeeded in putting distance[n]between you and the FOE.

[msg ELIZABETH_KANSI_REACTION]
You should proceed without allowing[n]yourselves to be illuminated.

[msg THEODOR_KANSI_REACTION_1]
You should proceed without allowing[n]exposure by the lights.

[msg ELIZABETH_KANSI_REACTION_2]
Please tippy-toe through here, as I'd[n]prefer not to worry about you all.

[msg THEODOR_KANSI_REACTION_2]
Keep going as quietly as possible.

[msg ELIZABETH_KANSI_REACTION_3]
Avoid the lights, and no one will see[n]you.

[msg THEODOR_KANSI_REACTION_3]
Please avoid those lights.

[msg ELIZABETH_DENKISAKU_REAC]
Could this be... a training device!?

[msg THEODOR_DENKISAKU_REACTI]
You won't be able to proceed unless[n]you stop its current.

[msg ELIZABETH_DENKISAKU_REAC_2]
Locate the switch to turn off the[n]power.

[msg THEODOR_DENKISAKU_REACTI_2]
There must be a switch thereabouts...

[msg ELIZABETH_DENKISAKU_REAC_3]
My, what could the voltage be on that[n]apparatus?

[msg THEODOR_DENKISAKU_REACTI_3]

[msg ELIZABETH_KYOUHU_REACTIO]
Whoosh goes my skirt! Well, that's a[n]little something special for you.

[msg THEODOR_KYOUHU_REACTION_]
Beware the gusts of wind!

[msg ELIZABETH_KYOUHU_REACTIO_2]
Where you land is dependent on the[n]wind.

[msg THEODOR_KYOUHU_REACTION__2]
Why, perhaps you could ride the wind?

[msg ELIZABETH_KYOUHU_REACTIO_3]
Ohhh noooooo.

[msg THEODOR_KYOUHU_REACTION__3]
Oh! Such a terrible gale!

[msg ELIZABETH_STAIR_FIND_1]
Please look to the right. You will[n]see the stairs.

[msg THEODOR_STAIR_FIND_1]
Sister, I do believe the stairs are[n]just up ahead...

[msg ELIZABETH_STAIR_FIND_2]
Let us head on up, and perhaps also[n]head on down.

[msg THEODOR_STAIR_FIND_2]
Yes, those are stairs!

[msg ELIZABETH_STAIR_FIND_3]
Most excellent, I see stairs.

[msg THEODOR_STAIR_FIND_3]
Impressive, Sister. You have such[n]keen powers of observation.

[msg ELIZABETH_TREASURE_FIND_]
I've confirmed a treasure box up[n]ahead.

[msg THEODOR_TREASURE_FIND_1]
A reward in the form of a treasure[n]box!

[msg ELIZABETH_TREASURE_FIND__2]
Could that be what is called a[n]Treasure?

[msg THEODOR_TREASURE_FIND_2]
I'm quite curious as to the contents[n]of the treasure box.

[msg ELIZABETH_TREASURE_FIND__3]
My personal wish is for that treasure[n]box to contain chips or takoyaki.

[msg THEODOR_TREASURE_FIND_3]
Ah, a treasure box. I must say I'm[n]excited to see what's inside.

[msg ELIZABETH_CHECK_WALL_1]
It feels as if something is nearby...

[msg THEODOR_CHECK_WALL_1]
Oh, there's something intriguing over[n]there!

[msg ELIZABETH_CHECK_WALL_2]
There's something here that catches[n]my fancy.

[msg THEODOR_CHECK_WALL_2]
What's that? Would you see about it?

[msg ELIZABETH_CHECK_WALL_3]
I've sensed something. Yes,[n]definitely.

[msg THEODOR_CHECK_WALL_3]
I believe there is something nearby.

[msg ELIZABETH_SWITCH_FIND_1]
A switch is confirmed present.

[msg THEODOR_SWITCH_FIND_1]
There's a switch. What will you do?

[msg ELIZABETH_SWITCH_FIND_2]
Yonder is a switch.

[msg THEODOR_SWITCH_FIND_2]
Will you press that switch?

[msg ELIZABETH_SWITCH_FIND_3]
There's only one question in this[n]situation. Will you use the switch?

[msg THEODOR_SWITCH_FIND_3]
It seems that is a switch over there.

[msg ELIZABETH_SHORTCUT_FIND_]
It should be possible for you to slip[n]right through a nearby wall.

[msg THEODOR_SHORTCUT_FIND_1]
This wall... I feel there's more to[n]it than meets the eye.

[msg ELIZABETH_SHORTCUT_FIND__2]
ぬをデ ろめぺろ ゐぺゅゅテテテ とろ れゆまゅゅれ わまるを れゎれらもぼもよゎれデ[n]もみ ろめぺろ もれ ろめま るもむめろ わまるほテ

[msg THEODOR_SHORTCUT_FIND_2]
Why don't you check that wall there?

[msg ELIZABETH_SHORTCUT_FIND__3]
My senses are saying there is a[n]passable wall nearby.

[msg THEODOR_SHORTCUT_FIND_3]
There may be unknown properties about[n]the wall up ahead.

[msg ELIZABETH_PARTY_DEAD_1]
Oh dear... Perhaps we ought to pray,[n]Theo, not much else we can do.

[msg THEODOR_PARTY_DEAD_1]
Everyone!? Are you all right!?

[msg ELIZABETH_PARTY_DEAD_2]
I recommend that you regroup at once.

[msg THEODOR_PARTY_DEAD_2]
Please consider returning here.

[msg ELIZABETH_PARTY_DEAD_3]
As they say, slow and steady wins the[n]race.

[msg THEODOR_PARTY_DEAD_3]
You should first heal yourselves.

[msg ELIZABETH_FOE_WARNING_NE]
You may wish to be cautious while[n]entering battle, for the time being.

[msg THEODOR_FOE_WARNING_NEAR]
The FOE is still chasing you.

[msg ELIZABETH_FOE_WARNING_NE_2]
Well then, an FOE is in pursuit now.

[msg THEODOR_FOE_WARNING_NEAR_2]
It just won't give up, will it...

[msg ELIZABETH_FOE_WARNING_NE_3]
It seems the FOE is continuing its[n]pursuit of you...

[msg THEODOR_FOE_WARNING_NEAR_3]
Everyone, please use as much caution[n]as you can manage.

[msg ELIZABETH_PARTY_HPTP10_1]
Oh dear! Th-This is a state of[n]emergency.

[msg THEODOR_PARTY_HPTP10_1]
Sister, please calm down. They just[n]need to regroup and heal themselves.

[msg ELIZABETH_PARTY_HPTP10_2]
Theo, you must prepare to welcome[n]them back.

[msg THEODOR_PARTY_HPTP10_2]
I'm concerned about your levels of[n]exhaustion. You should return.

[msg ELIZABETH_PARTY_HPTP10_3]
It seems everyone's strength has[n]reached its own eccentric limit.

[msg THEODOR_PARTY_HPTP10_3]
It seems my sister wishes for you to[n]return.

[msg ELIZABETH_PARTY_HP10_1]
My... Perhaps a return is in order?

[msg THEODOR_PARTY_HP10_1]
Everyone's health is rather depleted.

[msg ELIZABETH_PARTY_HP10_2]
Everyone's health is abysmal!

[msg THEODOR_PARTY_HP10_2]
You should consider healing[n]immediately.

[msg ELIZABETH_PARTY_HP10_3]
Everyone's health level is as tiny a[n]drop as the tear of a sparrow.

[msg THEODOR_PARTY_HP10_3]
Please prioritize healing your[n]wounds.

[msg ELIZABETH_1PERSON_HPTP10]
Healing! Someone provide healing!

[msg THEODOR_1PERSON_HPTP10_1]
Aren't your health and stamina[n]running quite low?

[msg ELIZABETH_1PERSON_HPTP10_2]
It seems you are at your limits in[n]both health and stamina...

[msg THEODOR_1PERSON_HPTP10_2]
Why don't you at least heal your[n]health?

[msg ELIZABETH_1PERSON_HPTP10_3]
Support will be offered upon your[n]return... Theo will take care of you.

[msg THEODOR_1PERSON_HPTP10_3]

[msg ELIZABETH_PARTY_TP10_1]
To be honest, it may be best to just[n]hurry on back...

[msg THEODOR_PARTY_TP10_1]
Everyone's energy is running low...[n]Do you want to address that?

[msg ELIZABETH_PARTY_TP10_2]

[msg THEODOR_PARTY_TP10_2]
You should change your strategy due[n]to your declining energy.

[msg ELIZABETH_PARTY_TP10_3]
You should save the remainder of your[n]energy for returning here.

[msg THEODOR_PARTY_TP10_3]
Well said, Sister! That is wonderful[n]advice!

[msg ELIZABETH_1PERSON_HP10_1]
Pushing yourself any further is[n]reckless. Please restore your health.

[msg THEODOR_1PERSON_HP10_1]
Please be cautious about your health.

[msg ELIZABETH_1PERSON_HP10_2]
Your health is of concern... Please[n]do not push yourself too hard.

[msg THEODOR_1PERSON_HP10_2]
I ask that you first heal yourself.

[msg ELIZABETH_1PERSON_HP10_3]
They aren't that weak, Theo. I hope.

[msg THEODOR_1PERSON_HP10_3]
Are you stable in regards to your[n]health?

[msg ELIZABETH_1PERSON_TP10_1]
Your energy has hit its limit. It's[n]quite obvious.

[msg THEODOR_1PERSON_TP10_1]
I suggest that you change your battle[n]tactics.

[msg ELIZABETH_1PERSON_TP10_2]
Theo, let's leave the decision to[n]them.

[msg THEODOR_1PERSON_TP10_2]
Do you have enough energy to pull[n]through this?

[msg ELIZABETH_1PERSON_TP10_3]
Get up! Get back up! That is how one[n]encourages someone else, yes?

[msg THEODOR_1PERSON_TP10_3]
Have you addressed your energy needs?

[msg ELIZABETH_ITEM_90_BATTLE]
Items that you cannot hold onto[n]should be tossed away, faaaar away.

[msg THEODOR_ITEM_90_BATTLE_1]
Sister!? Did you toss out my[n]treasured possessions!?

[msg THEODOR_ITEM_90_BATTLE_2]
Isn't your inventory a bit full?

[msg ELIZABETH_ITEM_90_BATTLE_3]
My, you're running out of inventory[n]space quickly.

[msg THEODOR_ITEM_90_BATTLE_3]
Please come by my shop if you need to[n]sort through your belongings.

[msg ELIZABETH_1PERSON_HP80_1]
They are truly, how do you say, ON A[n]ROLL.

[msg THEODOR_1PERSON_HP80_1]
Everyone, amazing work, truly!

[msg ELIZABETH_1PERSON_HP80_2]
Please continue onward, as in a[n]"one-two punch."

[msg THEODOR_1PERSON_HP80_2]
S-Sister!? Please refrain from[n]flailing your arms like that!

[msg ELIZABETH_1PERSON_HP80_3]
Woohoo! Well done!

[msg THEODOR_1PERSON_HP80_3]
Sister? Perhaps it's best if you keep[n]your dance of joy to yourself...

...And me, Th-Theodore, who will act[n]as your navigators.

Today, your guide will be myself,[n]Elizabeth...

[msg THEODOR_DUNGEON_START_2]
And her brother, Theodore. Please go[n]easy on us.

[msg ELIZABETH_DUNGEON_START__3]
Here comes Elizabeeeeeth!

[msg THEODOR_DUNGEON_START_3]
Well then, let's begin our[n]exploration.

[msg ELIZABETH_QUEST_START_1]
Let’s resolve this quickly.

[msg THEODOR_QUEST_START_1]
The special screening has begun.

[msg ELIZABETH_QUEST_START_2]
Let's begin the special screening.[n]Roll film!

[msg THEODOR_QUEST_START_2]
My sister and I will accompany you[n]through to its finale.

[msg ELIZABETH_QUEST_START_3]
Bring it on, as they say. I shall be[n]the greatest navigator of all time.

[msg THEODOR_QUEST_START_3]
Well then, let's get this started.

[msg ELIZABETH_TOUHA_25_1]
Your journey ahead is still long and[n]arduous. Hang in there, as they say.

[msg THEODOR_TOUHA_25_1]
Looks like you've only just begun[n]traversing this floor.

[msg ELIZABETH_TOUHA_25_2]
This floor is still new to you.

[msg THEODOR_TOUHA_25_2]
It seems there is much more to come.

[msg ELIZABETH_TOUHA_50_1]
I suppose one could say that you’ve[n]reached the halfway mark.

[msg THEODOR_TOUHA_50_1]
You finally reached the halfway[n]point.

[msg ELIZABETH_TOUHA_50_2]
Only half left to go. Remember our[n]original purpose and push forward.

[msg THEODOR_TOUHA_50_2]
You've made it halfway. Well, I can't[n]ask for more than your best.

[msg THEODOR_TOUHA_75_1]
Only a bit remains unexplored.

[msg ELIZABETH_TOUHA_75_2]
Just a little more, and you’ve fully[n]traversed this floor.

[msg THEODOR_TOUHA_75_2]
A teensy bit more and this map is[n]complete!

Well done, you’ve mastered this[n]floor.

[msg THEODOR_TOUHA_100_2]
The map is complete. You've done[n]well.

[msg ELIZABETH_MAPPING_ICON_A]
You're truly a master cartographer.

Well done! Now you won’t be lost.

[msg THEODOR_MAPPING_ICON_KAI]
You have an excellent grasp of where[n]the stairs are.

[msg ELIZABETH_MAPPING_ICON_K_2]
Corrrrrect! Theo, bring out the prize[n]for accurate placement!

[msg THEODOR_MAPPING_ICON_KAI_2]
Huh!? Sister, I haven't prepared[n]anything of the sort!

[msg ELIZABETH_MAPPING_CHANGE]
So you’re using that color... That is[n]hip, as they say.

[msg THEODOR_MAPPING_CHANGE_C]
What amazing artistic taste.

[msg ELIZABETH_MAPPING_CHANGE_2]
My pound is hearting in wonder at how[n]this map will turn out.

[msg THEODOR_MAPPING_CHANGE_C_2]
I look forward to seeing the map in[n]its final, glorious incarnation.

[msg ELIZABETH_MAPPING_ICON_D]
Things that get in the way should be[n]tossed away! ...Kind of like Theo.

[msg THEODOR_MAPPING_ICON_DEL]
Sister!? You intend on discarding[n]me!?

[msg ELIZABETH_MAPPING_ICON_D_2]
Then, can my theft of Theo's snack be[n]righted as well...?

[msg THEODOR_MAPPING_MEMO_1]
That attention to detail is splendid.
