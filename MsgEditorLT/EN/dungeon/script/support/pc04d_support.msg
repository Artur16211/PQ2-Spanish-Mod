[msg MARGARET_FOE_FOLLOW_STAR]
That's... a Film Ob...

[msg NANAKO_FOE_FOLLOW_START_]
F-O-E!

[msg MARGARET_FOE_FOLLOW_STAR_2]
There is an FOE in pursuit.

[msg NANAKO_FOE_FOLLOW_START__2]
Watch out, everybody!

[msg MARGARET_FOE_FOLLOW_STAR_3]
You are being followed.

[msg NANAKO_FOE_FOLLOW_START__3]
Oh! F-O-E! F-O-E!

[msg MARGARET_FOE_NEAR_1]
Stay calm, it's an FOE.

[msg NANAKO_FOE_NEAR_1]
*gasp* Wha...!?

[msg MARGARET_FOE_NEAR_2]
It is quite large, but of course,[n]everything looks large to you.

[msg NANAKO_FOE_NEAR_2]
*gasp!* That's a huge one!

[msg MARGARET_FOE_NEAR_3]
Be warned that there is an FOE[n]nearby.

[msg NANAKO_FOE_NEAR_3]
Eeek! It's really close!

[msg MARGARET_FOE_FOLLOW_END_]
Well done. You've evaded the FOE.

[msg NANAKO_FOE_FOLLOW_END_1]
That was scary.

[msg MARGARET_FOE_FOLLOW_END__2]
Your escape was a successful one.

[msg NANAKO_FOE_FOLLOW_END_2]
Oh, the F-O-E is gone now.

[msg MARGARET_FOE_FOLLOW_END__3]
Thankfully, it gave up its pursuit of[n]you.

[msg NANAKO_FOE_FOLLOW_END_3]
The F-O-E's gone? Are we safe now?

[msg MARGARET_KANSI_REACTION_]
If those lights manage to touch you,[n]you'll most certainly be seen.

[msg NANAKO_KANSI_REACTION_1]
If you step into one, they'll see[n]you!

[msg MARGARET_KANSI_REACTION__2]
Spotlights have been set up here.

[msg NANAKO_KANSI_REACTION_2]
Be sneaky so they can't find you!

[msg MARGARET_KANSI_REACTION__3]
Exercise caution once you're past[n]here.

[msg NANAKO_KANSI_REACTION_3]
It's like hide-and-seek! You have to[n]not let let them find you!

[msg MARGARET_DENKISAKU_REACT]
To continue, it will be necessary to[n]deactivate the electric gate.

[msg NANAKO_DENKISAKU_REACTIO]
It's all zappy... Can we turn it off?

[msg MARGARET_DENKISAKU_REACT_2]
That gate is an unfortunate obstacle.

[msg NANAKO_DENKISAKU_REACTIO_2]
Look out! Don't get shocked!

[msg MARGARET_DENKISAKU_REACT_3]

[msg NANAKO_DENKISAKU_REACTIO_3]
Is there a switch to turn off the[n]zapping?

[msg MARGARET_KYOUHU_REACTION]
What a strong wind.

[msg NANAKO_KYOUHU_REACTION_1]
*gasp!* Are you being blown around?

[msg MARGARET_KYOUHU_REACTION_2]
Mind your footing, everyone.

[msg NANAKO_KYOUHU_REACTION_2]
The wind is soooo strong!

[msg MARGARET_KYOUHU_REACTION_3]
That's quite a breeze!

[msg NANAKO_KYOUHU_REACTION_3]
*gasp* We flew!

[msg MARGARET_STAIR_FIND_1]
Well done. You've found the stairs.

[msg NANAKO_STAIR_FIND_1]
Yaaay! Are you moving on?

[msg MARGARET_STAIR_FIND_2]
Remarkable progress. Now, are you[n]ready to go further?

[msg NANAKO_STAIR_FIND_2]
Oh! I love this game! I spy, with my[n]little eye, a staircase!

[msg MARGARET_STAIR_FIND_3]
At last, you've located the stairs.

[msg NANAKO_STAIR_FIND_3]
There's where the stairs are!

[msg MARGARET_TREASURE_FIND_1]
That appears to be a treasure box.[n]You plan on opening it, I hope?

[msg NANAKO_TREASURE_FIND_1]
Ooh, a treasure box! What's in it?

[msg MARGARET_TREASURE_FIND_2]
Oh, a treasure box. What could be[n]inside, I wonder?

[msg NANAKO_TREASURE_FIND_2]
Wow, you found a real treasure box!

[msg MARGARET_TREASURE_FIND_3]

[msg NANAKO_TREASURE_FIND_3]
I see some treasure!

[msg MARGARET_CHECK_WALL_1]
You may very well wish to take a[n]closer look there.

[msg NANAKO_CHECK_WALL_1]
What's that right there?

[msg MARGARET_CHECK_WALL_2]
Hm, what could that be?

[msg NANAKO_CHECK_WALL_2]
...Huh? What's that?

[msg MARGARET_CHECK_WALL_3]
I cannot discern what it is, but[n]there is something ahead.

[msg NANAKO_CHECK_WALL_3]
Hey, there's something here.

[msg MARGARET_SWITCH_FIND_1]
There is a switch up ahead.

[msg NANAKO_SWITCH_FIND_1]
Ooh, a switch! Can I touch it?

[msg MARGARET_SWITCH_FIND_2]
I wager there is a switch nearby.

[msg NANAKO_SWITCH_FIND_2]
Switchy, switchy!

[msg MARGARET_SWITCH_FIND_3]
Do you think you should see what this[n]switch does?

[msg NANAKO_SWITCH_FIND_3]
You're gonna use the switch? You[n]sure?

[msg MARGARET_SHORTCUT_FIND_1]
That wall is a traversable one.

[msg NANAKO_SHORTCUT_FIND_1]
You can walk right through that wall!

[msg MARGARET_SHORTCUT_FIND_2]
There is a hidden passage in the[n]vicinity.

[msg NANAKO_SHORTCUT_FIND_2]
Hey, look at that wall over there!

[msg MARGARET_SHORTCUT_FIND_3]
That wall... There is something[n]significant about it.

[msg NANAKO_SHORTCUT_FIND_3]
That wall looks weird.

[msg MARGARET_PARTY_DEAD_1]
You're undeniably very injured.

[msg NANAKO_PARTY_DEAD_1]
You don't look okay. Come back to the[n]movie theater!

[msg MARGARET_PARTY_DEAD_2]
I agree. Perhaps you should head back[n]for now?

[msg NANAKO_PARTY_DEAD_2]
It's too dangerous to keep going!

[msg MARGARET_PARTY_DEAD_3]
I can't recommend proceeding any[n]further.

[msg NANAKO_PARTY_DEAD_3]
I'm worried about everybody...

[msg MARGARET_FOE_WARNING_NEA]
The FOE is back. You should remain[n]alert.

[msg NANAKO_FOE_WARNING_NEAR_]
Leave us alone!

[msg MARGARET_FOE_WARNING_NEA_2]
That is correct, so best keep an eye[n]on your surroundings.

[msg NANAKO_FOE_WARNING_NEAR__2]
The F-O-E is still here!

[msg MARGARET_FOE_WARNING_NEA_3]
An FOE is coming near. Be on guard.

[msg NANAKO_FOE_WARNING_NEAR__3]
We need to do our best!

[msg MARGARET_PARTY_HPTP10_1]
I suggest you withdraw for now.

[msg NANAKO_PARTY_HPTP10_1]
Yeah, let's go back!

[msg MARGARET_PARTY_HPTP10_2]
Unfortunately, the whole team is on[n]the verge of collapse...

[msg NANAKO_PARTY_HPTP10_2]
I don't want you to lose!

[msg MARGARET_PARTY_HPTP10_3]
Yes, it would be unwise to proceed[n]any further as is.

[msg NANAKO_PARTY_HPTP10_3]
Are you okay!? Should we go back?

[msg MARGARET_PARTY_HP10_1]
Everyone's health is fast approaching[n]a dangerous level.

[msg NANAKO_PARTY_HP10_1]
Don't try too hard. That's what my[n]teacher said!

[msg MARGARET_PARTY_HP10_2]
Truly, you should take a look at the[n]health of your party.

[msg NANAKO_PARTY_HP10_2]
Let's take a nap, everybody!

[msg MARGARET_PARTY_HP10_3]
You should make healing everyone your[n]first priority.

[msg NANAKO_PARTY_HP10_3]
Everybody looks so beat up...

[msg MARGARET_1PERSON_HPTP10_]
Your health and energy are woefully[n]depleted.

[msg NANAKO_1PERSON_HPTP10_1]
Oh no... I'm scared for everyone...

[msg MARGARET_1PERSON_HPTP10__2]
Healing really ought to be your first[n]order of business.

[msg NANAKO_1PERSON_HPTP10_2]
Y-You need to heal before it's too[n]late!

[msg MARGARET_1PERSON_HPTP10__3]
Alas, you've lost significant health[n]and energy.

[msg NANAKO_1PERSON_HPTP10_3]
*gasp* Someone help!

[msg MARGARET_PARTY_TP10_1]
There's a dearth of energy in the[n]party.

[msg NANAKO_PARTY_TP10_1]
Why does everyone look so tired?

[msg MARGARET_PARTY_TP10_2]
I'm growing concerned about your[n]large losses of energy.

[msg NANAKO_PARTY_TP10_2]
You're still gonna keep going...?

[msg MARGARET_PARTY_TP10_3]
It would seem the party is suffering[n]a lack of energy.

[msg NANAKO_PARTY_TP10_3]
Maybe you should go back?

[msg MARGARET_1PERSON_HP10_1]
You should prioritize healing[n]yourself.

[msg NANAKO_1PERSON_HP10_1]
You're gonna lose if you keep going!

[msg MARGARET_1PERSON_HP10_2]
May I suggest restoring your health?

[msg NANAKO_1PERSON_HP10_2]
Yeah. If you're tired, take a rest!

[msg MARGARET_1PERSON_HP10_3]
Would you consider restoring your[n]health first?

[msg NANAKO_1PERSON_HP10_3]
Are you hurting?

[msg MARGARET_1PERSON_TP10_1]
Is there anything you can do to[n]recover?

[msg NANAKO_1PERSON_TP10_1]
You look like you're gonna faint...

[msg MARGARET_1PERSON_TP10_2]
I agree. It wouldn't do to be[n]reckless.

[msg NANAKO_1PERSON_TP10_2]
You shouldn't keep going when you're[n]so tired...

[msg MARGARET_1PERSON_TP10_3]
Hm, you are wholly out of stamina.

[msg NANAKO_1PERSON_TP10_3]
Let's all take a group rest since[n]we're tired!

[msg MARGARET_ITEM_90_BATTLE_]
Consider cleaning up your superfluous[n]collection of items.

[msg NANAKO_ITEM_90_BATTLE_1]
Your bag's getting full!

[msg MARGARET_ITEM_90_BATTLE__2]
You're holding a surplus of items.

[msg NANAKO_ITEM_90_BATTLE_2]
I'm good at sorting things!

[msg MARGARET_ITEM_90_BATTLE__3]
Are you aware that you may leave some[n]items with Theodore?

[msg NANAKO_ITEM_90_BATTLE_3]
Oh no, your bag is so full!

[msg MARGARET_1PERSON_HP80_1]
You seem to be doing well.

[msg NANAKO_1PERSON_HP80_1]
I'm doing well, too!

[msg MARGARET_1PERSON_HP80_2]
There is still someone who appears to[n]be in fine condition.

[msg NANAKO_1PERSON_HP80_2]
We can still keep going!

[msg MARGARET_1PERSON_HP80_3]
You should move on while you still[n]can.

[msg NANAKO_1PERSON_HP80_3]
You're doing great!

I shall support you from "behind the[n]camera," as they'd say here.

[msg NANAKO_DUNGEON_START_1]
Leave the navigation to me!

[msg MARGARET_DUNGEON_START_2]
Have you finished your preparations?[n]Then let's be off.

[msg NANAKO_DUNGEON_START_2]
Let's all be good teammates!

[msg MARGARET_DUNGEON_START_3]
Are you prepared?

[msg NANAKO_DUNGEON_START_3]
I'm all ready over here!

[msg MARGARET_QUEST_START_1]
Both of us will provide you support,[n]come what may.

[msg NANAKO_QUEST_START_1]
The special screening is starting!

[msg MARGARET_QUEST_START_2]
If everyone is ready, let us begin.

[msg NANAKO_QUEST_START_2]
Are you ready?

[msg MARGARET_QUEST_START_3]
Let's begin the special screening.

[msg NANAKO_QUEST_START_3]
I'll help, too! We can do it!

[msg MARGARET_TOUHA_25_1]
You're getting quite adept at this.

[msg NANAKO_TOUHA_25_1]
There's still a lot to explore. But[n]you can do it!

[msg MARGARET_TOUHA_25_2]
In truth, you've only just begun.

[msg NANAKO_TOUHA_25_2]
The map's a little bit done!

[msg MARGARET_TOUHA_50_1]
It looks like you're about halfway.

[msg NANAKO_TOUHA_50_1]
The map is half done!

[msg MARGARET_TOUHA_50_2]
You're exploring at a good pace.

[msg NANAKO_TOUHA_50_2]
Hehe, halfway there!

[msg MARGARET_TOUHA_75_1]
There's not much left of this floor.

[msg NANAKO_TOUHA_75_1]
Almost there. You can do it!

[msg NANAKO_TOUHA_75_2]
The map is almost finished!

[msg MARGARET_TOUHA_100_1]
You probably know this floor like the[n]back of your hand by now.

[msg NANAKO_TOUHA_100_1]
Yaaay! It's all done!

[msg MARGARET_TOUHA_100_2]
Well done. You've mastered this[n]floor.

[msg NANAKO_TOUHA_100_2]
Hehe, yaaaay. You finished the map!

[msg MARGARET_MAPPING_ICON_AL]
It looks like your map is exceedingly[n]accurate.

[msg NANAKO_MAPPING_ICON_ALL_]
That's an A+!

[msg MARGARET_MAPPING_ICON_AL_2]
You're exercising sound judgment.

[msg NANAKO_MAPPING_ICON_ALL__2]
Wow. This map is the best drawing[n]I've ever seen!

[msg MARGARET_MAPPING_ICON_KA]
With that level of skill, you ought[n]to have no fear of getting lost.

[msg NANAKO_MAPPING_ICON_KAID]
I feel like we'll never be lost!

[msg MARGARET_MAPPING_ICON_KA_2]
Let us mark these stairs down.

[msg NANAKO_MAPPING_ICON_KAID_2]
Hehe, now we have nothing to fear!

[msg MARGARET_MAPPING_CHANGE_]
I approve of your artistic[n]sensibility.

[msg NANAKO_MAPPING_CHANGE_CO]
What kinda map is this turning into?

[msg MARGARET_MAPPING_CHANGE__2]
I look forward to seeing the map when[n]it's done.

[msg NANAKO_MAPPING_CHANGE_CO_2]
Wow, you're good at drawing pictures!

[msg MARGARET_MAPPING_ICON_DE]
Doing some clean-up?

[msg NANAKO_MAPPING_ICON_DEL_]
I'm good at clean-up too!

[msg MARGARET_MAPPING_ICON_DE_2]
Of course, it's wise to correct[n]mistakes wherever possible.

[msg NANAKO_MAPPING_ICON_DEL__2]
Did you throw something away? You're[n]drawing something again?

[msg MARGARET_MAPPING_MEMO_1]
You mustn't forget important details.

[msg NANAKO_MAPPING_MEMO_1]
I'm a good writer, too!

[msg MARGARET_MAPPING_MEMO_2]
Writing notes for later reference is[n]an excellent habit.

[msg NANAKO_MAPPING_MEMO_2]
I'm gonna write a note, too. That[n]way, I won't forget.

Remain alert. A powerful enemy is[n]approaching.

A Reaper is coming!

The Reaper is close. Stay vigilant.

No! The Reaper is coming fast!
