A-ANOTHER ONE!? C'mon, partner! We've[n]gotta run for it!

[msg MSG_001 [Morgana]]
Tch, again? If we have to go through[n]this every time a carnivore shows up,[n]it's really gonna slow us down.

[msg MSG_002 [Akechi]]
Well, this time, perhaps we should make[n]use of that...

[msg MSG_003 [Chie]]
Oh, it's that gate―the electric one!
...Ah, I gotcha! Wait―we have to trap[n]that huge carnivore by ourselves!? But,[n]how?

[msg MSG_004 [Naoto]]
Unfortunately, that wouldn't do us any[n]good at the moment anyway, unless we[n]were to open up the gate as well.

[msg MSG_005 [Chie]]
Maaan, we're just stuck here!? What was[n]the point of suggesting the gate, then?

[msg MSG_006 [Naoto]]
Well, if we can find a way to manipulate[n]the gate, it should work to our[n]advantage.
That's why we have to find the switch[n]for it... then we can search for the[n]proper path to follow.
