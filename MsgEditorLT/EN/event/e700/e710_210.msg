Hm? What's that?

[msg MSG_001 [Ann]]
Oh, it looks like something's shining...

[msg MSG_002 [Yusuke]]
That's a rather beautiful glimmer... I[n]wish to observe it closer.

[msg MSG_003 [Ann]]
Wait, is it safe? It could be a trap!

[msg MSG_004 [Yusuke]]
Hmm, the more I look at it, the more[n]mysterious its shine becomes. Could such[n]an aura... be replicated with paint?

[msg MSG_005 [Ryuji]]
He ain't listenin' at all!

[msg MSG_006 [Futaba]]
Fox is useless once he gets like this.[n]Just ignore what he says.
But―more importantly! It looks like[n]there's something unusual there. Check[n]it out, Joker!

[msg MSG_007 [Yusuke]]
*sigh* I should've brought my art[n]supplies...
Grr... How careless could I be!?

[msg MSG_008 [Ryuji]]
Okay, bud, that's enough―let's go!
