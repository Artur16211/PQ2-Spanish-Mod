There you are, Inmate!

[msg MSG_001]
......?
Marie is, as usual, nowhere to be[n]seen...

[msg MSG_002 [Justine]]
Are you looking for Marie?
She seems to have gone out on another[n]errand for Margaret.

[msg MSG_003]
......?
There's another piece of stationery on[n]the floor...
Something has been written on it with[n]very serious-looking handwriting...

[msg MSG_004 [Marie]]
"Law"

[msg MSG_005 [Marie]]
Endorphin: a brain compound[n]Sulforaphane: an antioxidant Inosine:[n]allows muscle movement
So, do you see it? The one law of the[n]universe?
Everything comes down to chemicals...[n]And their reactions...

[msg MSG_006]
......
Is this another one of Marie's poems?

[msg MSG_007 [Marie]]
Gyaaaaaaaaah!

[msg MSG_008 [Marie]]
と-とろ'れ ょよろ ゐめぺろ をよゎ ろめもょや! びめもれ もれテテテ ゃゎれろ[n]ょよろまれ! づよる れろゎぽをもょむ! へよゎ れろゎぽを らめをれもぼれ ぺょぽ[n]ぼめまゆもれろるを ぺょぽ れろゎみみ もょ れぼめよよゅデ るもむめろ!?
I didn't write sulforaphane because it's[n]similar to Sandalphon or anything! They[n]sound nothing alike!
......
Ihateyoustupiddopeamine! I'm casting a[n]curse on you and now you'll always get[n]crappy grades in science!

[msg MSG_009]
Marie is blushing harder than ever[n]before...

[msg MSG_010 [Caroline]]
Now that you mention it, there seem to[n]be a number of skills that rely upon[n]such scientific reactions.

[msg MSG_011 [Justine]]
I see. This seems to merit further[n]experimentation.

[msg MSG_012 [Marie]]
No one needs your pointless experiments![n]I hope you all eat an Atomic Flare!

[msg MSG_013 [Margaret]]
*chuckle* Perhaps you should settle[n]down. This is one of your less[n]embarrassing works, anyway.

[msg MSG_014 [Marie]]
LESS embarrassing... *sigh* I put this[n]in my pocket. How did it end up falling[n]there?

[msg MSG_015 [Marie]]
*gasp* Could it be―Is this the law of[n]the universe?
Falling...
"Fall in love"... "Fallen angel"...

[msg MSG_016]
Marie returned to her usual spot,[n]noticeably unsettled...
