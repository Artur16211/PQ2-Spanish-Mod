Aww, a dead end. Oh well, I guess we[n]turn back...

Huh? 'Sup?

[msg MSG_004 [Ryuji]]
Huh? Oh... Thanks. I was on the track[n]team, y'know.

[msg MSG_004_1 [Ryuji]]
I still keep up with my training,[n]though.

[msg MSG_005 [Akihiko]]
Your upper body is very fit for someone[n]on the track team. Good job.

[msg MSG_006 [Chie]]
Hrgh, muscles, huh...? I want to train[n]mine too, but I don't want to end up all[n]bulgy...

[msg MSG_007 [Akihiko]]
Don't worry, Chie.
No amount of ordinary training would get[n]your muscles to bulge like that.

[msg MSG_007_1 [Akihiko]]
That kind of body is only obtained by[n]those skilled and determined enough to[n]put in countless hours of work.

[msg MSG_008 [Chie]]
Ooh, really!? Then, maybe I should work[n]on my muscles more often...

[msg MSG_009 [Ryuji]]
I wanna work on my hamstrings. There's a[n]ton of different workouts I've been[n]meanin' to try...

[msg MSG_010 [Ann]]
They've really bonded over the muscle[n]thing.

[msg MSG_011 [P3 Hero]]
Yeah. I'm sure Akihiko-senpai's training[n]routines will be helpful.
The only downside is: once he starts[n]talking about them, he doesn't stop...

[msg MSG_012 [Yosuke]]
Well, at least Chie and Ryuji look like[n]they're both having fun.
I'm glad they got to meet some people[n]they get along with... Same goes for all[n]of us, really.

Mhm! Let's keep it up, and continue to[n]do our very best!

[msg MSG_015 [Morgana]]
All right then, we should get going.[n]Make sure everyone stays on guard.
