Oh! This hole is so deep... I can't even[n]see the bottom.

[msg MSG_001 [Yukari]]
This would be awfully dangerous to fall[n]into―Whoa... Just looking into it is[n]making me sorta dizzy...

[msg MSG_002 [Junpei]]
Ooh, are you trying to say, "I hope[n]nobody comes along and accidentally[n]pushes me from behind"? Wink wink?

[msg MSG_003 [Yukari]]
Wha―!? No! You better not even try!

[msg MSG_004 [Naoto]]
Um, more importantly... Please take a[n]look at this.

[msg MSG_005 [Yukari]]
Oh, sorry for Stupei causing such a[n]scene. What did you find?

[msg MSG_006 [Naoto]]
Oh, it's fine... So, this tree stump's[n]nose seems like it functions as a switch[n]after all.

[sel SEL_007 top]
That round nose?
That long nose?
That Teddie?

[msg MSG_008 [P4 Hero]]

Nose?

[msg MSG_011 [Teddie]]
Aaaand... Teddie?

[msg MSG_012 [Teddie]]
That's me! What can I do for you?

[msg MSG_013 [Ryuji]]
We're done with that joke already,[n]dammit!
And you've got nothin' to do with this,[n]Teddie! Get outta here!

[msg MSG_014 [Teddie]]
Oh nooo! Skull's being a grumpy-pants...[n]You should increase your calcium intake[n]to lower the grumpiness of your pants.

[msg MSG_015 [Ryuji]]
Argh! That ain't it!

[msg MSG_016 [Teddie]]
Well, I'm feeling a bit tired. Ahhh,[n]this would make a comfy seat...

[msg MSG_017 [Naoto]]
Oh―hey, Teddie!? Don't go near that[n]stump!
We haven't figured out what it―

[msg MSG_018 [Naoto]]
...Wait, what's that sound!?
