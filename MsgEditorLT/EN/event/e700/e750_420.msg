Look! There's an FOE!

[msg MSG_000_1 [Ann]]
I, uh... don't want it coming anywhere[n]near us. Can we get out of here?

[msg MSG_001 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_002 [Aigis]]
It is not a problem, Panther.
Koromaru-san says, "[f 0 1 2]It is too big to fit[n]through this passage. There's no need to[n]worry[f 0 1 0]."

[msg MSG_003 [Ann]]
Ah, what a relief! I was gonna really[n]freak out for a second there...

[msg MSG_004 [Morgana]]
Don't worry, Panther. If anything comes[n]after you, I'll protect you!

[msg MSG_005 [Ann]]
Oh, no worries. Thanks, though.

[msg MSG_006 [Yosuke]]
Whoa, she blew you off so[n]effortlessly... That was actually kinda[n]impressive.

[msg MSG_007 [Naoto]]
Ah, I do have one concern about that[n]FOE...
Moving forward may not be an issue here,[n]but won't we have to dodge it[n]eventually?

[msg MSG_008 [Koromaru]]
Arf arf!

[msg MSG_009 [Aigis]]
Koromaru-san says, "[f 0 1 2]Use the lay of the[n]land to our advantage[f 0 1 0]."

[msg MSG_010 [Naoto]]
Since Joker's handling the map, we'll[n]leave the FOE-dodging strategy to him.

[msg MSG_010_5 [Naoto]]
Are you ready to keep going?
