Hold on, guys! I'm getting multiple[n]strong readings from beyond that door!

[msg MSG_001 [Chie]]
Huh!? Uhhh, just how strong are they?[n]What should we do!?

[msg MSG_002 [Futaba]]
...I've sensed this kind of reading[n]before.
It's similar to when we ran across, or[n][f 6 1 12 0 0 0]'s team...

[msg MSG_003 [Kanji]]
So, does that mean [f 6 1 27 0 0 0]-san's[n]companions are over there?

[msg MSG_004 [Rise]]
That might not be allâ€•I'm getting other[n]readings, too...

[msg MSG_005 [Morgana]]
Well, that's concerning...
Joker, what's your call? Regrouping[n]before we head in there is always an[n]option.

[msg MSG_006 [Morgana]]
There's no knowing what's up ahead...[n]Are we ready?

[sel SEL_007 top]
Let's go.
Let's regroup.

[msg MSG_008 [Morgana]]
Well then, time to brace ourselves and[n]get in there!

[msg MSG_009 [Morgana]]
Ah, that's a wise choice.
