Ah, just as I thought... We can reach[n]the tree trunks from this side.
It may be best to chop these into[n]smaller pieces and get them out of our[n]way.

[msg MSG_001 [Naoto]]
We would need some kind of axe for that.[n]Thankfully, we don't absolutely need to[n]open this path up―

[msg MSG_001_05 [Haru]]
Oh―! If you need an axe, why not just[n]leave it to me?

[msg MSG_002 [Haru]]
How about it, Joker? I think I can get[n]those trees out of the way!

[sel SEL_003 top]
Go for it, Noir.
Let's leave them be.

[msg MSG_004 [Haru]]
Yeah, leave it to me! It's just a[n]scaled-up version of chopping[n]firewood...

[msg MSG_005 [Haru]]
Here goes!

[msg MSG_005_02 [Morgana]]
Wh-Whoa... Holy cow, Noir! How... How[n]are you twirling while doing that!?

[msg MSG_005_04 [Teddie]]
Wooooow! She's totally splendiferous!

[msg MSG_006 [Haru]]
...And there we go! How was that?

[msg MSG_007 [Naoto]]
Thank you for your hard work. That'll[n]make exploring this area much easier.

[msg MSG_008 [Haru]]
No thanks necessary―all I did was chop[n]away!
After all, everyone else helped out with[n]hauling away the pieces...

[msg MSG_009 [Kanji]]
Aw, it was nothin'!

[msg MSG_009_02 [Teddie]]
Yeah! We just couldn't let you bear that[n]burden yourself. Leave the heavy lifting[n]to us strong men!

[msg MSG_009_04 [Yosuke]]
All YOU did was watch! Sheesh...

[msg MSG_010 [Haru]]
*giggle* Thank you for your help,[n]everyone. Well then, let's go!

[msg MSG_011 [Naoto]]
Very well. We'll leave this as is for[n]now.
