Looks like we've reached a new area...[n]And a seriously massive one at that!
There are robots everywhere, too. I[n]wonder how they maintain this...

[msg MSG_001 [Junpei]]
Well, they're machines that follow[n]orders, so wouldn't it be easy to keep[n]all of this clean?

[msg MSG_002 [Yukari]]
I know that! I'm talking about the[n]general attitude here that's bugging[n]me...

[msg MSG_003 [Akechi]]
Are you asking who decided what the[n]"normal" is supposed to be in this[n]world, Takeba-san?

[msg MSG_004 [Yukari]]
Yeah, that! I wanna know who actually[n]programmed this sort of lifestyle into[n]the machines.

[msg MSG_005 [Ken]]
Hmm, maybe the humans that made the[n]robots?

[msg MSG_006 [Naoto]]
In sci-fi movies, some kind of mother[n]computer is the typical controller of a[n]robotic society...

[msg MSG_007 [Ann]]
Ooh, I think I've heard of those! They[n]usually appear as the final obstacle for[n]the hero to overcome.
If I remember right, they're connected[n]to all the robots and their functions...[n]Or, something wild like that.

[msg MSG_008 [Yosuke]]
So you're saying they're some kind of[n]electronic leader... Doesn't that[n]describe the Overseer, then?

[msg MSG_009 [Chie]]
In that case, wouldn't we fix the movie[n]if we beat him up?
A leader that forces the entire world to[n]be the same is definitely wrong! I'm[n]totally gonna pummel him!

[msg MSG_010 [Morgana]]
Sounds like a plan to me. Now that[n]that's decided, let's go look for the[n]Overseer.

[msg MSG_011]
I notice Crow standing around while[n]everyone else continues on...

[msg MSG_012 [Akechi]]
A world that sacrifices the individual[n]for the many, hm? An authoritative[n]approach, for sure.

[msg MSG_013 [Akechi]]
...Joker, you've been staring at me― is[n]there something you want to say?
No one can overhear us back here, so if[n]there's something on your mind, let's[n]have it.

[sel SEL_014 top]
You're acting quite unusually.
That's my line. What's up?

[msg MSG_015 [Akechi]]
Huh? You think so? I didn't notice at[n]all...
I may be growing a bit anxious in this[n]environment without having realized it.

[msg MSG_016 [Akechi]]
Huh? Oh, nothing in particular...
I may be growing a bit anxious in this[n]environment without having realized it.

[msg MSG_017 [Akechi]]

And, while we're here, even I could―
No, never mind. I'll make sure to steel[n]myself from here on out.

[sel SEL_018 top]
Just keep up the usual.
You do that.

[msg MSG_019 [Akechi]]
...I guess I should say thanks. I'll[n]take advantage of your kind words for[n]now.

[msg MSG_020 [Akechi]]
Keep up the usual, huh...

[msg MSG_021 [Akechi]]
Mm, sorry. Thanks for warning me.

[msg MSG_022 [Yukari]]
Hey, you two! If you don't pick it up,[n]you're gonna be left behind!

[msg MSG_023 [Akechi]]
Well, you heard her. We should go,[n]Joker.
