Alright guys, you're safe! The reading[n]of that FOE is gone now.

[msg MSG_001 [Junpei]]
*gasp* *pant* What the hell happened[n]back there!? That totally freaked me[n]out!

[msg MSG_002 [Naoto]]
That was rather odd...
The large robot pursued us[f 0 1 0], but the[n][f 0 1 2]small one didn't even budge[f 0 1 0]...

[msg MSG_003 [Akechi]]
...The [f 0 1 2]small one may be performing[n]surveillance[f 0 1 0]. Maybe it sends out orders[n]when it sights an enemy?

[msg MSG_004 [Ann]]
Wait a sec―you're saying those FOEs are[n]partnered up!?

[msg MSG_005 [Mitsuru]]
Well, it does seem to make sense.
If we're discovered by the small FOE,[n]the large FOE will pursue us[f 0 1 0].
This is rather troublesome...

[msg MSG_006 [Yukiko]]
But, think of it the other way―we should[n]be fine as long as we prevent being[n]spotted.

[msg MSG_007 [Kanji]]
Yeah! Although, wouldn't it be even[n]easier if we just [f 0 1 2]beat up[f 0 1 0] the small one?

[msg MSG_008 [Rise]]
You have a point―I'm not getting a very[n]strong reading from the small one,[n]but...

[msg MSG_009 [Mitsuru]]
Let's leave that decision to Joker.
However, I will say that it'd be wise to[n]avoid any unnecessary fighting―even more[n]so if we're up against FOEs.
