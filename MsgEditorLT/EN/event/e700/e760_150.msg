...A dead end, hm? Well, we may as well[n]take a break here; I'm hungry.

[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
Oh man, I would kill for some ramen[n]right now. I want a seasoned egg,[n]roasted pork, and extra green onions...

[msg MSG_002 [Chie]]
Hrgh... Just thinking about that[n]suddenly made me hungry...

[msg MSG_003 [Junpei]]
Ramen's a real guilty pleasure. One of[n]those devilish foods you suddenly crave[n]out of the blue...
Imagine the noodles mingling with the[n]lightly toasted garlic oil and picking[n]up the soup as you slurp it all up...!

[msg MSG_004 [Yusuke]]
Now I'm even hungrier. You'd better take[n]responsibility for this.

[msg MSG_005 [Junpei]]
Fiiiine. I'll treat you to a bowl when[n]we get outta here.

[msg MSG_006 [Yusuke]]
Your treat...!? I'll show up even if it[n]means I have to crawl my way there, so[n]wait for me!

[msg MSG_007 [Yosuke]]
Sheesh, he's desperate...
Still, getting ramen with everyone does[n]sound great. I'll be joining you guys[n]when the time comes, all right?

[msg MSG_008 [Ryuji]]
Welp, now that we've all got somethin'[n]to look forward to, let's get back to[n]it!
