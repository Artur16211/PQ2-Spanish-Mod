*sigh* That was quite the meandering[n]detour, but looks like we're finally[n]back on our original path.

[msg MSG_001 [Akechi]]
I've been wondering... Could we do[n]something about those trees from this[n]side of them?
Simplifying our escape route just in[n]case something went awry could make a[n]big difference for us down the line.

[msg MSG_002 [Ryuji]]
Oh, yeah, a huge difference―but how[n]would we even do somethin' like that?

[msg MSG_003 [Akechi]]
Well, if my theory is correct...
Hey, Joker―what if we were to go there[n]and inspect the area from this side? Of[n]course, I leave the decision to you...
