Looks like that Kamoshida Square is on[n]the other side of these gates.
I'm getting readings of Queen and[n]Noir... and Kamoshidaman, too.
Be careful, everyone!

[msg MSG_001 [Morgana]]
Yeah, I doubt he'd just pleasantly hand[n]those two over to us...
He'll most likely be a tough opponent,[n]so we could potentially benefit from[n]heading back and regrouping first.
We'll leave that decision to you, Joker―[n]what should we do?

Beyond these gates is Kamoshida Square.
I'm getting readings of Queen and[n]Noir... and Kamoshidaman, too.
Are you really ready to do this?

[sel SEL_003 top]
Let's go.
Not yet.

[msg MSG_004 [Morgana]]
Okay, then―everyone, follow Joker's[n]lead!

[msg MSG_005 [Morgana]]
We can't be too cautious, after all.[n]Let's make sure we charge in fully[n]prepared.
