Whoa!? I-Is that an FOE!? Look how[n]effin' huge it is...

[msg MSG_001 [Koromaru]]
Bark! Grrrr...

[msg MSG_002 [Aigis]]
Koromaru-san is extremely on edge about[n]it as well. It seems to be quite the[n]dangerous foe.

[msg MSG_003 [Yusuke]]
If that monstrosity were to go on a[n]rampage, I imagine it could easily[n]destroy the theaters around it...

[msg MSG_004 [Yosuke]]
I mean, it's already destroyed a bunch[n]of stuff here. That thing is way too[n]strong!

[msg MSG_005 [Koromaru]]
Bark! Bark!

[msg MSG_006 [Aigis]]
"The FOE is coming this way. Be[n]careful," is what he is telling us!

[msg MSG_007 [Ryuji]]
For real!? Hey, we gotta get outta here,[n]Joker!
