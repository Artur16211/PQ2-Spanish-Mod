Joker, look here. This part of the floor[n]seems to have some special function...
Do you think... we're supposed to step[n]on it?

[sel SEL_001 top]
Let's hop on and find out.
I don't know about that.

[msg MSG_002 [Akihiko]]
Yeah, let's do it!

[msg MSG_003 [Mitsuru]]
Stop, Akihiko.
Don't meddle with things that we don't[n]understand.

[msg MSG_004 [Mitsuru]]
That seems wise. There's no need to[n]meddle with something that has unknown[n]effects.

[msg MSG_005 [Yukiko]]
Hmm... But I'm still awfully curious.[n]Maybe this has something to do with that[n]device we saw earlier.

[msg MSG_005_5 [Yukiko]]
Hey, Chieâ€•why don't we try jumping on[n]this?

[msg MSG_006 [Chie]]
Huh!? Uhhhh... Doesn't that seem like a[n]bad idea?

[msg MSG_007 [Kanji]]
And weren't we just told not to do[n]that!?

[msg MSG_008 [Yukiko]]
Yeah, but... doesn't that just make you[n]want to do it even more? Or is it only[n]me?

[msg MSG_009 [Akechi]]
Ah, well, uh... If we find no other[n]path, then I suppose we could give it a[n]try.

[msg MSG_010 [Mitsuru]]
That's a good point. Joker, we'll leave[n]the testing up to you.
