...Is that a ladder? I wonder where it[n]leads.

[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
It's pretty high up there...

[msg MSG_002 [Ann]]
Maybe you can reach it, Skullâ€•you've[n]trained your legs in the Track Team...
You should be able to, like, do the high[n]jump and reach it.

[msg MSG_003 [Ryuji]]
No way am I reaching that! Plus... I[n]specialized in sprints.

[msg MSG_003_05 [Yusuke]]
Is that so?
I was looking forward to seeing your[n]graceful leaping...

[sel SEL_004 top]
It's impossible.
Try jumping for us, Skull.

[msg MSG_005 [Ryuji]]
Right? No way anyone's reachin' it like[n]that...

[msg MSG_006 [Ryuji]]
Hey, cut out the impossible demands![n]What am I, some insane bird man!?

[msg MSG_008 [Akechi]]
Perhaps that makes for an access point[n]to somewhere...

[msg MSG_008_5 [Akechi]]
But at this point, there's no use[n]speculating about it. Let's keep moving[n]for now.
