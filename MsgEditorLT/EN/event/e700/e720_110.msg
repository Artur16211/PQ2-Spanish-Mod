Ah, I see... The [f 0 1 2]cage rotates when you[n]turn the switch[f 0 1 0].

[msg MSG_001 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Yes! Now we can keep going!

[msg MSG_002 [Yusuke]]
Even though the humans here are long[n]gone, the facility is still up and[n]running. Quite fortunate for us.

[msg MSG_003 [Futaba]]
Hup! I'm getting multiple strong[n]readings up ahead. They seem to be FOEs.[n]Be caref―
Hm? Wait―I'm getting other readings,[n]too...

[msg MSG_004 [Ann]]
Huh? What could those be?

[msg MSG_005 [Futaba]]
Hmmm... Not Shadows, that I know.[n]Different from FOEs and dinosaurs,[n]too...
I don't get it, what is―? I can't get a[n]solid lock on them!
I'm sensing a group of strong readings,[n]but nothing more useful than that.[n]Sorry!

[msg MSG_006 [Makoto]]
What could this mean?

[msg MSG_007 [P3 Fem Protag]]
A group of strong readings―could that[n]be...? Probably not, but...

[msg MSG_008 [Morgana]]
Hmm, looks like we have no idea what'll[n]happen from here on.
Be careful as we progress onward, Joker.
