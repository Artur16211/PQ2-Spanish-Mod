It's a dead end. Looks like a good time[n]for a break!

[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
Awright...
Y'know, I've been thinkin' about this[n]for a while now, but isn't it insane[n]that we're gettin' comms from Risette?

[sel SEL_002 top]
It is insane.
You think?
I'm used to it already.

[msg MSG_003 [Ryuji]]
Right? I'm so glad I'm a Persona-user...

[msg MSG_004 [Ryuji]]
Whaddya mean, "You think!?" This is[n]super idol Risette we're talkin' about!

[msg MSG_005 [Ryuji]]
As if! We're talkin' about super idol[n]Risette!

[msg MSG_006 [Kanji]]
Don't you think yer goin' a little[n]overboard here? It's nothin' out of the[n]ordinary.

[msg MSG_007 [Ryuji]]
There's nothin' ordinary about it! How[n]the hell can you feel that way?

[msg MSG_008 [Futaba]]
I can understand how you feel, Skull,[n]but your fanboying's starting to get[n]creepy.

[msg MSG_009 [Ryuji]]
Shuddup! At least lemme enjoy this!

[msg MSG_010 [Morgana]]
Hey, Skull! We already have the[n]supermodel Panther on our team! You[n]haven't forgotten about her, have you?

[msg MSG_011 [Ryuji]]
Uh, it's not like I forgot or anythin'.[n]I've just known her since middle school,[n]so that's nothin' new...

[msg MSG_012 [Yosuke]]
Ohh, I get you. It's important to keep[n]it fresh!

[msg MSG_013 [Ann]]
...Hey, Skull. I think you and I need to[n]have a little talk.

[msg MSG_014 [Rise]]
Same goes for you, Yosuke-senpai.

[msg MSG_015 [Ryuji]]
Huh!? Oh, uh, I was just kiddin'...!

[msg MSG_016 [Yosuke]]
Y-Yeah, we didn't mean it like that...[n]Hahaha...

[msg MSG_017 [Morgana]]
Good grief... These two really are[n]hopeless.
