We made it! Well then, let's begin the[n]hunt!

[msg MSG_001 [Chie]]
Whoa, look at this meat! It's... the[n]meat to end all meats!!!

[msg MSG_002 [Yosuke]]
Chie, are you actually drooling?

[msg MSG_003 [Chie]]
Eheheh... I can't help it when something[n]this delicious-looking is right in front[n]of me.

[msg MSG_004 [Kanji]]
Well, if Chie-senpai's a fan of it, I[n]bet it'll attract that carnivore real[n]easy.

[msg MSG_005 [Makoto]]
Let's try placing it a safe distance[n]away from that dinosaur and see if that[n]lures it from the path.

[msg MSG_006 [Ann]]
But, this meat's still frozen―is that[n]okay?

[msg MSG_007 [Naoto]]
I remember hearing that carnivores have[n]well-developed senses of smell for[n]sniffing out their prey...

Let's defrost it.
Let's cook it.
Let's add some Teddie to it.

[msg MSG_010 [Akechi]]
If it reacts to smells, then why don't[n]we cook the meat?

[msg MSG_011 [Yukiko]]
Cook―That's it!

[msg MSG_012 [Teddie]]
Noooo! Is there no mercy for a bear in[n]this world!?

[msg MSG_013 [Akechi]]
If it reacts to smells, then why don't[n]we cook the meat?

[msg MSG_014 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Yeah! I'm sure the dinosaur will come[n]skipping towards the delicious, meaty[n]scent!

[msg MSG_015 [Makoto]]
There were cooking utensils in the[n]freezer container, so we ought to make[n]use of those.

[msg MSG_016 [Ryuji]]
By the way―where are we gonna cook? I[n]haven't seen a kitchen in this jungle.

[msg MSG_017 [Ann]]
Um... Back at the movie theater?

[msg MSG_018 [Yosuke]]
No! If we let them cook in an enclosed[n]space, we'll all end up dead!

[msg MSG_019 [Chie]]
Hey! What's that supposed to mean,[n]Yosuke!?

[msg MSG_020 [Yosuke]]
*gasp* I mean, well, you know...[n]U-Uhhhh...

[sel SEL_021 top]
Grilling indoors is dangerous.
The theater lacks a kitchen, too.

[msg MSG_022 [P4 Hero]]
Joker does make a good point...
Considering how large this cut of meat[n]is, it'd be difficult to cook with[n]ordinary-sized flames.

[msg MSG_023 [Yosuke]]
Yeah, that! It's too dangerous for[n]indoor cooking! Grilling outside will be[n]a lot easier, and safer...
It'll be easier to run away, too...!

[msg MSG_024 [Akechi]]
That's true, Joker makes a good point.[n]There were no gas ranges or anything of[n]that nature in the movie theater...

[msg MSG_025 [Yosuke]]
Yeah, yeah! We can't even do it there[n]anyway, so wouldn't an outdoor setup be[n]better?
It'll be easier to run away, too...!

[msg MSG_026 [Yusuke]]
Still, cooking outdoors includes the[n]risk of starting a forest fire...

[msg MSG_027 [Makoto]]
In that case, we may want to do this[n]near a river, so we can douse the fire[n]immediately if it gets out of hand.
Let's look for a spot around here near a[n]water source where we can cook.
