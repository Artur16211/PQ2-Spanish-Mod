Hey, Rise-chan! Are we going the right[n]way?

[msg MSG_001 [Rise]]
Sure are! Just keep going straight.

[msg MSG_002 [Chie]]
Hm? Hey, what's that over there?

[msg MSG_003 [Kanji]]
Aw, seriously!? What the hell? There's a[n]bunch of damn trees blockin' our way!

[msg MSG_004 [Akechi]]
Joker, look here...
There are large claw marks at the bases[n]of these trees.

[sel SEL_005 top]
They look freshly made.
Dinosaur markings?

[msg MSG_006 [Akechi]]
Yeah, it seems they weren't kidding[n]about being through with us.

[msg MSG_007 [Teddie]]
Wait, are you saying that the herbivores[n]are blocking our path on purpose!?
But, why?

[msg MSG_008 [Akechi]]
Yeah, and they look relatively new... It[n]appears that they've intentionally[n]blocked our path.

[msg MSG_009 [Yukiko]]
Hmm... That must mean they really don't[n]want us to follow them, huh?

[msg MSG_010 [Kanji]]
Who cares!? We can't back off now, after[n]all this!

[msg MSG_011 [Naoto]]
Although, look at these huge trees,[n]mowed down so easily... These truly are[n]real dinosaurs we're after.

[msg MSG_012 [Ryuji]]
Y'know, that's a good pointâ€•we could be[n]in some deep shit if we piss 'em off...

[msg MSG_013 [Makoto]]
Just as a diamond on a dung heap is[n]still a diamond... as timid as they may[n]be, they're dinosaurs nonetheless.

[msg MSG_014 [Yosuke]]
This is gonna be a real hassle, but I[n]guess we've just gotta look for another[n]way around this.
