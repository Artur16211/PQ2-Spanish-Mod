Tch, this is a dead end too...

[msg MSG_001 [Naoto]]
I know we mustn't fret, but these do[n]test my patience.

My legs are super sore. I need a break.

[msg MSG_003 [Hikari]]
Well, we're definitely making progress.[n]You're all so amazing... How can you be[n]so strong?

[msg MSG_004 [Yosuke]]
Heheh, your cheering us on's helping out[n]a lot too, Hikari-chan.

[msg MSG_005 [Hikari]]
R-Really...? It makes me really happy to[n]hear that I'm actually being helpful.
You've all done so much for me, so now I[n]want to return the favor...
I hope my cheers reach the people who're[n]trapped in those theaters too.

[msg MSG_006 [Ryuji]]
...Yeah. Here's hopin'.
Welp, Hikari's doin' her best, so this[n]ain't the time for us to be sittin' on[n]our asses!
