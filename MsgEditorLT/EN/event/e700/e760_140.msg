Huh? Looks like this is a dead end. I[n]guess we'll have to find another way.

[msg MSG_001 [Ann]]
It's definitely a hassle, but what else[n]can we do?
*sigh* I could walk around forever if I[n]was window shopping.

[msg MSG_002 [Yukari]]
You know, that reminds me, Panther. You[n]work as a model, right?

[msg MSG_003 [Ann]]
Mhm, it's just a part-time gig, though.[n]I've always loved fashion.
There's some clothing stores in the[n]area, so I took a quick look inside them[n]when we first came here...
But all the clothes here are, well... a[n]little too out there for me.
Kamoshidaman was printed all over them[n]too. No way I'm wearing that.

[msg MSG_004 [Yukari]]
Ohh, Kamoshidaman's that guy with the[n]huge smile, right?
Yeah, that smile's too much... I don't[n]think I'd ever want to wear that either.

[sel SEL_005 top]
Yeah, it's lame.
I think it's stylish.
I want one.

[msg MSG_006 [Ann]]
Right? You think so too, Joker!?

[msg MSG_007 [Ann]]
Wait, seriously!?
Maybe it's popular here in this city,[n]but... Kamoshidaman clothes?
Hgh, nope! I just imagined it, but I[n]can't do it! There's no way I'd want[n]that face anywhere on my body!

[msg MSG_008 [Ann]]
What!? Are you serious?

[msg MSG_009 [Yukari]]
Well, everyone's got their own tastes...[n]but if someone ever got me to wear it,[n]it'd have to be for some kind of dare.

[msg MSG_010 [P3 Fem Protag]]
But isn't it possible for it to be so[n]lame that it's actually cool?

[msg MSG_011 [Ann]]
I don't think so. No amount of lameness[n]is ever gonna make something like that[n]okay.

[msg MSG_012 [Morgana]]
Don't worry, Panther!
I'm positive you'd look absolutely[n]gorgeous in Kamoshidaman clothes!

[msg MSG_013 [Ann]]
Uh, that's not what we're saying. I[n]don't care if I'd look good in them or[n]not.

[msg MSG_014 [Morgana]]
Mew!?

[msg MSG_015 [Yukari]]
Well, we'll have to leave shopping for[n]after we all make it back home safe.
Come on, let's keep going!
