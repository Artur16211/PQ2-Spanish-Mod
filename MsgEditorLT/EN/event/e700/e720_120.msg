What in the hell? There's somethin'[n]weird lyin' here...

Ahhhh, how magnificent! The hue, the[n]luster, the form... It's overflowing[n]with aesthetic sensibility!

Come on, Fox... Do we have to do this[n]again? It's got a hole in itâ€•it's trash!

[msg MSG_003 [Haru]]
Maybe, but it could also potentially be[n]of use to us.
Why don't we have Theodore take a look[n]at it when we get back to the movie[n]theater?

[msg MSG_007 [Ryuji]]
Alright, alright! Then... you hold onto[n]it, Joker.

[msg MSG_008]
We should go consult Theodore when we[n]return to the movie theater...
