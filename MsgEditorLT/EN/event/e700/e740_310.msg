Hey, look at that... That's one helluva[n]wicked axe it's luggin' around.

[msg MSG_001 [Yukiko]]
Mmhm, and what a scary face it has...[n]Could it be upset for some reason?
We have Hikari-chan with us, so it would[n]be best to try and avoid enemies who[n]would give us trouble in a fight.

[msg MSG_002 [Morgana]]
Then, what should we do now?

[sel SEL_003 top]
Let's lure it away with some bait.
Let's consult Noir.

[msg MSG_004 [Yukiko]]
Yeah―it worked once for us already, so I[n]think we should try it again.

[msg MSG_005 [P4 Hero]]
N-No! ...We should go with a more solid[n]plan this time.
Why don't we ask Noir for advice, as our[n]resident axe expert?

[msg MSG_006 [P4 Hero]]
Right. She wields an axe herself, so she[n]could be of help with this.

[msg MSG_007 [Haru]]
Well... axes have a rather short attack[n]range, so it's best not to get too[n]close.
Also, an axe that large seems awfully[n]heavy, so I doubt it can swing that[n]continually―only one whack at a time.

Its expression[f 0 1 0] may make for a useful[n]clue with its attack timing, too.
Doesn't it seem like it would be the[n]most dangerous when it's at its[n]angriest?

[msg MSG_010 [Yusuke]]
That would make sense. We'll leave our[n]dodge timing up to you, Joker.
