So you're back, Inmate.

[msg MSG_001]
......?
Marie is nowhere in sight...

[msg MSG_002 [Caroline]]
What, is she out again?

[msg MSG_003]
......?
There's another piece of stationery on[n]the floor...
Something's been written on it with[n]cutesy handwriting...

[msg MSG_004 [Marie]]
"Surprise Birthday"

[msg MSG_005 [Marie]]
It's the special day for the one I love
Let there be champagne and strawberry[n]cake
Oh, did you notice? My love is baked[n]into it
All for just a bit of excitement[n](P-A-S-S-I-O-N)
Seek the message hidden in the chocolate[n]in curlicued script:
'Isle of View': a clear sign
Maybe I'll lick the frosting off your[n]cheek (Mmm!)
Don't tell me I'm hogging the sweets!
I'm only a greedy pig for you, monsieur
I'm only crazy for you, monsieur

[msg MSG_006]
......
Is this another one of Marie's poems?

[msg MSG_007 [Marie]]
Hwaaaaaaaah!

[msg MSG_008 [Marie]]
Wait, wait! This is one of the worst[n]ones!
I just got worked up, is all! I just[n]want a bit of excitement, not this much!
......
GeezIhateyoustupidsurprisemonsieur!

[msg MSG_009]
Marie's face has gone beet red, all the[n]way to her ears...

[msg MSG_010 [Caroline]]
"Isle of View"? What sort of message is[n]hidden there?

[msg MSG_011 [Justine]]
Is that... some kind of island... where[n]you can see―

[msg MSG_012 [Marie]]
No! Isle of View is just another way to[n]read "I love you," obviousl―

[msg MSG_013 [Marie]]
...Ah!
I-I mean, there's no hidden message! Why[n]would there be some idiotic surprise[n]like that!?

[msg MSG_014]
She looks really desperate...

[msg MSG_015 [Marie]]
This can't be happening... I'm sure I[n]put this away...

[msg MSG_016]
Marie returned to her usual spot,[n]noticeably unsettled...
