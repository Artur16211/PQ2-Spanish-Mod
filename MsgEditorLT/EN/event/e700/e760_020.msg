Guess we can't go this way.
Man... There's drawings all over the[n]walls. What's that called again?

However, lately, some have recognized it[n]as an art. I've heard there's even been[n]exhibitions held for it.
Supposedly, when an artist finds artwork[n]they consider worse than their own,[n]they'll paint over it.

[msg MSG_002 [Morgana]]
So, this is art too? I don't really get[n]it...

[msg MSG_003 [Yusuke]]
Regardless of what one's art looks like,[n]painting over another's piece without[n]their permission seems disrespectful...
But perhaps that's how they pit their[n]skills against one another...

[msg MSG_004 [Akechi]]
Ah, yes, I suppose that's one way to[n]look at it. I'd imagine it's somewhat of[n]an unspoken rule among such artists.

[msg MSG_005 [Yusuke]]
That would certainly make others eager[n]to demonstrate their skills. Well then,[n]maybe I, too, should―

Don't do it.
Let's get going.

[msg MSG_007 [Futaba]]
He's right, Inari. We don't have time,[n]so rein it in.

[msg MSG_008 [Yusuke]]
Hrgh...

[msg MSG_009 [Yusuke]]
Very well, then... I suppose I'll have[n]to save it for another time.
