It seems to be a dead end. Why don't we[n]use this time to take a break?

[msg MSG_001 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Agreed!
I've been walking around and looking at[n]all of these movie posters for so long,[n]my neck's starting to hurt.

[msg MSG_002 [Haru]]
Me too. It's hard not to look at them[n]all when there's so many.

[msg MSG_003 [Hikari]]
What kind of movies do you all usually[n]watch? Have you seen anything recently?

[msg MSG_004 [Yosuke]]
My partner and I saw this movie called[n]the "Loan of the Ring" that was pretty[n]fun.
The plot was insane, though. It was[n]about these guys risking their lives in[n]order to pay for their engagement rings.

[msg MSG_005 [P4 Hero]]
But it was good. It even inspired me to[n]be more courageous.

[msg MSG_006 [Mitsuru]]
Let's see here... The romance movie I[n]saw recently was fairly interesting.

[msg MSG_007 [Shinjiro]]
...A romance movie? You?

[msg MSG_008 [Mitsuru]]
Whaâ€•!? What's wrong with that?
It's not that odd for me to watch[n]something romantic, is it?

[msg MSG_009 [Akihiko]]
It's not so much odd as is it hard to[n]imagine. You weren't interested in stuff[n]like that before.

[msg MSG_010 [Mitsuru]]
Really? They're surprisingly[n]entertaining.
People who are slaves to love often let[n]their emotions get the better of them[n]and make irrational decisions.
There's much I don't understand... But[n]watching people I'm nothing like is[n]quite fun.

[msg MSG_011 [Yosuke]]
That's one way to look at it...

[msg MSG_012 [Hikari]]
*giggle* I think the fact someone can[n]enjoy them in that way is one of the[n]things that makes them so great.
Movies allow you to experience things[n]that you sometimes can't and get a[n]glimpse of someone else's values.
Depending on how you watch it, there's[n]lots of different ways to enjoy a movie.

[msg MSG_013 [Akihiko]]
I see. It's true that it's important to[n]learn about values and worlds different[n]from our own.

[msg MSG_014 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Well then, would you like to watch one[n]with me, Akihiko-senpai? I know the[n]perfect romance movie!

[msg MSG_015 [Shinjiro]]
...Nah, that'd be impossible for Aki. I[n]bet he'd fall asleep.

[msg MSG_016 [Akihiko]]
What? That's not...
...Well, maybe you're right.

[msg MSG_017 [Mitsuru]]
I thought as much.
...Well then, let's wrap up our little[n]chat. We need to keep going.
