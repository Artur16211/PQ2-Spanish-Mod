Huh!? The door closed on us!

[msg MSG_001 [Mitsuru]]
Hm, it seems that this door [f 0 1 2]works in[n]conjunction with the others like it[f 0 1 0].
They always [f 0 1 2]open and close with the[n]similar doors elsewhere[f 0 1 0]... Progressing[n]through here is not going to be easy.

[msg MSG_002 [Morgana]]
Well, Joker, now's the time to make good[n]use of our map!
Be sure to note which doors are linked,[n]all right?

[msg MSG_003 [Yukiko]]
Oh! In that case, wouldn't it be better[n]if we had something for that?
Like, a new mark for the map!

[msg MSG_004 [Makoto]]
That's true. Fox?

[msg MSG_005 [Yusuke]]
I know just the thing... How about this?

[msg MSG_006 [Yukari]]
Eh!? Wow, he's insanely good! This would[n]be really useful for the map.

[msg MSG_007 [Mitsuru]]
You're our onsite commander, Joker. Make[n]sure that you draw an accurate map while[n]we traverse this movie.

[msg MSG_ICON_AB_GATE_OPEN]
A [f 0 1 2]Security Gate[f 0 1 0] icon has been added to[n]the map on the bottom screen.
If you wish to check how to use this[n]icon once more...
Press [f 0 1 2]HELP[f 0 1 0] at the bottom right of the[n]map and check the [f 0 1 2]Icon Types[f 0 1 0].
