Oh! Over there!

[msg MSG_001 [Ann]]
It's a, uh... was it "BLT"?

[msg MSG_002 [Akechi]]
FOE.

[msg MSG_003 [Yusuke]]
That's right. I believe it stands for[n]"Fried chicken On Egg"...

[msg MSG_004 [Ryuji]]
Uh, what? Beef's way better with eggs[n]than chicken.

[msg MSG_005 [Yusuke]]
No―I stand by chicken. It's both cheap[n]and filling.

While we ignore those comedians...

[msg MSG_007 [Ann]]
Wait, that's not good! We won't be able[n]to go any further...

[msg MSG_008 [Ryuji]]
Hey, I just noticed―ain't that guy just[n]walking around the same area?
Couldn't we, like, slip past him when[n]the coast is clear?

[msg MSG_009 [Futaba]]
Ah, that's it! Good job, Skull! You're[n]actually useful sometimes!

[msg MSG_010 [Ryuji]]
SOME times!?

[msg MSG_011 [Futaba]]
From the looks of it, this FOE's[n]patrolling a fixed route.
Even after checking more closely, I'm[n]still not getting an immediately hostile[n]reading from it...
It's possible that it won't act unless[n]ordered by the police.

[msg MSG_012 [Ann]]
So it won't attack us unless we make the[n]first move?

[msg MSG_013 [Akechi]]
Well then, why don't we observe the[n]FOE's movements for a moment?
If we work out its pattern, we'll surely[n]be able to evade it.

[msg MSG_014 [Ryuji]]
Alright! The Phantom Thieves are gettin'[n]sneaky!
Let's do this, Joker!

[msg MSG_015 [Yusuke]]
It'll be quite troublesome if it catches[n]up to us while we're fighting other[n]enemies.
Be sure to remain cautious while running[n]away from FOEs.
