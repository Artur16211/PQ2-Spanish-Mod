There you are, Inmate!

[msg MSG_001]
......?
Marie is, once again, nowhere to be[n]found...

[msg MSG_002 [Justine]]
Are you looking for Marie? Come to think[n]of it, I've not seen her in a while.

[msg MSG_003]
......?
There's another piece of stationery on[n]the floor...
Something's been written on it with[n]ostentatious handwriting...

[msg MSG_004 [Marie]]
"Bloody Bride"

[msg MSG_005 [Marie]]
Me, the perfect woman for you? Ha, don't[n]make me laugh. No one shall lift this[n]veil of mine!
Even if you win my mortal coil, I would[n]never sell my soul...
Don't get it wrong―this is a contract. I[n]am a cursed bride, toyed with by fate.
I shall leave an eternal -mark- on[n]you... THIS is my vow:
A guilty kiss...

[msg MSG_006]
......
Is this another one of Marie's poems?

[msg MSG_007 [Marie]]
Hyaaaaaaaaah!

[msg MSG_008 [Marie]]
W-W-W-Why did you read that!? No,[n]wait―how do you keep finding them!?
Stop toying with me, got it!? Or else,[n]I'm going to leave an eternal mark on[n]your face!
......
OohIhateyoucurseyouforeverandever! This[n]is all a stupid misunderstanding!

[msg MSG_009]
Marie's face has gone bright red, all[n]the way down to her neck...

[msg MSG_010 [Caroline]]
"Guilty kiss"?

[msg MSG_011 [Justine]]
It's a curse... In other words, it must[n]be a skill that erodes one's spiritual[n]power.

[msg MSG_012 [Marie]]
No no no! What are you even talking[n]about!? It's a melding of one's pain and[n]suffering and sadness all into a sinful―
...Ngh!

[msg MSG_013 [Marie]]
You're ALL guilty!

[msg MSG_014 [Marie]]
...I thought I put this away? What's it[n]even doing here!?

[msg MSG_015]
Marie returned to her usual spot,[n]noticeably unsettled...
