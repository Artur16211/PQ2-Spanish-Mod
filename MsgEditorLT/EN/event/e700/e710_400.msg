...Ah! What's this!?

[msg MSG_000_5 [Yusuke]]
It appears to be quite an old camera...[n]but, what a refined design it has!

[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
Hup, Fox's art alarm's gone off again...

[msg MSG_002 [Futaba]]
Come on! There's no time for playing[n]around, all right? We're about to go[n]save Queen and Noir.
It could very well lead to a battle, so[n]you'd better be careful.

[msg MSG_003 [Akechi]]
...Joker? What's wrong? You looked like[n]you were lost in thought there.
You seem awfully curious about this[n]camera...

[msg MSG_004]
I sense some kind of mysterious power[n]from the camera...
I get the feeling that we can return to[n]the movie theater with this...
Perhaps it's a good idea to return to[n]the theater and regroup...

[msg MSG_005]
You will be able to save and exit the[n]labyrinth here.
