Hold on, Joker!
...I understand how you feel, but[n]there's no chance of us winning against[n]him right now.
I know how much you're worried for those[n]two, but you need to calm down... for[n]their sakes.

It's frustrating as hell, but Crow's[n]right.
We gotta retreat for now so we can save[n]Queen and Noir soonâ€•okay, man!?
