Man, what a sight... There're robots[n]everywhere you look.

[msg MSG_001 [Junpei]]
Hey, that reminds me. Everyone here's[n]from a different time, right?
Then, does that mean there's a chance[n]that future Japan looks just like this?

[sel SEL_002 top]
Of course not.
Pretty much.

[msg MSG_003 [Junpei]]
Wait, seriously!?

[msg MSG_004 [Makoto]]
Of course not.

[msg MSG_005 [P4 Hero]]
Considering they know who Rise is,[n]wouldn't that mean that our times aren't[n]that far apart?

[msg MSG_006 [Junpei]]
Figures...

Well, if it's mystery you want, I think[n]Aigis's existence is pretty fascinating.

[msg MSG_008 [Junpei]]
Yeah, but I'm talking more about, you[n]know... a futuristic city sort of thing.
I want a full-fledged sci-fi world that[n]calls out to the little kid inside.

[msg MSG_009 [Ken]]
I get that!

[msg MSG_009_1 [Ken]]
Oh, um... I meant that I'm interested in[n]the latest technology, not the little[n]kid thing.
I'm talking about things like giant[n]mechs and mass-produced robots!

[msg MSG_010 [Naoto]]
Oh, I can understand that as well.[n]I'm... well... somewhat interested in[n]machinery...

[msg MSG_011 [Futaba]]
Ooh, everyone's interests may differ a[n]little, but it sounds like you're all[n]pretty passionate.

[msg MSG_011_1 [Futaba]]
I bet it'd be fun if all the sci-fi fan[n]Persona-users had a little get-together.

[msg MSG_012 [Makoto]]
I feel like that'd be a pretty intense.[n]I don't think I'd be able to keep up[n]with the conversation...
More importantly, this seems to be a[n]dead end. Let's try another path.
