Hey, we can't go that way. It looks like[n]we're gonna have to find some other[n]path.

[msg MSG_001 [Yukari]]
It's a pain in the butt, but there's not[n]much we can do about it. Why don't we[n]get going?

[msg MSG_002 [Futaba]]
Wait, that door won't open.

[msg MSG_003 [Yukari]]
Eheheh, I guess we gotta use the duct[n]again... Too bad there isn't any other[n]way around it.
