Guys! I'm sensing the herd of herbivores[n]just on the other side of this door!
But, something seems odd about them... I[n]wonder, could something be wrong?

[msg MSG_001 [Yosuke]]
Ah, geez... Looks like we'd better be[n]careful.
Joker, are we really ready to go?

[msg MSG_002 [Yosuke]]
Things might get dangerous past here.[n]You think we're ready to go?

[sel SEL_003 top]
Let's go.
I need a moment.

[msg MSG_004 [Yosuke]]
Alrightâ€•let's do this!

[msg MSG_005 [Yosuke]]
Gotcha. Nothin' to lose from getting as[n]ready as possible.
