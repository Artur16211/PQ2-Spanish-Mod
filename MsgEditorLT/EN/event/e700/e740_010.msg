Wha―The hell is this huge-ass stalk!?

[msg MSG_001 [Futaba]]
That's no ordinary stalk...
Looks like it has something to do with[n]that stump from earlier, too.

[msg MSG_002 [Yosuke]]
A stump? Oh, so this is some kind of[n]stage lift?

[msg MSG_003 [Rise]]
Mmhm―this one's currently raised up.

[msg MSG_004 [Naoto]]
In that case, if we flip the nose on[n]that tree stump, it should do something[n]with this stalk.

[msg MSG_005 [Futaba]]
If you wanna use that stage lift, you'll[n]have to go flip that tree stump's nose[n]switch!
