[msg MSG_000 [Kanji]]
Y'know, I've been wonderin'... Can you[n]fight?

[msg MSG_001 [Robot with a ribbon]]
NO. I HAVE NO BATTLE FUNCTIONS. PLEASE[n]REMEMBER THIS.

[msg MSG_002 [Futaba]]
Don't worry! All you gotta do is follow[n]us.

[msg MSG_003 [Yukari]]
Yeah, leave the fighting to us!

[msg MSG_004 [Robot with a ribbon]]
YOU ARE BRINGING ME ALONG, EVEN THOUGH I[n]CANNOT FIGHT? YOU DO NOT BENEFIT FROM[n]THIS. SO, WHY?

[sel SEL_005 top]
There is a benefit.
Just drop it and follow me.

[msg MSG_006 [Robot with a ribbon]]
TRUE, I CAN AT LEAST SERVE AS A[n]SHIELD...

[msg MSG_007 [Futaba]]
N-No living shields! Nobody asked you to[n]do that! Just follow us, okay?

[msg MSG_008 [Robot with a ribbon]]
BUT...

[msg MSG_009 [Kanji]]
Don't sweat all the details. C'mon,[n]let's go!

[msg MSG_030 [Yukari]]
Wait―going back to the movie theater is[n]fine for us, but what about her?

[msg MSG_031 [Yukiko]]
Now that you mention it―can she leave[n]this movie?

[msg MSG_032 [Mitsuru]]
I have no idea whether or not there[n]would be any ill effects for her...

[msg MSG_033 [Futaba]]
Precision machinery is very delicate. We[n]shouldn't bring her around any setting[n]that she's not designed for.

[msg MSG_034 [Chie]]
So should we try to hide her somewhere?[n]Oh, but what if she got caught by those[n]security robots?

[msg MSG_035 [Robot with a ribbon]]
IF THIS CONCERNS YOU, I BELIEVE THERE IS[n]A SOLUTION.
I SHOULD NOT BE IDENTIFIABLE TO THE[n]SECURITY ROBOTS' SENSORS IF I SUSPEND MY[n]OPERATIONS.

[msg MSG_036 [Naoto]]
Suspend your operations? Do you mean[n]power down?

[msg MSG_037 [Robot with a ribbon]]
NO. I HAVE A SLEEP MODE. I AM ABLE TO[n]TEMPORARILY AND HARMLESSLY SUSPEND[n]OPERATIONS.

[msg MSG_038 [Yusuke]]
Oh? That sounds useful. Then, I shall go[n]ahead and activate―

[msg MSG_039 [Ann]]
Hey! Don't go fiddling with her settings[n]without her permission!

[msg MSG_040 [Makoto]]
Even if you're able to avoid their[n]sensors, I'm concerned about just[n]leaving you here in the open.
Why don't you take cover somewhere[n]before engaging sleep mode?

[msg MSG_041 [P4 Hero]]
I agree. That definitely sounds like it[n]would be safer.
Well, our next goal is to find the[n]remaining members of SEES.
Let's go!
