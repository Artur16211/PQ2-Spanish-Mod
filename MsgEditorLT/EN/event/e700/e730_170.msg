Ack! Another robot!

[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
And we're at a dead end! What're we[n]gonna do!?

[msg MSG_002 [Mitsuru]]
The gate that alternates between open[n]and closed states is just up ahead...

[sel SEL_003 top]
Let's destroy the FOE.
Let's lead the FOE there.

[msg MSG_004 [Akihiko]]
What, we're destroying it with our[n]fists? In that case, leave it to me.

[msg MSG_005 [Shinjiro]]
Hey moron, there's no way you or anybody[n]is punching that thing and living to[n]talk about it!

[msg MSG_006 [Naoto]]
U-Um...
Wouldn't the closed door open up if we[n]led the pursuing FOE through the gate?

[msg MSG_007 [Akechi]]
Ah, that's a great idea.
If we have the pursuing FOE go through[n]the gate, the currently closed door will[n]open for us... Is that your plan?

[msg MSG_008 [Morgana]]
I can definitely see that working. Let's[n]give it a try, Joker!
