That reminds me, Joker. Is the map[n]coming along nicely?

[sel SEL_001 top]
Of course.
Honestly, I'm not sure...

[msg MSG_002 [Ann]]
Really? Can I see?

[msg MSG_003 [Akechi]]
...It would be a little better if you[n]drew in a few more details.

That way, we can search every inch of[n]the movie... It may even lead us to some[n]unexpected treasures.

Hikari was kind enough to give us this[n]notebook. Let's make good use of it!

But perhaps it'd be better if you[n]outlined the walls as well?

[msg MSG_006 [Yusuke]]
Indeed. I imagine that will help us see[n]both dead ends and paths we haven't yet[n]traveled.

[msg MSG_006_1 [Yusuke]]
It may also allow for smoother[n]exploration, and there'll be less chance[n]of us overlooking treasures as well.

Hikari was kind enough to give us this[n]notebook. Let's make good use of it!

[msg MSG_008 [Akechi]]
Hmm, looking good. The walls are[n]outlined, and we've explored every nook[n]and cranny thus far...
We can also see where we've yet to go,[n]so there doesn't appear to be any[n]issues. Most impressive.

[msg MSG_009 [Morgana]]
Looks like we haven't overlooked any[n]treasure either. You're making pretty[n]good use of that notebook!
We should thank Hikari for giving it to[n]us!
