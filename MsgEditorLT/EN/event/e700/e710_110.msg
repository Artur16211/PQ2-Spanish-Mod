Hm? Is that...?

[msg MSG_001 [Yusuke]]
As I thoughtâ€•they're stairs.

[msg MSG_002 [Futaba]]
Looks like they advance to the next[n]floor.
We haven't spotted Queen and Noir yet,[n]so it's best to keep on going.

[msg MSG_003 [Ann]]
So, we're supposed to head over there?[n]...I-I feel like we're going to lose[n]sight of it.

[msg MSG_004 [Akechi]]
Then, what if I do this... and put a[n]mark on the map?

[sel SEL_005 top]
Thanks.
Stop it.
......

[msg MSG_006 [Akechi]]
You're welcome. I'm glad if I was able[n]to be of use.

[msg MSG_007 [Yusuke]]
Indeed, it'll be easier to see that way.

[msg MSG_008 [Akechi]]
Come now, we know where to head next.[n]Let's look for a path that leads to[n]those stairs.

[msg MSG_009 [Akechi]]
Oh... Should I have minded my own[n]business? Sorry.
I won't go drawing things without your[n]permission from here on, so won't you[n]forgive me?
I'll erase it when we reach our[n]destination.

[msg MSG_010 [Ryuji]]
Ugh! C'mon, let's hurry up and get to[n]those stairs so that we can keep going!

[msg MSG_011 [Akechi]]
What's the matter?
Oh... Should I have minded my own[n]business?
I'm sorry. I'll erase it when we reach[n]our destination.

[msg MSG_012 [Yusuke]]
...At any rate, we've determined our[n]next destination. Let's first find a[n]path that leads to those stairs.
