[msg MSG_000 [Caroline]]
There you are, Inmate!

[msg MSG_001 [Justine]]
Is something the matter?

[sel SEL_002 top]
Something seems off...
Did you redecorate in here?

[msg MSG_003 [Caroline]]
What are you talking about? It's the[n]same as always in here.

[msg MSG_004 [Margaret]]
Perhaps it's due to Marie not being[n]present?
She's running a small errand at the[n]moment, but she should be back shortly.

[sel SEL_005 top]
An errand?
Where did she go?

[msg MSG_006 [Margaret]]
Oh, it's nothing at all important.
She seemed rather bored, so I sent her[n]to assist Theo with some shopping.

[msg MSG_007]
......?
There's something lying on the floor...

[msg MSG_008 [Caroline]]
Hm? What's that paper you have there?

[msg MSG_009 [Justine]]
Is that... some stationery?

[msg MSG_010 [Margaret]]
Oh, is that Marie's? She does that every[n]now and then... *chuckle*

[msg MSG_011]
It seems this stationery belongs to[n]Marie...
Something's been vigorously scrawled on[n]it...

[msg MSG_012 [Marie]]
"To the Heartless"

[msg MSG_013 [Marie]]
Crisis births opportunity! (DO YA GET[n]ME!?)
Hate the odds? That's how it works! (BUY[n]INTO IT!)
You hesitate? For what? (FOR WHOM!?)
Damned if you do! Damned if you don't![n](DAMN IT ALL!)
But... You still better take care of[n]yourself.
Got it? (L-O-V-E)

[msg MSG_014]
......
What exactly... is this?

[msg MSG_015 [Marie]]
Waaaaaaaah!

[msg MSG_016 [Marie]]
*pant* *pant*
Did―Did you read it!? Well!? DID YOU!?

[sel SEL_017 top]
I did.
I didn't.
I'm rather touched.

[msg MSG_018 [Marie]]
ARE YOU FOR REAL?

[msg MSG_019 [Marie]]
Oh no, you did read it! It's written on[n]your face! L-I-A-R!

[msg MSG_020 [Marie]]
YA MEAN IT!?
Ah―That smirk on your face! I knew it,[n]you L-I-A-R!

[msg MSG_021 [Marie]]
It-It's not what you think! These are[n]just words popping out of my head.[n]They're not poems or anything like that!
Why are you reading other people's[n]stuff, anyway!? For what!? For whom!?
C-Crisis births opportunity! Yeah, MY[n]opportunity! MINE!
......
StupidnosyheartlessjerkDAMNYOU! If you[n]go snooping through my pathos again,[n]you'll be sorry!

[msg MSG_022]
Marie is blushing...

[msg MSG_023 [Caroline]]
"You still better take care of[n]yourself"?
Or else what? Do you know, Justine?

[msg MSG_024 [Justine]]
"Damned if you do..."

[msg MSG_025 [Marie]]
STOOOOOOP! Stop quoting, stop quoting,[n]stop quoting!

[msg MSG_026 [Margaret]]
*chuckle*

[msg MSG_027 [Marie]]
Everyone's... so mean...

[msg MSG_028]
It looks like she really didn't want[n]anyone to read that...

[msg MSG_029 [Marie]]
How did this even end up there... I[n]don't understand.

[msg MSG_030]
Marie returned to her usual spot,[n]noticeably unsettled...
