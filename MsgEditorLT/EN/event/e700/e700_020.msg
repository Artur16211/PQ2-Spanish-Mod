Hey, look out! We've got incoming[n]enemies up ahead...
...Wait, what are these guys!? Shadows?

[msg MSG_001 [Ann]]
P-Probably? They seem different from the[n]usual ones we've seen, though...

[msg MSG_001_5 [Ann]]
Ugh, this makes no sense!

[msg MSG_002 [Makoto]]
At any rate, let's concentrate on[n]finding our way out of here as quickly[n]as possible.

[msg MSG_003 [Yusuke]]
She's right. We have policemen tailing[n]us... Skull, let's go handle them.

[msg MSG_004 [Ryuji]]
Got it! Let's do this!

[msg MSG_005 [Akechi]]
I'll assist as well. We'll leave the[n]ones on your end to you, Joker.
