It seemed we had reached a dead end...[n]We began thinking it may be best to turn[n]back.

[msg MSG_000_1 [P3 Fem Protag]]
...I was trying to sound like the[n]narrator you always hear in movies.[n]Could you tell?

[msg MSG_001 [Junpei]]
Uhh, I think it was a little too[n]subtle...

[msg MSG_002 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Aww, I've gotten used to this place, so[n]I wanted to say something fitting...

[msg MSG_003 [Haru]]
*giggle* Now that you mention it, movies[n]are often interjected with some form of[n]narration.
Considering we're the ones in the movie,[n]it's only natural we can't hear such[n]things on our end.

[msg MSG_004 [Ryuji]]
I'm interested in seein' how we look[n]from the theater seats.

[msg MSG_004_1 [Ryuji]]
I bet I look like some kinda Shadow[n]bashin' superstar...

[msg MSG_005 [Morgana]]
No need to worry. I watched you earlier.[n]You were still the same old thug you[n]usually are.

[msg MSG_006 [Ryuji]]
Whaâ€•!? Hey!

[msg MSG_007 [Morgana]]
Listen up, the characters that really[n]shine on the screen are those[n]overflowing with courage. Like me!
Everyone's charmed by how I cut down my[n]enemies and give my all to protect the[n]woman I love.

[msg MSG_008 [Yukiko]]
However, he had yet to realize...
The viewers were actually charmed by his[n]cute tail, pointy ears, and furry[n]paws...!

[msg MSG_009 [Morgana]]
What!?

[msg MSG_010 [Yukiko]]
I tried adding some narration too. How[n]was it?

[msg MSG_011 [Akechi]]
Haha, that's a fun game to play. I bet[n]it'd help boost our creativity.

[msg MSG_012 [Yukiko]]
The man laughed... but behind his smile,[n]there hid a terrible secret.

[msg MSG_013 [Akechi]]
Hm?

[msg MSG_014 [Yukiko]]
That secret was...

[msg MSG_014_1 [Yukiko]]
......
...I wonder what it would be.

[msg MSG_015 [Morgana]]
You didn't think one up!?

[msg MSG_016 [Yukiko]]
Following his retort, the cat thought,[n]"We should probably get going..."

[msg MSG_017 [Morgana]]
I am NOT a cat!
