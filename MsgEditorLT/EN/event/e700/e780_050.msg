[msg MSG_000 [Theodore]]
Welcome, everyone! I've been waiting for[n]you! Please, this way.

[msg MSG_001 [Theodore]]
Now, I hear you picked up a most[n]interesting find in the movie world!
If you don't mind, may I see it for[n]myself?

[msg MSG_002]
I show the [f 0 1 2]unidentified itemto[n]Theodore...

[msg MSG_003 [Theodore]]
Good heavens, the craftsmanship...! Like[n]an artisan's last masterpiece...
Such elegance in simplicity...! Truly,[n]it is a work of art, and nothing less.

[msg MSG_003_1 [Theodore]]
Now, curiosities like these usually[n]contain hidden power, but... it feels[n]oddly empty.

[sel SEL_004 top]
You can tell?
Can you fix it?

[msg MSG_005 [Theodore]]
Yes. I can usually sense a vestige of[n]its energy remaining...

[msg MSG_006 [Theodore]]
A work of this quality, well... I fear I[n]can't craft one myself...
But at the very least, I could reawaken[n]the power within it.

[msg MSG_006_1 [Theodore]]
If you happen to find any more, could[n]you bring them here?
If you'll allow me, I can reveal its[n]true value and [f 0 1 2]draw out its full power[f 0 1 0].

[msg MSG_002_05]
I told him how we threw the rest away,[n]not knowing their value...

[msg MSG_002_06 [Theodore]]
What...? How could you be so terribly,[n]tragically wasteful...?

[msg MSG_002_06_1 [Theodore]]
From what I know, they are all crafted[n]with skill and care. True masterpieces!
They are elegant, yet simple... Truly,[n]works of art in their own right.
I hear they are often vessels for hidden[n]power, though it has faded from some...

[sel SEL_002_07 top]
You can tell?
Can you fix them?

[msg MSG_002_08 [Theodore]]
Yes. I can usually sense a vestige of[n]its energy remaining...

[msg MSG_002_09 [Theodore]]
A work of that quality, well... I fear I[n]can't craft one myself...
But at the very least, I could reawaken[n]the power within one.

[msg MSG_002_09_1 [Theodore]]
If you happen to find any more, could[n]you bring them here?
If you'll allow me, I can reveal its[n]true value and [f 0 1 2]draw out its full power[f 0 1 0].

[msg MSG_007]
You are now able to [f 0 1 2]appraise[f 0 1 0][n]unidentified items and restore their[n]original power.

[msg MSG_008 [Theodore]]
I am at your service.
