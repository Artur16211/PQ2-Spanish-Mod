Well now, what's this...? I sense a[n]mysterious power among you...

[msg MSG_001 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Huh? You mean this shining card?

[msg MSG_002 [Margaret]]
This is... a Persona's...?

[msg MSG_003 [P3 Fem Protag]]
We got it off of a Shadow. Do you know[n]what it is?

[msg MSG_004 [Margaret]]
I certainly didn't expect to see this[n]outside the bounds of film... *chuckle*[n]Intriguing indeed.
Would you mind waiting a moment?

[msg MSG_005 [Margaret]]
Your patience is appreciated.
It would seem this card can impart the[n]power of a Persona.

[msg MSG_006 [Yukiko]]
Impart... power?

[msg MSG_007 [Margaret]]
Yes. Putting it another way, it allows[n]you to draw out a single ability from a[n]Persona.
...However, this power is unstable.[n]Ephemeral as it is, it may only last for[n]a brief instant.

[msg MSG_008 [Ann]]
It's that short? That's not gonna do[n]much for us, right?

[msg MSG_009 [Margaret]]
Not necessarily. If you use it in a[n]sacrifice fusion, you can pass its power[n]to another.

[msg MSG_010 [Naoto]]
I see. That does seem convenient...[n]assuming we can use it correctly.

[msg MSG_011 [Margaret]]
Yes. It's a fascinating find. Do try[n]it... at your leisure, of course.
I've made the preparations, so you can[n]attempt it whenever you please. Come by[n]if you feel so inclined.
