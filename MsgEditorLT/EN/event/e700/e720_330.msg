Crap, crap, crap, it's here! We'd better[n]run―fast!

[msg MSG_001 [Chie]]
Wh-What is that!? It's huuuge!
We won't last a minute if that thing[n]gets us!

[msg MSG_002 [Morgana]]
Um, uh, c-calm down... There's some[n]distance between it and us―we should be[n]okay... for now.
Plus, uhh... Look how scraggly its arms[n]and legs are, compared to the rest of[n]it! I bet it's really slow―just watch.

[msg MSG_003 [Teddie]]
Oh, okay then...
I was thinking about playing dead if we[n]were spotted, but maybe it's possible[n]for us to just run away instead.

[msg MSG_004 [Ryuji]]
Ooh, impressive! I guess we gotta ask an[n]animal when it comes to strategies[n]against other animals, eh...?

[msg MSG_005 [Morgana]]
Don't you start! Look where we are―[n]either we stop fussing about here, or we[n]get ourselves eaten.

[msg MSG_006 [P4 Hero]]
If we were caught by such a ferocious[n]FOE, we'd be dinosaur chow in no time.
Looks like we ought to proceed even more[n]cautiously than before.

Joker, let's [f 0 1 2]progress with a roundabout[n]path so that FOE can't catch up to us[f 0 1 0].
