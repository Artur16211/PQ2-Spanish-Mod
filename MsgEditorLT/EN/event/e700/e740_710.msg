Hold on―Doe's waiting just beyond[n]here... I'm not sure how I know that,[n]but that's the feeling I'm getting.

[msg MSG_001 [Futaba]]
I think Hikari's right. I'm getting a[n]strong reading from there too―now we[n]pretty much know why.

[msg MSG_002 [Hikari]]
Would you please come with me?

[msg MSG_003 [Hikari]]
I'm okay to do this... Won't you come[n]with me?

[sel SEL_004 top]
Of course.
I need just a moment.

[msg MSG_005 [Hikari]]
Thank you!

[msg MSG_006 [Hikari]]
Okay, I understand. Once you're ready,[n]would you accompany me inside?
