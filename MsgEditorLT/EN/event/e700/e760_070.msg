[msg MSG_000 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Huh? It's a dead end. Well, we might as[n]well take a break.

[msg MSG_001 [Yosuke]]
Ooh, I agree! This place has me sweating[n]like a pig.

[msg MSG_002 [Chie]]
Wouldn't it feel a little cooler if you[n]took off those headphones?

[msg MSG_003 [Yosuke]]
I don't wanna.
It's, like, my thing, you know...? Part[n]of my identity.

[msg MSG_004 [Chie]]
Well, your identity is giving you heat[n]rash.

[msg MSG_005 [Yosuke]]
Shuddup! Leave me alone!

[msg MSG_006 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I've been meaning to ask about them,[n]Yosuke-kun, but I noticed you wear[n]headphones too.
That's just like Futaba-chan and me.[n]Maybe we share some common interests!

[msg MSG_007 [Futaba]]
Ooh, now that you mention it, you're[n]right! We've got another audiophile[n]here!

[msg MSG_008 [Yosuke]]
Uh, well... It's not like I know much[n]about music or machines or anything.
I just like their design...

[msg MSG_009 [Kanji]]
But, Senpai, don't you play the guitar?

[msg MSG_010 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Whoa, really!? That's so cool!

[msg MSG_011 [P4 Hero]]
Yosuke has lots of different hobbies.[n]He's even started riding a motorcycle[n]lately.

[msg MSG_012 [Futaba]]
Wha―!? He's beginning to sound like[n]someone who actually has a life...

[msg MSG_013 [Yosuke]]
C'mon, it's not that big of a deal!

[msg MSG_014 [Teddie]]
Yosuke works hard too!
He always buys me ice cream and soda[n]with the money he makes working[n]part-time at Junes.

[msg MSG_015 [Yosuke]]
That's not a hobby... But, yeah, I don't[n]mind working.

[msg MSG_016 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Ooh, what else is there?

[msg MSG_017 [Chie]]
Let's see... I guess crashing his bike[n]and getting his head stuck in a garbage[n]can?

[msg MSG_018 [Yosuke]]
That was an accident!

[msg MSG_019 [Yukiko]]
He's crossdressed in front of the whole[n]school too. Really drew a crowd.

[msg MSG_020 [Yosuke]]
It's not like I planned on doing that![n]Also, we're not even talking about my[n]hobbies anymore!
There's a ton of other stuff about me[n]that's cool. Right, partner!?

[msg MSG_021 [P4 Hero]]
Right. Yosuke's actually really good at[n]playing the straight man.

[msg MSG_022 [Yosuke]]
Yeah, well, it's not hard when you've[n]got a team like ours―

[msg MSG_022_1 [Yosuke]]
Aw, partner, not you too!

[msg MSG_023 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I see, I see. You sure know how to have[n]fun, Yosuke-kun!

[msg MSG_024 [Yosuke]]
Look, I'm tellin' you, I...!
*sigh* Never mind. Getting worked up's[n]got me all sweaty again.

[msg MSG_025 [Naoto]]
Umm... Well then, perhaps we should get[n]going.
