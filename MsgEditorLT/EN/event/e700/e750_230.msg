Soooo... Did anything happen?

[msg MSG_001 [Akihiko]]
Well, it doesn't seem like anything's[n]changed...

[sel SEL_002 top]
Let's ask Oracle about it.
The air feels somehow different...

[msg MSG_003 [Futaba]]
'Kay, just a sec. Hmmmm... Fuuka, Rise,[n]what's your take on this?

[msg MSG_004 [Fuuka]]
Um... I think the air's changed a bit?

[msg MSG_005 [Rise]]
Mmhm, I feel it too. Maybe a [f 0 1 2]change in[n]the wind direction[f 0 1 0]?

[msg MSG_006 [Akihiko]]
Well, what do we do now? Where else[n]could we even look?

[msg MSG_007 [Akechi]]
...Could this have something to do with[n]that wind shield we saw earlier?

[msg MSG_007_1 [Akechi]]
Joker, why don't we go check that out[n]again?
