[msg MSG_000 [Chie]]
Hey [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]. Got a sec?
I've done my warm-ups already, so I'm[n]feeling pretty pumped.
I'm ready to beat the crap outta[n]anything! ...Y'know what I mean?
I think I could really shine if you put[n]me at the front!
Sorry if I seem overeager. I'm just...[n]in really great condition today!
I'll leave it at that, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]. Thanks in[n]advance!

Chie's pulling out all the stops. I bet[n]she'll kill it in combat today.[n]Literally!
Winning a battle is sometimes all about[n]the formation. Remember that!
