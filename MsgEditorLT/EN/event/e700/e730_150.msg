Hey, there's a some kind of weird robot[n]over there...

[msg MSG_001 [Rise]]
I'm getting an FOE reading from that[n]robot! Be careful, guys!

[msg MSG_002 [Mitsuru]]
I see, so that's an FOE...

[msg MSG_003 [Junpei]]
It [f 0 1 2]doesn't seem all that strong[f 0 1 0] compared[n]to what you guys told us, though.
It's just standin' there. Not too scary[n]to me.

[msg MSG_004 [Mitsuru]]
Don't make assumptions based on[n]appearances, Iori. We don't know what[n]it's capable of doing.

[msg MSG_005 [Junpei]]
Yeah, yeah, I'll be more careful.[n]Anyways, let's just avoid the thing and―

[msg MSG_006 [Fuuka]]
Oh! Everyone, I'm picking up another,[n]stronger FOE reading!

[msg MSG_007 [Junpei]]
Gotcha. So, where is it, Fuuka?

[msg MSG_008 [Fuuka]]
It seems to be moving? [f 0 1 2]It's getting[n]closer[f 0 1 0]...

[msg MSG_009 [Fuuka]]
Oh no! It's just to your left! Please be[n]careful!

[msg MSG_010 [Junpei]]
Left, huh...

[msg MSG_011 [Junpei]]
Wait, what the―!? That thing's[n]terrifying! What's the deal with its[n]hands?
Are those for... p-pummeling us? Oh, I'm[n]gonna freak out! That thing is like[n]Queen-level scary!

[msg MSG_012 [Makoto]]
Hey, what do you mean by that!?
I'm not that scary... am I?

[msg MSG_013 [Shinjiro]]
Hey! Now ain't the time for jokes! If we[n]don't run, we're screwed!

[sel SEL_014 top]
Let's find a way past it.
Let's head back.

[msg MSG_015 [Mitsuru]]
Understood. Let's take the path behind[n]us!

[msg MSG_016 [Akechi]]
Wait, Joker! That won't do us any good[n]now.
It'd be wiser to take the path behind[n]us.

[msg MSG_017 [Junpei]]
Alright, now that that we've reached an[n]agreement on our direction...
RUUUUUUUN!
