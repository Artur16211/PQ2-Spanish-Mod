Hm...

[msg MSG_001 [Ann]]
What's up, Fox?

[msg MSG_002 [Yusuke]]
Well, I was thinking that it may be a[n]good idea to come up with a specific[n]mark for the cages...

[msg MSG_003 [Akechi]]
Yes, that does sound like a good idea.
I think having one especially for those[n]cages would be useful when noting them[n]on the map.

[sel SEL_004 top]
I want one of those too.
Is that really necessary?

[msg MSG_005 [Yusuke]]
All right, how about something like[n]this?

[msg MSG_006 [Yusuke]]
Hmm... Allow me to offer an example,[n]just in case.
How about something like this?

[msg MSG_007 [Akechi]]
Well, there's no downside to making the[n]map easier for us to read. Why not make[n]use of it after all?

[msg MSG_ICON_KAITEN_KABE_OPE]
A [f 0 1 2]Rotating Cage[f 0 1 0] icon has been added to[n]the map on the bottom screen.
If you wish to check how to use this[n]icon once more...
Press [f 0 1 2]HELP[f 0 1 0] at the bottom right of the[n]map and check the [f 0 1 2]Icon Types[f 0 1 0].
