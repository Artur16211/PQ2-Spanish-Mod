Oh, look―dwarves! They're kinda cute!

[msg MSG_001 [Fuuka]]
Wait―Panther! Don't go near them!

[msg MSG_002 [Ann]]
Eh?
...Aaaah!

[msg MSG_003 [Morgana]]
Look out!

[msg MSG_004 [Morgana]]
Whew! That was close. Are you all right,[n]Panther?

[msg MSG_005 [Ann]]
Y-Yeah... Thanks, Mona. You saved my[n]butt back there.

[msg MSG_006 [Morgana]]
Meow!? Th-Th-That was nya-thing!
For you, Panther, I'd brave fire and[n]ice... Wind and waves... Dwarves with[n]guns!

[msg MSG_007 [Yukari]]
Ooh, bravo, Mona! I'm surprised you[n]could move that fast. I guess it's[n]thanks to the power of love?
It must've been scary to end up in the[n]crosshairs so suddenly.

From what we've witnessed, they seem to[n][f 0 1 2]point their guns at anything standing[n]before them[f 0 1 0].
We won't be able to avoid a fight if[n]they lock onto us... Be careful around[n]those guys, Joker.
