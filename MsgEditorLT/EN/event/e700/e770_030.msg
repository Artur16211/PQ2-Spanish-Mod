Huh? What's this? A scrap of paper?

[msg MSG_001 [Yukari]]
What, that's it? What a letdown.

[msg MSG_002 [Morgana]]
Wait a minute, you guys.
If my veteran phantom thief intuition is[n]correct...

[msg MSG_002_1 [Morgana]]
Then this is a map that marks the spot[n]of some fancy hidden treasure!

[msg MSG_003 [Ken]]
What!?

[msg MSG_004 [Koromaru]]
Arf!?

[msg MSG_005 [Yukari]]
Seriously? Well, I certainly do see[n]marks on there.

[msg MSG_006 [Ken]]
An actual treasure map, with actual[n]hidden treasure...? That's so cool![n]Let's go find it right now!

[msg MSG_007 [Yosuke]]
Uh, wow... Ken's way more excited about[n]this than I would've expected...

[sel SEL_008 top]
It's the sense of adventure.
He's still a kid.

[msg MSG_009 [Junpei]]
Are you the adventuring type too, Joker?[n]I'm kind of a fan myself!

[msg MSG_010 [Ken]]
N-No, I'm not!
I just... thought that we might find[n]something useful for our journey...

[msg MSG_011 [Haru]]
*giggle* It does sound kind of exciting[n]to follow a treasure map.
Say, how about we put this treasure map[n]on top of our movie map? Then we'd know[n]the location.

[msg MSG_012 [Futaba]]
Not a bad idea. I'll take care of this!
Hrrm... So, according to this, that[n]place is here, and that one is there...

[msg MSG_013 [Futaba]]
So then... this gotta be here, on the[n]map! Hehe, perfect orienting, if I do[n]say so myself.
Now, let's go see what kind of treasure[n]is waiting for us...
