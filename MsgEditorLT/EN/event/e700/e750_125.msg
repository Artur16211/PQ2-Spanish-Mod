Whoa!? What was that noise!?

[msg MSG_001 [Akechi]]
Perhaps that FOE [f 0 1 2]destroyed the[n]debristhat we saw earlier?

[msg MSG_002 [Fuuka]]
I'll check on that for you. Let's see...

[msg MSG_003 [Fuuka]]
Wow, incredible! All that debris really[n]did get blown away!

[msg MSG_004 [Yosuke]]
Man, that thing really is too strong. If[n]it ever catches us, we're done for...

[msg MSG_005 [Akechi]]
Don't worry. We just need to make sure[n]we stay well ahead of it.
Furthermore, we know now thatblocked[n]paths can be opened up if we make use of[n]that FOE[f 0 1 0].
When we come across a path obstructed[n]with debris, we can get rid of it the[n]same way we just did.

[msg MSG_006 [Morgana]]
Right. When the time comes, make sure[n]you lure the FOE towards the debris,[n]Joker!
