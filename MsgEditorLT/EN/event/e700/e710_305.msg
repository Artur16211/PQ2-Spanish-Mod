You know, there's something about the[n]citizens here... They're sort of eerie.

[msg MSG_001 [Ann]]
Oh, you got that feeling too,-chan?

[msg MSG_002 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Everyone's trying to convince themselves[n]that a hero of justice is always right[n]and can do no wrong...

[msg MSG_002_5 [P3 Fem Protag]]
But it's like they refuse to think about[n]what really matters: figuring out what[n]justice actually is...
It's like they're just going with the[n]flowâ€• the justice here is absolute, all[n]because they're told it is.

[msg MSG_003 [Ryuji]]
Yeah, none of 'em are even tryin' to[n]think for themselves...
Kamoshidaman ain't right in the first[n]place, but these people don't make any[n]sense, either!

[msg MSG_004 [Ann]]
If anything goes in the name of justice,[n]this place is nastier than Kamoshida[n]before his heart was changed.

[msg MSG_005 [Morgana]]
Well, that's even more of a reason for[n]us to not dally around here, then.
Let's hurry up with the rescue[n]operation.
