What're those doing here?

They're most likely [f 0 1 2]searchlights[f 0 1 0].

They may be for spotting us...
Or, they could be using them to keep a[n]close watch on all of the citizens...
All for the sake of not letting this[n]"evil" they speak about escape.

[msg MSG_007 [Ryuji]]
Ugh, talk about being effin'[n]disgusting... It makes me wanna destroy[n]the things!

[msg MSG_008 [Futaba]]
I get you, but be cautious! It'll be a[n]real hassle if you get caught by the[n]enemy...
Make sure you [f 0 1 2]avoid the searchlights[n]while proceeding[f 0 1 0], okay?
