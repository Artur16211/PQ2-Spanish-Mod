Hm? I've spotted a bear.

[msg MSG_001 [Teddie]]
Ahoy! You called?

[msg MSG_002 [Yusuke]]
Such incredible speed...

[msg MSG_003 [Teddie]]
Heheheh! As such a smart bear, I'm[n]capable of lightning-quick replies!

[msg MSG_004 [Junpei]]
Helloooo, Teddie? Look over there, why[n]don'tcha?

[msg MSG_005 [Teddie]]
Hrmm? What do you―

[msg MSG_006 [Teddie]]
Wait―what's this!? I-I-I spot a bear!?

[msg MSG_007 [Teddie]]
And, it's insanely fast!?

[msg MSG_008 [Akihiko]]
It's got the body of a heavyweight, but[n]the agility of a featherweight... What[n]an impressive opponent!

[msg MSG_009 [Mitsuru]]
No matter how quick it is, [f 0 1 2]it must have[n]some kind of pattern like the other[n]FOEswe've encountered thus far.
If we carefully track its movement, it[n]shouldn't pose a threat to us... Good[n]luck, Joker.
