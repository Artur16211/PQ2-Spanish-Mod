It's a dead end... Just a bunch of movie[n]posters.

[msg MSG_001 [Hikari]]
Oh, this movie!

[msg MSG_002 [Ann]]
You recognize it, Hikari? Is that a[n]famous one?

[msg MSG_003 [Hikari]]
Not really―I was just reminded of this[n]one movie I love...

[msg MSG_004 [Ryuji]]
Oh yeah? What makes it so good?

[msg MSG_005 [Hikari]]
It's hard to explain, but you can tell[n]it's full of the director's care.
The music and art direction are[n]wonderful, too. The movie is really[n]heartwarming.
There aren't any famous stars or[n]expensive effects in it...
But that movie showed me how you don't[n]need to rely on those things to touch[n]the audiences' hearts.

[msg MSG_006 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Wow, it must be really good! I kinda[n]wanna see it too, now.

[msg MSG_007 [Yosuke]]
Movies are supposed to be nice―like how[n]Hikari-chan described that one...
But the only ones playing here are all[n]negative... It's a real bummer.

[msg MSG_008 [Ann]]
I want to hurry up and make all the[n]theatergoers remember that movies aren't[n]supposed to be like those ones.
We have to stop Enlil before it's too[n]late.

[msg MSG_009 [Hikari]]
Mmhm. I know firsthand that watching[n]movies is easier than dealing with[n]reality...
But every person should still make an[n]effort towards leaving here.

[msg MSG_010 [Morgana]]
Including us. Let's keep going!
