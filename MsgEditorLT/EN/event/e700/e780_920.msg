So you've returned, Inmate.

[msg MSG_001]
......?
Marie is once again nowhere to be[n]seen...

[msg MSG_002 [Margaret]]
Ah, welcome to the Velvet Room.
Marie is unfortunately away at this[n]time.

[msg MSG_003]
......?
There's another piece of stationery on[n]the floor...

[msg MSG_004 [Caroline]]
Another one? What's it about now?

[msg MSG_005]
Something is written on it with large,[n]curly handwriting...

[msg MSG_006 [Marie]]
"The Mongrels' Lullaby"

[msg MSG_007 [Marie]]
You are a stupid dog you don't even know[n]your true master yet you wag your tail[n]so hard it may very well tear
I am a stupid dog I search for my true[n]master though I've never even seen him
This world's a fluffy paradise for mutts[n]like us...

[msg MSG_008]
......
Is this another one of Marie's poems?

[msg MSG_009 [Marie]]
Nwaaaaaaaaah!

[msg MSG_010 [Marie]]
A-Again!? You did it again!? Why how[n]could you I don't understand―
I'm not looking for any master! I[n]just... saw a stray dog! In a movie!
......
GawdIhateyoustupidfluffypermhead! This[n]is gonna be YOUR lullaby, by the time[n]I'm through with you!

[msg MSG_011]
Marie is blushing...

[msg MSG_012 [Caroline]]
Lullaby... what is this thing?

[msg MSG_013 [Justine]]
It's a song that induces sleep. For you[n]see, the mongrels―

[msg MSG_014 [Marie]]
Stop! Don't explain it! I'll put you to[n]sleep sweet dreams good night baby!

[msg MSG_015 [Marie]]
What's this doing here... It doesn't[n]make any sense...

[msg MSG_016]
Marie returned to her usual spot,[n]noticeably unsettled...
