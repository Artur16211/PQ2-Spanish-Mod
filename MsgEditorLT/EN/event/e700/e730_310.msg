Ooh, I spy the stairs! I bet we can make[n]it to the next floor real soon.

[msg MSG_001 [Yukiko]]
But, isn't that lattice in front of it[n]pretty much a wall?
It seems that we can't go straight[n]there.

[msg MSG_002 [Junpei]]
Then, how about...

[msg MSG_003 [Junpei]]
Ooh, I spy a door up ahead!

[msg MSG_004 [Rise]]
Wait a secâ€•I'm getting an enemy reading[n]beyond that door. Be careful!

[msg MSG_005 [Junpei]]
O-Oh...
...I spy no other way!

[msg MSG_006 [Ryuji]]
Hmm, this level of disappointment... It[n]reminds me of somebody else...

[msg MSG_007 [Yosuke]]
You rang?

[msg MSG_008 [Ryuji]]
Not at all!
*sigh* So, there's an enemy through this[n]door? We can at least get ready for it!
