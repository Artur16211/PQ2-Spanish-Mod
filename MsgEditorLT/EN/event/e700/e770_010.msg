[msg MSG_000 [Ryuji]]
Huh? The hell's this?

[msg MSG_001 [Akechi]]
Hmm... It looks like they're...[n]coordinates?

[msg MSG_002 [Ann]]
But why would they be in a treasure[n]chest?

[msg MSG_003 [Morgana]]
C'mon guys! Am I the only one here with[n]a working brain?

[msg MSG_003_1 [Morgana]]
It could only be a treasure map!

[msg MSG_004 [Futaba]]
Yeah, it's gotta be! Smart, Mona!

[msg MSG_005 [Ryuji]]
Is it all that smart, though?

[sel SEL_006 top]
Of course not; he's just guessing!
He's on to something!

[msg MSG_007 [Ann]]
I agree. It's not like we know for sure[n]if it's actually a treasure map...

[msg MSG_008 [P3 Fem Protag]]
But we shouldn't rule it out! Let's have[n]Oracle take a look.

[msg MSG_009 [Ryuji]]
So you're taking his side.
Fine, whatever. It ain't like I can[n]figure out what it is.

[msg MSG_010 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Yeah, maybe it's real. Let's have Oracle[n]take a look.

[msg MSG_011 [Futaba]]
Hm... Looking at these coordinates...[n]It's here, here...

[msg MSG_012 [Futaba]]
...And here! Hell yeah, we gotta check[n]all three spots!
