Um... Could I say something?

[msg MSG_001 [Akihiko]]
Hm? What's up?

[msg MSG_002 [Ken]]
So, ah... About this floor...
If we hit the switch while standing on[n]the lift, [f 0 1 2]wouldn't it take us to the[n]next floor down[f 0 1 0]?

[sel SEL_003 top]
That's a great idea.
Do you think we'd be safe?

[msg MSG_004 [Akechi]]
True, we could use it like we do the[n]stairs. I think it's worth a try.
Well, that is IF it stops at the floor[n]below us. We could just end up[n]descending forever instead...

[msg MSG_005 [Akechi]]
True, it'd be great IF it connected to[n]the next floor down―but we may just end[n]up descending forever instead...

[msg MSG_006 [Ken]]
Wha―Huh!? Noooo!

[msg MSG_007 [Akechi]]
...Haha, I'm just joking. If it seems[n]suspicious, we should just ask our[n]navigators.

[msg MSG_008 [Rise]]
I had a feeling you were gonna say that,[n]so we've already checked! No worries― it[n]stops at the next floor down!

[msg MSG_009 [Ken]]
Really? Oh, thank goodness!

[msg MSG_010 [Yosuke]]
Well then, let's hop on and―

[msg MSG_011 [Futaba]]
Whoa, wait a sec there! You'd better[n]mark this on your map before you go[n]flippin' any tree noses.
Moving up and down on these will most[n]likely complicate your map-making.

[msg MSG_012 [Yusuke]]
In that case, it'd be best if we had a[n]symbol specifically for these. Allow me[n]to design one for you...

[msg MSG_013 [Yosuke]]
Thanks! Now that that's covered―let's[n]try it out, Joker!

[msg MSG_ICON_SERI_OPEN]
A [f 0 1 2]Stage Lift[f 0 1 0] icon has been added to the[n]map on the bottom screen.
If you wish to check how to use this[n]icon once more...
Press [f 0 1 2]HELP[f 0 1 0] at the bottom right of the[n]map and check the [f 0 1 2]Icon Types[f 0 1 0].
