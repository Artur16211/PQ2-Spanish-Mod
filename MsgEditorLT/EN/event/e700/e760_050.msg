Well, can't go this way. Guess we'll[n]just haftaâ€•

[msg MSG_001 [Kanji]]
Whoa!
Check out those bones! They're huge!

[msg MSG_002 [Yusuke]]
How magnificent... The shape and[n]smoothness... You couldn't possibly[n]recreate such natural beauty!

[msg MSG_002_1 [Yusuke]]
Just imagine how this creature roamed[n]about these lands! Truly inspiring!

[msg MSG_003 [Ryuji]]
Oh, yo! Couldn't we take this back with[n]us and get it made into a weapon?

[msg MSG_004 [Futaba]]
Ooh, dinosaur bone weapons would be a[n]dream come true!

[sel SEL_005 top]
That'd be pretty exotic.
Really?
I'm more interested in the meat.

[msg MSG_006 [Akechi]]
Weapons made from bones, hm...? You[n]don't really see those outside of[n]movies, so that could be interesting.
But I'd be a bit worried about how[n]brittle they are. These bones seem to be[n]rather weathered after all.

[msg MSG_007 [P4 Hero]]
Yeah. It's unfortunate, but they're[n]probably not suited for any kind of[n]combat.

[msg MSG_008 [Akechi]]
I think it's an interesting idea. You[n]don't really see those in the real[n]world.
But I'd be a bit worried about how[n]brittle they are. These bones seem to be[n]rather weathered after all.

[msg MSG_009 [P4 Hero]]
Yeah. It's unfortunate, but they're[n]probably not suited for any kind of[n]combat.

[msg MSG_010 [Chie]]
Hey, me too! I'll take meat over bones[n]any day! Waaay more important!

[msg MSG_011 [Akechi]]
Haha... It seems Satonaka-san and Joker[n]are more interested in the meat.
Personally, I would enjoy seeing a[n]weapon made from dinosaur bones.
But that might prove somewhat difficult.[n]These bones seem to be rather weathered[n]after all.

[msg MSG_012 [P4 Hero]]
Yeah. It's unfortunate, but they're[n]probably not suited for any kind of[n]combat.

[msg MSG_013 [Chie]]
Bones... Bones... Short ribs... Dinosaur[n]short ribs...

[msg MSG_014 [Makoto]]
Wait, don't tell me you want to try[n]eating some!?

[msg MSG_015 [Yukiko]]
I'd like to try some as well. I imagine[n]it'd be both filling and energizing.

[msg MSG_016 [Futaba]]
M-M-Me too! I saw a giant hunk of[n]dinosaur meat in a cartoon one time, and[n]I've wanted to eat some ever since!

[msg MSG_017 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I'm also curious about how it tastes. I[n]call dibs on the drumsticks!

[msg MSG_018 [Makoto]]
Ngh... Am I the odd one out here?
I mean, we're talking about eating[n]dinosaurs... That's just...

[msg MSG_019 [Haru]]
Hmm, I was a little curious myself, but[n]I believe I'd be hesitant to actually[n]take a bite...

[msg MSG_020 [Makoto]]
R-Right!? Thank goodness, I thought I[n]was the only one...

[msg MSG_021 [Haru]]
Truthfully, I think coffee made from[n]herbivorous dinosaur dung would be[n]tastier, don't you?

[msg MSG_022 [Makoto]]
...Sure. Whatever you say.

[msg MSG_023 [Futaba]]
*gasp* Queen's stopped thinking for[n]herself!

[msg MSG_024 [P4 Hero]]
...Your team's quite a cast of[n]characters, isn't it?

[msg MSG_025 [Morgana]]
So is yours...
