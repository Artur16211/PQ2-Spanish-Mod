There's some red fruit growing here...

[msg MSG_001 [Yusuke]]
Oh? You noticed it too, Joker? They look[n]edible enough... What do you think?
I'd say it's worth trying... I think[n]I'll take a bite.

[msg MSG_002 [Ann]]
Whoa, Fox, what are you doing? That[n]looks like it'll give you a stomach[n]ache!

[msg MSG_003 [Teddie]]
There's no need to worry! I've already[n]tasted it!
It's crispy and bursting with juices...[n]Even a gourmet like myself thinks it's[n]delicious!

[msg MSG_003_1 [Teddie]]
Sooo, I'm gonna go for seconds.

[msg MSG_004 [Yusuke]]
Hrm!? Wait, leave some for me!

[msg MSG_005 [Ann]]
Oh, sheesh! Say something, Joker!

[sel SEL_006 top]
Enjoy.
Hey, stop!
Let's eat!

[msg MSG_007 [Makoto]]
You're gonna let them eat it!?

[msg MSG_007_1 [Makoto]]
Some poisons are slow-acting. Teddie's[n]taste test doesn't guarantee that it's[n]safe to―

[msg MSG_008 [Makoto]]
You heard him. We're asking for trouble[n]at this point, so we shouldn't―

[msg MSG_009 [Makoto]]
*sigh* You too, Joker?

[msg MSG_009_1 [Makoto]]
It's dangerous to just carelessly[n]consume something we know nothing about.
Some poisons are slow-acting. As our[n]leader, you should try having a better[n]sense of danger, and―

[msg MSG_010 [Yusuke]]
Mm... That was delicious.

[msg MSG_011 [Makoto]]
No way! You're finished already?

[msg MSG_012 [Yusuke]]
Underneath the refreshing acidity lies a[n]thick, honey-like sweetness... I give it[n]three stars!

[msg MSG_013 [Teddie]]
See, I told you! C'mon, everyone, eat[n]up!

[msg MSG_013_1 [Teddie]]
...Wait, hragh!?

[msg MSG_013_2 [Teddie]]
Owww, oww! My tummy huuurts!

[msg MSG_014 [Yusuke]]
Hgh... It... My stomach's...!

[msg MSG_015 [Ann]]
We tried to stop you! You've got to go[n]throw up right now!

[msg MSG_016 [Teddie]]
Hraaaarghhh... I... I think I see a[n]field of beautiful flowers...

[msg MSG_017 [Yusuke]]
Me too... I'm seeing a mountain of[n]expensive sushi... Might this be heaven?

[msg MSG_018 [P4 Hero]]
Hang in there, you two! We'll head back[n]and have Margaret make an antidote...!

[msg MSG_019 [Teddie]]
...Hrm? Now I feel strangely awake.

[msg MSG_020 [Yusuke]]
...Hm? Yes, I feel the same.
It's as if I'm being reborn on the[n]inside... What is this sensation?

[msg MSG_DAMAGE_KUMA]
Teddie lost some HP!

[msg MSG_DAMAGE_YUSUKE]
Yusuke lost some HP!

[msg MSG_CURE_SP]
Yusuke and Teddie recovered some SP!

[msg MSG_021 [Akechi]]
I see. That fruit seems to have some[n]sort of awakening effect.
Still, it's too dangerous to eat.[n]There's clearly some side effects as[n]well.

[msg MSG_022 [Yusuke]]
True. However, it's better than being[n]hungry. That stomach pain was too much[n]to bear...

[msg MSG_022_1 [Yusuke]]
Furthermore, that refreshing feeling is[n]somewhat addictive. Perhaps I'll have[n]another...

[msg MSG_023 [Makoto]]
Stop that!
*sigh* It's dangerous to stick around[n]here any longer. Let's go, Joker.
