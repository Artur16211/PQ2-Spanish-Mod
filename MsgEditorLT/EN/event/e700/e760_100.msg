It appears to be a dead end. We should[n]turn back.

[msg MSG_001 [Teddie]]
One more step, and my back's done for...[n]It's time for a break.

[msg MSG_002 [Yosuke]]
You know, if you're tiring out this[n]fast, your hourly wage's never gonna go[n]up.

[msg MSG_003 [Teddie]]
I'm tired of working, I'm tired of going[n]to the gym, and this is something that I[n]definitely can not handle!

[msg MSG_004 [Yosuke]]
Sheesh... It'd be nice to find a[n]part-timer who's actually willing to[n]work for once.
There are plenty of robots around here.[n]Maybe Junes could hire one of them...

[msg MSG_005 [Teddie]]
W-Wait, Yosuke! You're... You're not[n]gonna abandon me, are you?

[msg MSG_005_1 [Teddie]]
Ohhh, how cruel... You've toyed with me[n]all this time and now you're dumping[n]me...?

[msg MSG_006 [Yosuke]]
Don't phrase it like that!

[msg MSG_007 [Fuuka]]
*giggle* Honestly, I'm curious about the[n]robots too.
Such detailed actions would require some[n]truly impressive technology. I wonder[n]what their AI is like...

[msg MSG_008 [Futaba]]
Y-You like that kinda stuff?

[msg MSG_009 [Fuuka]]
Mhm. I quite enjoy tinkering with[n]machines and whatnot...

[msg MSG_010 [Futaba]]
Ooh, you're a hardware specialist! I'm[n]more of a software girl myself...
I bet, if we worked together, we'd be[n]able to create a life-sized Featherman[n]Robot!

[msg MSG_011 [Fuuka]]
That sounds fun! I'm sure we could work[n]in plenty of neat gimmicks...

[msg MSG_012 [Futaba]]
Mmmhm, the first thing we'll wanna shoot[n]for is 100,000 horse power! I say we add[n]in a transformation function too!

[msg MSG_013 [Makoto]]
Looks like they've hit it off.

[msg MSG_014 [Ryuji]]
If we leave 'em be, they're gonna be[n]talkin' forever. Let's find a good place[n]to stop 'em, and keep going.
