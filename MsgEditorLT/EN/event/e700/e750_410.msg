Hey―ain't that glowing part of the floor[n]one of those switches?

[msg MSG_001 [Yusuke]]
Hmm. That should mean there's a wind[n]generator nearby...
But there doesn't seem to be anything we[n]can do about it from here.

[msg MSG_002 [Akechi]]
Actually, I think there might be a way:[n]look just beyond it.

[msg MSG_003 [Morgana]]
One of those copyca―mimicking FOEs, huh?[n]I see... Get what he means, Joker?

[sel SEL_004 top]
...Nope.
We'll get that thing to activate it.

[msg MSG_005 [Morgana]]
We want to get over there, but we can't,[n]because there's no wind blowing―right?

[msg MSG_006 [Morgana]]
Nice―quick on the take, as always.

[msg MSG_007 [Chie]]
Uh, I kinda don't get it at all,[n]eheheh...

[msg MSG_008 [Morgana]]
We want to get over there, but we can't,[n]because there's no wind blowing―right?

[msg MSG_009 [Ken]]
Yeah. We don't have a way to reach the[n]switch that we need to activate.

[msg MSG_010 [Akechi]]
And that's why we're going to have the[n]FOE activate it for us. It copies our[n]movement, right?
So why not take advantage of its[n]behavior and [f 0 1 2]have the FOE move onto that[n]switch[f 0 1 0]?

[msg MSG_011 [Yosuke]]
Oh, I get it! Then the wind that we need[n]will start blowing!

[msg MSG_012 [Naoto]]
If this works as we've planned, we[n]should be able to ride the wind to the[n]other side.
There doesn't seem to be any alternative[n]solution, so let's give this a try.
