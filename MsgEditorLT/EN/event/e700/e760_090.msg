...It's a dead end.
Still, this place is eerily quiet. It[n]looks like humans really don't exist[n]around here.

[msg MSG_001 [Haru]]
This is a world where mankind has gone[n]extinct, correct?
I was thinking that perhaps we'd come[n]across someone somewhere, but I haven't[n]seen anyone...

[sel SEL_002 top]
They're hiding.
They've all been frozen.

[msg MSG_003 [Mitsuru]]
Hiding...? Are you saying they're[n]forming some sort of resistance?

[msg MSG_004 [Futaba]]
That sounds so cool!
Like, they're lurking deep underground,[n]just waiting for the right moment to[n]finally rise up against the machines...!

[msg MSG_005 [Ryuji]]
Yeah, right! There's no way!

[msg MSG_006 [Akechi]]
Perhaps what's left of humanity is being[n]kept in a cryogenic sleep somewhere?

[msg MSG_007 [Akechi]]
Ah, I was thinking the same thing.
Perhaps what's left of humanity is being[n]kept in a cryogenic sleep somewhere?

[msg MSG_008 [Naoto]]
I see. There's a possibility they're[n]being stored in large numbers and turned[n]into living batteries...

[msg MSG_009 [Akechi]]
In a way, using humans as a natural[n]resource would be the ultimate form of[n]eco-friendliness. I'm rather intrigued.

[msg MSG_010 [Yosuke]]
Nope! No way! You guys are scaring me,[n]talkin' like that!

[msg MSG_011 [Morgana]]
Okay, everyone, enough daydreaming for[n]now. We should get going.
