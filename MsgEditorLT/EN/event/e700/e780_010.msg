[msg MSG_001 [Caroline]]
You here again, Inmate!? I told you[n]we're not ready yet!

[msg MSG_002 [Justine]]
Is there something else?

[sel SEL_003 top]
Just here to make small talk.
Tell me about Sub-Personas.
No, I'll leave.

[msg MSG_004 [Caroline]]
Hmph! Like you have time for small talk,[n]Inmate.
If you think you can relax just because[n]you're not in your cell, you're wrong!

[msg MSG_005 [Justine]]
It is our duty to rehabilitate you.
If necessary, we can accommodate.

[msg MSG_006 [Caroline]]
You better be thankful, Inmate!

[msg MSG_007 [Caroline]]
Sheesh, you're needy. Fine, listen up.

[msg MSG_008 [Justine]]
It seems to be that the way things work[n]in this world is quite different from[n]that of our own.
Your power of the wild card that allows[n]you to switch Personas during battle is[n]no longer available.

[msg MSG_009 [Caroline]]
Still, it looks like things aren't all[n]bad! So cheer up!

[msg MSG_010 [Justine]]
Here, everyone will be able to equipone[n]additional Persona[f 0 1 0].

[msg MSG_011 [Caroline]]
Not just you, Inmate. Everyone. You hear[n]me!?

[msg MSG_012 [Justine]]
We will call everyone's standard Persona[n]their [f 0 1 2]"Main Persona"[f 0 1 0]...
And those you obtain from the film, we[n]will call [f 0 1 2]"Sub-Personas"[f 0 1 0].

[msg MSG_013 [Caroline]]
In other words, all of you can usetwo[n]Personas[f 0 1 0], one "Main" and one "Sub."

[msg MSG_014 [Justine]]
I am uncertain as to why the power of[n]the wild card has changed. However...
There may be other things we can assist[n]with as far as Sub-Personas are[n]concerned.

[msg MSG_015 [Caroline]]
Until then, all of you better keep doing[n]what needs to be done! Got it!?

[msg MSG_020 [Justine]]
You're heading back?

[msg MSG_021 [Caroline]]
Your current mission is to escape this[n]world!
This is part of your rehabilitation.[n]Don't forget it, Inmate!
