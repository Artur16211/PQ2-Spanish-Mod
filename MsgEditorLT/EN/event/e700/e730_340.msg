Oooh! Th-This is...

[msg MSG_001 [Yukiko]]
Oh, it's that machine we saw earlier.[n]What could it be?

[msg MSG_002 [Futaba]]
Hmm... After a quick once-over, it seems[n]to be spatially connected to another[n]location.
Simply put: it's a [f 0 1 2]warp device[f 0 1 0]!

[msg MSG_003 [Kanji]]
Can you tell where it goes?

[msg MSG_004 [Fuuka]]
No, I'm sorry. All I know is that it's[n]somewhere on this floor... I can't give[n]a more precise location.

[msg MSG_005 [Haru]]
If there's no alternative, then we'll[n]just have to try stepping into it...
But, we should leave that decision to[n]you, Joker.
You've been the one mapping all this[n]time, so I think you'd be most familiar[n]with the area's layout.
