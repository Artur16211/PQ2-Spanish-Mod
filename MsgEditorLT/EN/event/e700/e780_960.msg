Ah, so you're here...

[msg MSG_001]
......?
Marie is, as usual, nowhere to be[n]found...

[msg MSG_002 [Justine]]
...Are you looking for Marie? She's[n]conducting an errand for Margaret...

[msg MSG_003]
......?
There's another piece of stationery on[n]the floor...
I can see something written on it, done[n]with heavy emotionally-laden strokes...

[msg MSG_004 [Marie]]
"The Seven Deadly Sins"

[msg MSG_005 [Marie]]
The angel is fallen, guilty of seven[n]deadly sins.
The first is gluttony I taste the[n]forbidden fruit
The second is sloth I stay in bed, my[n]sanctuary
The third is greed I want it all, yes, I[n]want it all
The fourth is jealousy I hate that girl[n]you talk with
The fifth is wrath Why don't you realize[n]how I feel?
The sixth is pride When I'm with you, I[n]masquerade as an angel even as envy[n]burns within me
The seventh is lust Oh, don't ask,[n]for...
I am a fallen angel, fallen in love[n](Lonely Lucifer)

[msg MSG_006]
......
Is this another one of Marie's poems...?

[msg MSG_007 [Marie]]
...Nngaaaaaaaaaah!

[msg MSG_008 [Marie]]
Wh-Wh-Why...! This can't be happening! I[n]JUST wrote this one...!
And why do you keep reading them!?[n]That's YOUR deadly sin!

[msg MSG_009 [Margaret]]
...That's quite enough. You're going to[n]redden your complexion, Lonely Lucifer.

[msg MSG_010 [Marie]]
B-But...!
You know about... Lonely... Lucifer?
......
Whatever,[n]stupidIhateyouyou'reLucifersothere! Why[n]don't you try falling in love!

[msg MSG_011]
Marie is blushing madly...

[msg MSG_012 [Marie]]
Please... don't eavesdrop on my pathos[n]anymore...

[msg MSG_013 [Marie]]
...! N-Nothing!

[msg MSG_014]
Marie returned to her usual spot. She[n]looked noticeably unsettled...

[msg MSG_015 [Justine]]
...Do you have a moment, Inmate?

[msg MSG_016 [Caroline]]
You know Marie's poems? ...Well... we[n]saw something...

[sel SEL_017 top]
Saw what?
Why are you whispering?

[msg MSG_018 [Caroline]]
Look, just listen!

[msg MSG_019 [Caroline]]
The one who's always leaving the poems[n]on the floor... is...

[msg MSG_020 [Margaret]]
Oh, what's this? A little secret[n]meeting?

[msg MSG_021 [Caroline]]
Eep!

[msg MSG_022 [Margaret]]
Don't stop on my account. By all means,[n]continue.

[msg MSG_023 [Caroline]]
Uh... no, it's nothing. Nothing at all.
Right, Justine?

[msg MSG_024 [Justine]]
Y-Yes...

[msg MSG_025 [Caroline]]
Forget it all, Inmate! Got it!?

[msg MSG_026]
Caroline and Justine have left in a[n]panic.

[msg MSG_027 [Margaret]]
*chuckle* What an adorable pair. Please,[n]do what you can to keep indulging them.
