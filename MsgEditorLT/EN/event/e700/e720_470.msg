Hey, where are you going? We need to go[n]get some meat from the freezer[n]container.

[msg MSG_001 [Chie]]
Yeah, we better get over there! It'd be[n]just awful if someone swiped it before[n]we could!

[msg MSG_002 [Yosuke]]
Uh, you're probably the only one in this[n]whole movie who's that obsessed with[n]meat...

[msg MSG_003 [Yusuke]]
When will we be able to sample this meat[n]we speak of? My stomach won't stop[n]growling.

[msg MSG_004 [Yosuke]]
I guess we've got TWO meat freaks now...

[msg MSG_005 [Akechi]]
Looks like we shouldn't get sidetracked―[n]let's head straight to that freezer[n]container.

[msg MSG_006 [Akechi]]
Why don't we avoid getting sidetracked[n]and just head straight to the freezer[n]container?

[msg MSG_007 [P4 Hero]]
Hold on. Let's take this opportunity to[n]look for a place to cook the meat.

[msg MSG_008 [Morgana]]
Yeah, we need a spot with a water source[n]nearby for cooking. Lead the way, Joker!

[msg MSG_009 [Morgana]]
Hey, that's not the way. We're looking[n]for a spot with a water source nearby[n]for cooking.
