Whoooa! I'm really in a sci-fi world!
Seeing this stuff with my own two eyes[n]is such a huge difference! Oh man, this[n]is as real as it gets!

Simmer down.
I get what you mean.

[msg MSG_002 [Yusuke]]
He's right, Oracle. Why don't you just[n]relax a bit?

[msg MSG_003 [Futaba]]
Hrgh... You're the last person I wanna[n]hear that from, Inari!

[msg MSG_004 [Futaba]]
Right!? Experiencing something like this[n]is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! No,[n]even rarer than that!
I can't wait to see all the technology[n]of this world!

[msg MSG_005 [Yusuke]]
Oracle, you're getting too worked up.[n]Why don't you just relax a bit?

[msg MSG_006 [Futaba]]
Hrgh... You're the last person I wanna[n]hear that from, Inari!

[msg MSG_007 [Futaba]]
Okay! Time to buckle down and begin our[n]exploration!
You're probably more than aware already,[n]butâ€•I can't fight.
And don't you forget it!

[msg MSG_008 [Yusuke]]
Well, this is just as dangerous as our[n]usual work as Phantom Thieves. Don't[n]stray too far from the group, Oracle.

[msg MSG_009 [Futaba]]
Aye aye, Cap'n!
