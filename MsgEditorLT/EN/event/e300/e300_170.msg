[msg MSG_000 [Morgana]]
That sound... Is this gonna be another[n]Overseer announcement?

[msg MSG_001 [Shinjiro]]
Ugh, what's his deal now?

[msg MSG_002 [Overseer]]
Malfunctioning unit UIY-2249 has[n]circumvented standard formatting[n]procedure and is evading capture...
Dispose of it immediately upon[n]discovery. The same fate awaits any unit[n]who does not share our dispose-sition!

[msg MSG_003 [Yosuke]]
This guy keeps dropping the lamest jokes[n]in his speeches...

[msg MSG_004 [Robot with a ribbon]]
WE ARE ALL PROGRAMMED TO LAUGH AT THEM.

[msg MSG_005 [Ryuji]]
Oh, that really sucks―wait, aren't you[n]supposed to be laughin' it up and[n]disposin' us too, then?

[msg MSG_006 [Robot with a ribbon]]
MY CIRCUITS HAVE BLOCKED HIS ORDERS.
ALSO, I WAS NEVER PROVIDED WITH ANY[n]COMBAT FUNCTIONS, SO I AM INCAPABLE OF[n]ATTACKING ANYONE.

[msg MSG_007 [Ken]]
By the way, he said something about[n]UIY-whatever... What was that?

[msg MSG_008 [Robot with a ribbon]]
UIY-2249. THIS IS MY UNIT IDENTIFICATION[n]NUMBER.

[msg MSG_009 [Yusuke]]
So, it's the same as what was assigned[n]to us―TK-something, and YS-something.

[msg MSG_010 [UIY-2249]]
THE SYSTEM MANAGES EACH UNIT THROUGH THE[n]COMBINATION OF MODEL TYPE AND ID NUMBER.
NO TWO UNITS CAN BE ASSIGNED THE SAME[n]UNIT IDENTIFICATION NUMBER.

[msg MSG_011 [Naoto]]
Numeric identification, eh? That would[n]certainly help to oppress individuality[n]within a society.

[msg MSG_012 [Chie]]
So, does that mean you don't have a name[n]besides the UIY-thingy?

[msg MSG_013 [UIY-2249]]
I DO NOT.

[msg MSG_014 [Yukiko]]
Aww... Why don't we give her a name,[n]then? Calling her an ID number seems[n]somewhat rude―and boring.

[msg MSG_015 [Haru]]
Yeah, great idea! Do you have any[n]suggestions, Joker?

[sel SEL_016 top]
Robogirl.
Aigis Jr.
Becky.

[msg MSG_017 [Kanji]]
Uh, I guess that's pretty easy to get,[n]but, ehhh...

[msg MSG_018 [Chie]]
Let's see, what would sound cuter? We[n]could use Robomi, Roboe, Roboko...[n]Robomaru?

[msg MSG_019 [Makoto]]
Shouldn't we try to stay away from the[n]word "robot"? I mean, you wouldn't name[n]a person "Human"...

[msg MSG_020 [Yukiko]]
Then, how about some princess names...[n]Like Oichi, Komatsu-hime, or... Ooh, how[n]about Nene?

[msg MSG_021 [Shinjiro]]
Those are all so random. And why're you[n]going straight to the Sengoku Period for[n]princess names?

[msg MSG_022 [Junpei]]
Shouldn't we come up with a stronger[n]name to scare away the robots? Like[n]Aigis Z, or somethin'.
Hmm... Is that really strong enough?

[msg MSG_023 [Ken]]
Then how about... Grand Aigis Zeta[n]Unleashed!

[msg MSG_024 [Junpei]]
Ah, perfect! Someone with a name like[n]that would have a totally insane[n]ultimate attack.

[msg MSG_025 [Yukari]]
No. Also, why are you choosing macho-[n]sounding robot names when she's clearly[n]a girl?

[msg MSG_026 [Morgana]]
Dude, what...!?

[msg MSG_027 [Mitsuru]]
Becky? Is there some origin to that[n]name?

[msg MSG_028 [Morgana]]
N-No no no! Nope! No, let's just... not[n]use that name!

[msg MSG_029 [Ann]]
Let's make it sound cuter, too. Oh, how[n]about Pudding?

[msg MSG_030 [Yusuke]]
I prefer Almond Jelly over Pudding. It's[n]also a white dessert, which is much more[n]fitting.

[msg MSG_031 [Yosuke]]
I don't mean to shut down the convo[n]here, but can't we just agree on a[n]single regular, fitting name!?

[msg MSG_032 [Futaba]]
...Ribbon. How about Ribbon?

[sel SEL_033 top]
I'm a fan.
It's nice and easy to understand.
We should be asking her.

[msg MSG_034 [Futaba]]
For real?

[msg MSG_035 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Ribbon-chan, huh? Sounds pretty! What do[n]you think about it?

[msg MSG_036 [Makoto]]
I agree. It's easy to remember, too...
But what matters most is if she likes it[n]herself. So, what do you think about[n]Ribbon?

[msg MSG_037 [P3 Fem Protag]]
You're right. So, how do you feel about[n]the name Ribbon, then?

[msg MSG_038 [UIY-2249]]
RIBBON... THERE ARE NO ISSUES. I LIKE[n]IT.

[msg MSG_039 [Futaba]]
Yes! You really like it!?

[msg MSG_040 [Mitsuru]]
If she finds the name agreeable, then[n]it's decided. From here on out, you are[n]now "Ribbon."

[msg MSG_041 [UIY-2249]]
I AM... RIBBON?

[msg MSG_042 [Futaba]]
Yeah, Ribbon! That name's in a way[n]higher tier than some lame code is,[n]right?

[msg MSG_043 [Ribbon]]
YES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

[msg MSG_044 [Futaba]]
We'll never let them dispose of you,[n]alright, Ribbon? Just come with us!

[msg MSG_045 [Akechi]]
But for her to truly be safe in this[n]movie, we probably need to do something[n]about that Overseer...
In any case, let's head to the lab next.

[msg MSG_046 [P3 Fem Protag]]
You're right. Let's pick up the pace!
