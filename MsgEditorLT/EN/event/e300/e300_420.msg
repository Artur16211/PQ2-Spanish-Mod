[msg MSG_001 [P3 Fem Protag]]
...Aigis? What is it? Is there something[n]on my face?

[msg MSG_002 [Junpei]]
What's the deal, Ai-chan?
You're gazing at [f 6 1 27 0 0 0] so intensely[n]that it's starting to make me feel a[n]little jealous!

[msg MSG_003 [Aigis]]
Everyone else mentioned it earlier, but[n]I too am curious about the topic.
I met [f 6 1 27 0 0 0]-san only a short time[n]ago...
However, I sense something that draws me[n]towards her.

[msg MSG_004 [Yukiko]]
Could that be the same sensation that we[n]were talking about?
Or, don't tell me―can you see something[n]only visible to your robotic eyes?

[msg MSG_005 [Chie]]
S-Stop it! Do you mean she can... see[n]spirits?

[msg MSG_006 [Aigis]]
I have no capabilities for detecting[n]supernatural phenomena. Are you[n]referring to some other function?

[msg MSG_007 [Futaba]]
Ooh, I'm curious too. What other special[n]functions are loaded on you?

[sel SEL_008 top]
She can perform EKG scans.
She can generate X-rays.
She can see people's auras.

[msg MSG_009 [Yukiko]]
Ooh, yes―that! I bet she can shoot[n]X-rays from her eyes and analyze our[n]organs with electricity!

[msg MSG_010 [Naoto]]
U-Um... Is that really true?

[msg MSG_011 [Aigis]]
Unfortunately, no.

[msg MSG_012 [Naoto]]
That's what I had figured...

[msg MSG_013 [Chie]]
You can see WHAT!? What's my aura look[n]like?

[msg MSG_014 [Yosuke]]
I bet it's medium-rare, Chie...

[msg MSG_015 [Chie]]
I prefer my meat to be cooked rare, so[n]I'd be happier if my aura was more red[n]than pink, thank you very much.

[msg MSG_016 [Yosuke]]
I was being sarcastic! I mean, I highly[n]doubt she's got any psychic functions.

[msg MSG_017 [Aigis]]
I am uncertain if it could properly be[n]called a function, but...

[msg MSG_018 [Yosuke]]
Wait―you do!?

[msg MSG_019 [Mitsuru]]
She must mean that she's able to sense[n]matters that are more spiritual, rather[n]than seeing them with her eyes.

[msg MSG_020 [Yukari]]
So, something like... her heart?

[msg MSG_021 [Aigis]]
Yes... I feel that is an appropriate[n]analog.

[msg MSG_025 [P3 Fem Protag]]
......

[msg MSG_026 [Aigis]]
...[f 6 1 27 0 0 0]-san is also most important to[n]me.

[msg MSG_027 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Huh!?

[msg MSG_028 [Aigis]]
Along with [f 6 1 16 0 0]-san, I will protect[n][f 6 1 27 0 0 0]-san as well.

[msg MSG_029 [P3 Fem Protag]]
...Thank you. Hearing that from you[n]makes me feel reassured.

[msg MSG_033 [Junpei]]
Well, now that we're all simpatico[n]again, let's continue knockin' it out of[n]the park!

[msg MSG_034 [Koromaru]]
Arf!
