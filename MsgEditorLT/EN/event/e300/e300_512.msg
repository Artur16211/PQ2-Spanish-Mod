Hm?
This door seems to be locked. I doubt we[n]can pass through here...
If we found a key for it, though...[n]Let's search for an alternate route for[n]now.

[msg MSG_001 [Fuuka]]
This door seems to be locked. We won't[n]be able to use it unless we have a[n]key...
Sorry about that... Let's look for[n]another route.

[msg MSG_002 [Fuuka]]
This is locked, right? Maybe if we use[n]that key from earlier...

[msg MSG_003 [Akihiko]]
Right, let's get that key card out.

[msg MSG_004 [Mechanical voice]]
AUTHORIZATION COMPLETE. DOOR UNLOCKED.

[msg MSG_005 [Fuuka]]
Oh, we did it! Now we can keep going.
But, please be careful.
If this sector is behind this level of[n]security, the inside should be even[n]worse... Don't let your guard down!

[msg MSG_006 [Fuuka]]
Hm?
This door seems to be locked. We won't[n]be able to use it unless we have a[n]key...

[msg MSG_007 [Akihiko]]
A key, huh?
Oh, should we try that key card that we[n]lifted off the Overseer earlier?

[msg MSG_008 [Mitsuru]]
Yes, let's give it a try.

[msg MSG_009 [Mechanical voice]]
AUTHORIZATION COMPLETE. DOOR UNLOCKED.

[msg MSG_010 [Fuuka]]
Oh, we did it! Now we can keep going.
But, please be careful.
If this sector is behind this level of[n]security, the inside should be even[n]worse... Don't let your guard down!
