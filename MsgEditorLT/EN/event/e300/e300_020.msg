......!

[msg MSG_001 [Yusuke]]
Ah... Quite a different atmosphere from[n]the previous film.

[msg MSG_002 [Naoto]]
This one seems to be a sci-fi movie―but,[n]that trailer left a rather bad[n]aftertaste.

[msg MSG_003 [Kanji]]
Bein' different's evil, huh? What[n]bullshit!

[msg MSG_004 [Futaba]]
So, individuality is inexcusable...

[sel SEL_005 top]
What's wrong?
What's up, Futaba?

[msg MSG_006 [Futaba]]
O-Oh, it's nothing...

[msg MSG_007 [Hikari]]
......

[msg MSG_008 [Nagi]]
Say, Hikari-san: what are your feelings[n]on this movie so far?

[msg MSG_009 [Hikari]]
That robot's being treated so badly...[n]all for being different... Even being[n]called "evil"...
If it just tried to be the same as[n]everyone else... couldn't it avoid all[n]that trouble?

[msg MSG_010 [Futaba]]
Huh!? Do you really think that, Hikari?

[msg MSG_011 [Teddie]]
Ohhh nooo... Everybody has to be the[n]same...
Then, why do I exist as Teddie instead?

[msg MSG_012 [P4 Hero]]
Teddie...

[msg MSG_013 [Teddie]]
Sensei and Yosuke and everybody else are[n]all different, and I like each of them[n]for who they are...
So it just... makes me so sad that they[n]all should be the same instead![n]Waaaaah...

[msg MSG_014 [Yosuke]]
He's got the right idea! Teddie is[n]Teddie, and I'm me―just like it should[n]be.

[msg MSG_015 [Hikari]]
I, ah...
It'd just be better if I didn't stick[n]out... I need to act normal and blend in[n]with society...
That's what I always thought... until[n]now.

[msg MSG_016 [Futaba]]
...And now?

[msg MSG_017 [Hikari]]
Watching all of you in those movies... I[n]started to feel like I might have been[n]wrong...
But, I'm not sure. I can't tell[n]anymore...

[msg MSG_018 [Futaba]]
Ah, I see...

[msg MSG_019 [Chie]]
Aaaaalright! Let's get up in that movie!
The sooner we change it, the sooner[n]we're outta here! It's time to revise[n]this crappy plot!

[msg MSG_020 [Ryuji]]
Right! And, if we do that, Hikari may[n]not feel so confused about her feelings[n]either.

[msg MSG_021 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hang on, everyone! There's something you[n]should hear before we jump into the[n]movie...
The main robot in that trailer was[n]familiar to me―the same goes for the[n]title, too.

[msg MSG_022 [P4 Hero]]
What do you mean?

[msg MSG_023 [P3 Fem Protag]]
That robot with the ribbon looked like a[n]friend of mine... Her name is Aigis.

[sel SEL_024 top]
Isn't that also the movie's title?
You're friends with a robot?

[msg MSG_025 [Haru]]
The movie trailer pronounced the title[n]as "A-I-gis," but you pronounced it as[n]"AI-gis"?
So, the "AI" part stands for artificial[n]intelligence, but the "GIS" part...

[msg MSG_026 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Mmhm, and my friend's name is spelled[n]the exact same way. I can't imagine[n]that's mere coincidence.

[msg MSG_027 [Teddie]]
Never mind that―you're friends with a[n]robot!? I can bearly believe it...

[msg MSG_028 [Morgana]]
Yeah, this is really taking a turn for[n]the strange.

[msg MSG_029 [Yosuke]]
Did you two actually just say that?

[msg MSG_030 [Teddie]]
You're friends with a robot!? I can[n]bearly believe it...

[msg MSG_031 [Morgana]]
Yeah, this is really taking a turn for[n]the strange.

[msg MSG_032 [Yosuke]]
Did you two actually just say that?

[msg MSG_033 [Haru]]
The movie trailer pronounced the title[n]as "A-I-gis," but you pronounced it as[n]"AI-gis"?
So, the "AI" part stands for artificial[n]intelligence, but the "GIS" part...

[msg MSG_034 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Mmhm, and my friend's name is spelled[n]the exact same way. I can't imagine[n]that's mere coincidence.

[msg MSG_035 [P3 Fem Protag]]
It's true that Aigis is a robot, but we[n]don't think of her any differently than[n]we do the rest of our friends.
She has her own identity, and her own[n]opinions, too. We treat her like our[n]companion, not just a robot.

[msg MSG_036 [Hikari]]
A companion... with an identity...

[msg MSG_037 [Akechi]]
So, what we've determined thus far is,[n]someone we know has been cast into this[n]movie as well.

[msg MSG_038 [Naoto]]
Indeed. First, Kamoshidaman's world;[n]then, Yosukesaurus' world.
It only makes sense that the same would[n]occur with this third movie, too.

[msg MSG_039 [Ann]]
Well, maybe third time's the charm[n]and-chan's companions are in this one,[n]right?

[msg MSG_040 [P3 Fem Protag]]
You think so too!? Then, let's hurry up[n]and find them!

[msg MSG_041 [Nagi]]
So, you're determined to edit the movie[n]once more...
If you sense that you are in any danger,[n]please return here immediately.

[msg MSG_042 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Of course! We'll be on our way now!

[msg MSG_043 [Elizabeth]]
...Theo. Your guest wishes to reconvene[n]with her companions most earnestly.
During times such as these―*munch munch*[n]What do you believe would be the best[n]course to take?

[msg MSG_044 [Theodore]]
We'll just have to watch over her.[n]That's all we can do...

[msg MSG_045 [Elizabeth]]
Then―*munch munch* Let us focus on[n]observing them closely, with popcorn in[n]hand... *munch munch*

[msg MSG_046 [Theodore]]
Sister... Could you please focus on[n]either eating or talking, and not doing[n]both at the same time?

[msg MSG_047 [Hikari]]
Everyone... Please come back safe...
