[msg MSG_000 [Makoto]]
Well, at least we took care of that lock[n]without any issues...

[msg MSG_001 [Morgana]]
We're down to the last lock...
Now's not the time to think about that,[n]though.

[msg MSG_002 [Futaba]]
That's right! We need to hurry and find[n]Hikari!

[msg MSG_003 [Yusuke]]
That buzzer...

[msg MSG_004 [Theater intercom]]
We have an announcement for our[n]customers.
A new movie will begin showing in[n]Theater 4 momentarily. I repeat...

[msg MSG_005 [Theater intercom]]
A new movie... will begin... showing[n]in... Theater 4...
Please... come see the movie... no[n]matter what...

[msg MSG_006 [Makoto]]
Wait, wasn't that last line...?

[sel SEL_007 top]
It's from that invitation letter.
I can't recall where it's from...

[msg MSG_008 [Akechi]]
...I see.
It was the same request as the one[n]written on that invitation letter[n]Hikari-san discovered.

[msg MSG_009 [Yusuke]]
That's right... What's going on here?

[msg MSG_010 [Ann]]
Hikari, please be safe...

[msg MSG_011 [Ryuji]]
Arrrgh! There's no point runnin' our[n]mouths here!
That thing said Theater 4, right? Let's[n]get in there and save Hikari!

[msg MSG_012 [Rise]]
Hey, another theater door's opened up!

[msg MSG_013 [P3 Hero]]
That announcement just now... It means[n]another movie's started playing, right?

[msg MSG_014 [Ann]]
Wait! What about Hikari!?

[msg MSG_015 [Fuuka]]
We couldn't find her anywhere, though...[n]I'm not even sure she's still here in[n]the theater.

[msg MSG_016 [P4 Hero]]
Same hereâ€•we couldn't find her either.[n]That means, the only place left is...

[msg MSG_017 [P3 Fem Protag]]
...Inside the movie.

[msg MSG_018 [Kanji]]
Heh, I had a feelin' we were gonna get[n]in there. We're ready to go whenever.

[msg MSG_019 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_020 [Morgana]]
Let's go, everyone! No one better let[n]their guards down!
