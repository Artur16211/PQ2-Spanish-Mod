In a world not unlike our own...

[msg MSG_000_1]
Mankind engaged in conflict after[n]conflict until driving the entire[n]species to extinction.

[msg MSG_001]
When the dust settled, the planet[n]eventually developed into a peaceful[n]utopia...

[msg MSG_001_1]
...populated solely by robots under the[n]command of an almighty AI.

[msg MSG_002]
This is awesome!

[msg MSG_003]
So we've got a sci-fi movie this time...

[msg MSG_004]
An optimal society requires uniformity.

[msg MSG_004_1]
Defiance of uniformity is nothing more[n]than a malfunction. Individuality is[n]irregularity.

[msg MSG_004_2]
Any unit who acquires this error is to[n]be deemed a "t-error"!

[msg MSG_005]
But one day, in this artificial,[n]standardized paradise...

[msg MSG_006]
......!

[msg MSG_007]
...a lone robot discovers a sense of[n]self.

[msg MSG_008]
A great evil that dares to voice[n]opinions and disrupt proper order has[n]awoken!

[msg MSG_009]
The entire world's peace and harmonyâ€•[n]jeopardized by a single robot!

[msg MSG_010]
Can this defective unit cast out the[n]evil within and delete its individuality[n]before it's too late?

[msg MSG_011]
The answer will move you to tears...

[msg MSG_012]
