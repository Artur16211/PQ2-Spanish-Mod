[msg MSG_000 [Ryuji]]
Huh? There's somethin' here on the[n]ground.

[msg MSG_001 [Naoto]]
Is that... a gun?

[sel SEL_002 top]
Is it real?
I've seen something like that.

[msg MSG_003 [Makoto]]
Even if it weren't, why is it in this[n]movie, of all places?

[msg MSG_004 [Yusuke]]
Yes, I feel as if I've seen something[n]exactly like it as well...

[msg MSG_005 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hang on! That's an Evoker!

[msg MSG_006 [Ryuji]]
You mean that thing you use when[n]summoning Personas?

[msg MSG_007 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Yeah―see how it has "SEES" engraved on[n]it?
Mine's right here with me, so this one[n]could be my companion's!

[msg MSG_008 [Ann]]
Wait, does that mean your friends really[n]are in this movie!?

[msg MSG_009 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Most likely. I can't tell whose Evoker[n]this is, though...

[msg MSG_010 [Yosuke]]
Well, if this is used for summoning[n]Personas, isn't it bad that they don't[n]have this?

[msg MSG_011 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Maybe they lost it after getting[n]attacked. I hope everyone's okay...

[msg MSG_012 [Chie]]
Don't look so down! Remember how our[n]Yosuke turned out to be okay?
We'll definitely find your companions[n]too, [f 6 1 27 0 0 0]-chan!

[sel SEL_013 top]
Of course.
No worries there.

[msg MSG_014 [Morgana]]
We're all on your side here, so feel[n]free to rely on us.

[msg MSG_015 [Yosuke]]
Not just the Phantom Thieves, either―[n]the whole Investigation Team's got your[n]back, too.

[msg MSG_016 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Aw, you guys...
Thank you so much! And you're right,[n]we've gotta keep moving for now!

[msg MSG_017 [P4 Hero]]
I'm sure your companions are looking for[n]you as well. Let's get you reunited with[n]them.
