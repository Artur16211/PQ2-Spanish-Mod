Oracle! How is she!?

[msg MSG_001 [Futaba]]
Sh-She's... still not moving... Her[n]lights are out, too...

[msg MSG_002 [Haru]]
No... She tried to save us, even if it[n]meant sacrificing herself...

[msg MSG_003 [Yukiko]]
Ribbon-chan was completely different[n]from when we first met her―she changed[n]so much...

[msg MSG_004 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Yeah... She didn't just do what she was[n]ordered. She thought for herself, and[n]acted on her own desires...
She finally gained an identity... It[n]can't end like this!

[msg MSG_005 [Shinjiro]]
Tch... Isn't there anything we can do!?

[sel SEL_006 top]
We have to at least try.
But what, exactly?

[msg MSG_007 [Futaba]]
Yes... I refuse to let this happen to[n]her!

[msg MSG_008 [Fuuka]]
Aigis, could you take a look, too? Your[n]design configurations are similar, so[n]maybe...

[msg MSG_009 [Aigis]]
Understood. I will give it my all.

[msg MSG_010 [Fuuka]]
Aigis, could you take a look, too? Your[n]design configurations are similar, so[n]maybe...

[msg MSG_011 [Aigis]]
Roger that. I will give it my all.

[msg MSG_012 [Futaba]]
Thank you!
Hang in there, Ribbon... You're going to[n]be just fine!

[msg MSG_013 [Kanji]]
Oracle... I didn't know she cared so[n]much...

[msg MSG_014 [Yusuke]]
She's been through a lot.

[msg MSG_015 [Makoto]]
Yes―she stood out from the crowd because[n]of all the things she could do that[n]others couldn't...
I think Ribbon's troubles with her[n]individuality really resonated with[n]Oracle.

[msg MSG_016 [Ken]]
Oh, I get it now...
The reason she came along with us into[n]the movie was because she sympathized[n]with Ribbon-san in the trailer...

[msg MSG_017 [Futaba]]
Please wake up, Ribbon!
I'm sure it'll be a great world from[n]here on...
You worked so hard... I'm positive the[n]world will change...
That's why you need to see it for[n]yourself! So just... just wake up!

[msg MSG_018 [Ann]]
Yeah... She's right. I just know it![n]This is going to be a world where[n]everyone can live however they want.
It'll be a wonderful place...

[msg MSG_019 [Aigis]]
Ribbon-san!
