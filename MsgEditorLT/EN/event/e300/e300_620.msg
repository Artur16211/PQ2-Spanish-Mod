The credits? Does that mean... the[n]movie's over?

[msg MSG_001 [Rise]]
Well, that was the case with the[n]others... but... this ending was...

[msg MSG_002 [Nagi]]
Hikari-san... What did you think of the[n]movie?

[msg MSG_003 [Hikari]]
I... figured out that I'm just like[n]Ribbon-chan.
I've had to blend in with everyone[n]around me... I believed it was bad to be[n]different.
That's why I thought I had to deny who I[n]really am...

[msg MSG_004 [Nagi]]
Is that so?

[msg MSG_005 [Hikari]]
That's how the robots thought, too...[n]Individuality was only a problem to[n]them.
You're supposed to be the same as[n]everyone else―that's what I kept telling[n]myself.
Ribbon-chan chose to change...

[msg MSG_006 [Hikari]]
But, because she changed, she...
......

[msg MSG_007 [Doe]]
......

[msg MSG_008 [Hikari]]
...Doe.

[msg MSG_009 [Fuuka]]
Eek!? R-Rise-chan! What's that behind[n]you!?

[msg MSG_010 [Rise]]
Oh, right―this is your first time seeing[n]him.
Well, that's Doe... He's the one playing[n]all the weird movies.
He doesn't talk, and we don't get any[n]sort of Shadow reading from him, so it[n]seems like he's not an enemy...

[msg MSG_011 [Nagi]]
Doe is indeed a mystery to us, but...
Just to be safe, it's a good idea to[n]maintain your distance from him so you[n]don't provoke him.

[msg MSG_012 [Fuuka]]
O-Okay... I can do that.

[msg MSG_013 [Doe]]
......

[msg MSG_014 [Rise]]
Hey, look! The movie!

[msg MSG_015 [Fuuka]]
Huh...? Oh!

[msg MSG_016 [Rise]]
It's not really over yet!

[msg MSG_017 [Hikari]]
Huh!?
