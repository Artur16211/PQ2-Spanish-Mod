[msg MSG_000 [Yosuke]]
...Huh? Is this is a dead end?

[msg MSG_001 [Haru]]
You’re right. Should we head back?

[msg MSG_002 [Koromaru]]
Bark! Bark bark!

[msg MSG_003 [Ken]]
What’s wrong, Koromaru?

[msg MSG_004 [Shinjiro]]
Oh, an air duct...
Yeah, this connects to the other side.[n]I’m impressed you spotted this.

[msg MSG_005 [Aigis]]
Koromaru-san says, “We can go through[n]here."

[msg MSG_006 [Akechi]]
I see. There’s no other option, either.

[msg MSG_007 [Yukari]]
What!? You don’t mean...

[msg MSG_008 [Ryuji]]
Welp, time to pop into that air duct―[n]right, Joker?

[sel SEL_009 top]
You know it.
Business as usual for us.

[msg MSG_010 [Yukari]]
Hrgh, I knew it. Well, there’s no use[n]complaining at this point...

[msg MSG_011 [P4 Hero]]
We’ve followed the Phantom Thieves[n]without hesitation―until now...
Although, on second thought, crawling[n]through an air duct is something you[n]normally wouldn’t get to experience.

[msg MSG_012 [Ann]]
Ahaha, sorry... I guess that'll happen[n]when you spend enough time with us.

[msg MSG_013 [Junpei]]
Aw, it doesn’t bother me one bit. This[n]is an invaluable experience for us!

[msg MSG_014 [Akihiko]]
Well, you’re awfully keen on doing this.[n]What’s with the enthusiasm?

[msg MSG_015 [Yukari]]
I bet it’s for some stupid reason―like,[n]it makes him feel like a spy.

[msg MSG_016 [Junpei]]
Hey! It's not stupid...
I just wanna be cool and debonair when[n]I’m hangin' with the Phantom Thieves and[n]the Investigation Team!

[sel SEL_017 top]
Cool?
Debonair?
You want to be what now?

[msg MSG_018 [P3 Hero]]
Um, it seems like he doesn’t see you[n]that way at all...

[msg MSG_019 [Junpei]]
Whaaaaat!?

[msg MSG_020 [Morgana]]
Tsk tsk. If you want to call yourself[n]cool and debonair, you have to be more[n]like me!

[msg MSG_021 [Ryuji]]
Uh, we don’t see you that way either.

[msg MSG_022 [Naoto]]
At any rate―if there's no other route[n]besides this duct, we’ll just have to[n]use it.

[msg MSG_023 [P4 Hero]]
All right, let's do it.

[msg MSG_024 [Yukari]]
Wait, so we’re really doing this? Does[n]it have to be here!?

[msg MSG_025 [Akihiko]]
What is it, Yukari? You scared?

[msg MSG_026 [Yukari]]
Uh, well... My skirt is short, so...[n]Y’know...

[msg MSG_027 [Akihiko]]
I see. Since it’s short, you’re worried[n]about the defensive weakness.
In that case, just leave it to me to[n]protect you from behind.

[msg MSG_028 [Yukari]]
Th-That’s not what I mean! And there’s[n]no way I’m letting you follow me!
Either a girl goes behind me or I'm[n]going in last!

[msg MSG_029 [P3 Hero]]
Okay, now let’s each decide what order[n]we'll go in.

[msg MSG_030 [Ken]]
Um... Joker, you’re used to traveling[n]through ducts, right?
This is my first time doing it―do you[n]have any advice for me?

[sel SEL_031 top]
Don’t be scared.
Close your eyes.
Learn from experience.

[msg MSG_032 [Yusuke]]
That's true. Fear is your enemy.

[msg MSG_033 [Ken]]
I-I see... That’s helpful to know! Thank[n]you!

[msg MSG_034 [Yusuke]]
That’s right. If you find yourself lost[n]in the darkness, just intuit your way[n]with your sixth sense.

[msg MSG_035 [Ann]]
Wait―you close your eyes when you're in[n]the air ducts, Fox?

[msg MSG_036 [Yusuke]]
Ha... Sometimes, yes.

[msg MSG_037 [Ken]]
That’s helpful to know!

[msg MSG_038 [Makoto]]
No, Amada-kun... You should definitely[n]keep your eyes open.

[msg MSG_039 [Ken]]
Ah―that's rather harsh...
But, this must be the way of the Phantom[n]Thieves! I’ll pretend like I'm a phantom[n]thief and try my hardest!

[msg MSG_040 [P4 Hero]]
I have one question first... Teddie, are[n]you going to fit through here with that[n]body?

[msg MSG_041 [Haru]]
Oh, now that you mention it... How have[n]we managed until now?

[msg MSG_042 [Teddie]]
Heheheh... Don’t sell my acrobatic[n]skills so short!

[msg MSG_043 [Yosuke]]
I guess we’ll just sort of... jam him[n]through there?

[msg MSG_044 [Morgana]]
Great! Let’s move out, everyone―follow[n]our lead!
