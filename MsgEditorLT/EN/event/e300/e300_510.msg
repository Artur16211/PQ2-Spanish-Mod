Ribbon-chan... Come on, Ribbon-chan!

[msg MSG_001 [Yosuke]]
What's wrong with her!?

[msg MSG_002 [Rise]]
She's not moving! That attack earlier[n]must have done something to her...

[msg MSG_003 [Fuuka]]
Oracle, can you see if there's anything[n]you can do!?

[msg MSG_004 [Futaba]]
Yeah, I'll take a look!

[msg MSG_005 [Futaba]]
Let's see... This is the back cover, and[n]that's the touch sensor...
...Ooh, is this it!?

[msg MSG_006 [Ribbon]]
I... I...?

[msg MSG_007 [Chie]]
Sh-She's back!

[msg MSG_008 [Futaba]]
Looks like the shock from that attack[n]activated her sleep mode.

[msg MSG_009 [Ribbon]]
REBOOT COMPLETE... INITIATING DIAGNOSTIC[n]SCAN...

[msg MSG_010 [Ribbon]]
MOBILITY, THOUGHT PROCESSING... ALL[n]GREEN. SYSTEM NORMAL.

[msg MSG_011 [Ann]]
Oh, good! I'm glad you're alright,[n]Ribbon-chan!

[msg MSG_012 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Mmhm, I'm so relieved... Really...

[msg MSG_013 [Ribbon]]
-SAN, YOU ARE CRYING. ARE YOU SAD?

[msg MSG_014 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Huh?

[msg MSG_015 [Ribbon]]
ACCORDING TO MY DATA, HUMANS SHED A[n]SUBSTANCE CALLED TEARS WHEN THEY ARE[n]SAD.
THUS, YOU ARE SAD, CORRECT?

[msg MSG_016 [P3 Hero]]
That's complicated. People cry when[n]they're sad, but sometimes when they're[n]happy, too.

[msg MSG_017 [Teddie]]
When my dinner tastes delicious, or when[n]I'm having fun with everyone, that makes[n]me want to cry, too.

[msg MSG_018 [P4 Hero]]
True, we also cry when we feel relieved[n]or especially moved.

[msg MSG_019 [Ribbon]]
YOU CAN BE MOVED TO TEARS BY BEING[n]HAPPY? OR SAD? OR RELIEVED?

[msg MSG_020 [Akechi]]
I guess you could say there are many[n]different emotions that can evoke such a[n]reaction when felt intensely enough.

[msg MSG_021 [Ribbon]]
SO IT CAN BE DIFFERENT EMOTIONS...[n]PERHAPS THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED TO ME[n]EARLIER?

[msg MSG_022 [Naoto]]
To what are you referring?

[msg MSG_023 [Ribbon]]
THE OVERSEER CALLED ME AN ERROR. THIS IS[n]A FACT―I AM, BY DEFINITION,[n]ERRONEOUS―BUT, DESPITE THIS...
HIS STATEMENT ONLY MADE MY THOUGHTS MORE[n]COMPLEX AND MY CHEST GROW HOT. WHAT WAS[n]THAT?

[sel SEL_024 top]
It was rage.
It was frustration.
It was your rebel heart.

[msg MSG_025 [Shinjiro]]
...Right. It's only natural to get[n]pissed off if someone tries to deny your[n]existence as an individual.

[msg MSG_026 [Kanji]]
I get that...
Someone else decidin' all on their own[n]what you're supposed to be? That totally[n]pisses me off too.

[msg MSG_027 [Futaba]]
Yeah. He denied the validity of your[n]existence, Ribbon. Of course that worked[n]you up enough to defy him.

[msg MSG_028 [Ribbon]]
I SEE... EMOTIONS ARE COMPLEX AND[n]DIFFICULT TO FULLY UNDERSTAND.

[msg MSG_029 [Akihiko]]
Well, that's because you've got to[n]experience 'em more to be able to figure[n]'em out.

[msg MSG_030 [P3 Fem Protag]]
But, I'm sure you'll work it out for[n]yourself, Ribbon-chan.

[msg MSG_031 [Ribbon]]
YES. I WISH TO COMPREHEND.

[msg MSG_032 [Overseer]]
Attention, all units on patrol!

[msg MSG_033 [Junpei]]
Wha―The Overseer!?

[msg MSG_034 [Overseer]]
Dangerous abnormalities are currently[n]wreaking havoc within the facility.[n]Increase security measures immediately.
These errors are to be handled in an[n]appropriate manner upon sight.[n]Irregularity must be error-radicated!

[msg MSG_035 [Yosuke]]
What the hell!? I thought we beat him[n]already!
Wait... Don't tell me even that guy's[n]mass-produced!

[msg MSG_036 [Naoto]]
It's possible that a Mother Computer is[n]behind all of this activity.

[msg MSG_037 [Ken]]
A Mother Computer?

[msg MSG_038 [Akechi]]
The master control unit that commands[n]this world. They're fairly standard in[n]sci-fi movies with robotic societies.
That would mean the Overseer we defeated[n]was only a portion of said computer.

[msg MSG_039 [P3 Hero]]
In other words, until we destroy the[n]root cause, this world can't be righted.

[msg MSG_040 [Futaba]]
Yeah. The way things are going, Ribbon[n]and the other robots are just gonna stay[n]oppressed...

[msg MSG_041 [P4 Hero]]
Then there's only one thing for us to do[n]now...
Find the Mother Computer and shut it[n]down. Does that sound like a plan?

[sel SEL_042 top]
I was going to say that.
Let's put an end to this.

[msg MSG_043 [Morgana]]
We're all on the same wavelength here.[n]There's no need to fuss over it!

[msg MSG_044 [Akihiko]]
Right, let's take our fists to the[n]source. No need to hold back.

[msg MSG_045 [Ribbon]]
LET'S DO THIS!

[msg MSG_046 [Junpei]]
Woah! Gettin' fired up too, huh,[n]Ribbon-chan?

[msg MSG_047 [Ribbon]]
YES. MY CHEST FEELS HOT AGAIN.

[msg MSG_048 [Yosuke]]
Heh! But, you don't have any battle[n]functions, right? Just leave the Mother[n]Computer to us.

[msg MSG_049 [Ribbon]]
REGARDING THAT―ORACLE, IF I MAY SPEAK[n]WITH YOU FOR A MOMENT...

[msg MSG_050 [Futaba]]
What up?

[msg MSG_051 [Futaba]]
Wh-Whaaa―!?

[msg MSG_052 [Ribbon]]
YES. I DISCOVERED IT DURING A SELF-[n]DIAGNOSTIC SCAN... WHAT DO YOU THINK?

[msg MSG_053 [Futaba]]
I mean, I can hammer out a quick program[n]rewrite for you, but... Do you really[n]wanna do this, Ribbon?

[msg MSG_054 [Ribbon]]
YES. I'M ASKING THIS OF MY OWN WILL.

[msg MSG_055 [Futaba]]
Alright, Ribbon...

[msg MSG_056 [Yusuke]]
Excuse me, you two―we need to get[n]moving.

[msg MSG_057 [Futaba]]
Ah―H-Hold on a sec!
I wanna do a quick once-over of Ribbon's[n]programming, just to make sure she[n]didn't sustain any real damage.

[msg MSG_058 [Makoto]]
Well then, what say we wait until those[n]two are ready?

[msg MSG_059 [Futaba]]
Sorry, I'll make it super-fast. Just[n]gimme a sec!

[msg MSG_060 [Ribbon]]
ORACLE... I ENTRUST MYSELF TO YOU.

[msg MSG_061 [Mitsuru]]
You know, we obtained a key card from[n]the Overseer―where do you suppose it's[n]used?

[msg MSG_062 [Akihiko]]
We came across a locked door earlier.[n]Maybe we can use it there?

[msg MSG_063 [Mitsuru]]
That's quite possible. If we can unlock[n]that door, we may be able to proceed[n]onward.

[msg MSG_064 [Akihiko]]
I don't know, but we should probably[n]look for a place where we can try it.

[msg MSG_065 [Mitsuru]]
You're right. That could very well open[n]up a new path for us.

[msg MSG_066 [Futaba]]
And there... we... go!

[msg MSG_066_5 [Futaba]]
Sorry for the wait, folks. We can scoot[n]whenever now!
