[msg MSG_000 [Yukari]]
There's no sign of Aigis or our[n]leader... Where could they have gone?

[msg MSG_001 [Akihiko]]
Same goes for the robot that looks like[n]Aigis―and she's supposed to be the key[n]to changing this movie...

[msg MSG_002 [Ryuji]]
You guys had been searchin' all over[n]here when we ran into you, yeah?

[msg MSG_003 [Mitsuru]]
That's correct. However, our findings[n]were extremely limited...
There were mechanisms and obstacles[n]everywhere―we had reached our wits' end[n]by the time we met you.

[sel SEL_004 top]
Well, let's just keep moving.
Let's be careful going forward.
That's a real pain...

[msg MSG_005 [Akechi]]
If they were at their wits end, then we[n]ought to think things through here,[n]rather than blindly charge ahead.

[msg MSG_006 [Akechi]]
Now that's our leader. Caution is[n]crucial to being a detective as well.

[msg MSG_007 [Yusuke]]
If only we could get some useful[n]information from somebody...

[msg MSG_008 [Mitsuru]]
But, who? We've only met robots so far[n]in this movie.

[msg MSG_009 [Morgana]]
Lemme just make this crystal-clear: no[n]seeking intel from the large, dog-shaped[n]robots. Got it?
It'd be best to find an unarmed intel[n]source, so they won't attack us.

[msg MSG_010 [Makoto]]
Hmm... Where could we find a robot to[n]speak with?

[msg MSG_011 [Koromaru]]
Arf! Arf arf!

[msg MSG_012 [Shinjiro]]
Hm? What're you barkin' at?

[msg MSG_013 [Robot]]
......

[msg MSG_014 [Ken]]
Oh, look over there! It's a weak-looking[n]robot, all by itself!

[msg MSG_015 [Makoto]]
Oh, you're right. I'll attempt to[n]question it.

[msg MSG_016 [Ryuji]]
Queen... Are you sure? Won't it just get[n]all suspicious right away, like with[n]that cop from before―

[msg MSG_017 [Makoto]]
I-I'll do better this time!

[msg MSG_018 [Naoto]]
Well then, please be careful. We'll be[n]watching from here.

[msg MSG_019 [Patrol Robot]]
......

[msg MSG_020 [Makoto]]
Ah, excuse me... There's something I'd[n]like to ask you―

[msg MSG_021 [Patrol Robot]]
BREAK IS AT 1500.

[msg MSG_022 [Makoto]]
Huh?

[msg MSG_023 [Patrol Robot]]
TODAY'S PRODUCTION RATE IS CURRENTLY[n]80%. 2% DECREASE FROM YESTERDAY'S[n]AVERAGE―

[msg MSG_024 [Makoto]]
Um, that's not what I wanted to ask[n]about―

[msg MSG_025 [Patrol Robot]]
5 CASES OF ERROR CORRECTION. 21 CASES OF[n]SCRAP TREATMENT...

[msg MSG_026 [Makoto]]
It's no good... I can't communicate with[n]it.

[msg MSG_027 [Mitsuru]]
It certainly seems that way. I believe[n]we'd only be wasting time trying to[n]speak to this robot any longer.

[msg MSG_028 [Fuuka]]
This isn't anything like how it went[n]with Aigis...

[msg MSG_029 [Ann]]
Hey, guys! What do you think that is on[n]the LCD screen?

[msg MSG_030 [Naoto]]
It seems to be an order demanding an[n]increase in the robots' production rate.

[msg MSG_031 [Haru]]
Who could that be on there? It says,[n]"Great Overseer"...

[msg MSG_032 [Junpei]]
W-Wait a sec! I feel like I've seen that[n]long hair and pair of glasses before...

[msg MSG_033 [Yukari]]
No matter how you look at it, that's[n]definitely Ikutsuki-san...

[msg MSG_034 [Yukiko]]
Is that someone you know?

[msg MSG_035 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Mmhm. He's the chairman of the board at[n]Gekkoukan High and the club advisor of[n]SEES...
But, why's our chairman the overseer of[n]a robot world in this movie?

[sel SEL_036 top]
Because he's a big robot fan?
Did he enter the movie with you?
He was likely cast into the role.

[msg MSG_037 [Ken]]
Um, Fuuka-san, maybe, but him? I've[n]never heard anything of the sort...

[msg MSG_038 [Makoto]]
Then, it'd make the most sense to[n]consider this another example of the[n]movie's casting.

[msg MSG_039 [Mitsuru]]
No... He wasn't with us before we[n]arrived here.

[msg MSG_040 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I was alone too.

[msg MSG_041 [Makoto]]
Then, it'd make the most sense to[n]consider this another example of the[n]movie's casting.

[msg MSG_042 [Makoto]]
I agree. This seems to be yet another[n]example of the movie's casting.

[msg MSG_043 [Mitsuru]]
Casting, you say?

[msg MSG_044 [Makoto]]
Individuals somehow tied to all of us[n]people in the theater world have[n]appeared as characters in the movies...
Theater 1 was Kamoshidaman, Theater 2[n]was Yosukesaurus...
Take a closer look at his image. Doesn't[n]it look more like something created with[n]CGI, rather than a real person?

[msg MSG_045 [Fuuka]]
Oh, you're right!
And, now that I think about it, the[n]Chairman does wear glasses, but not[n]sunglasses like those.

[msg MSG_046 [Akihiko]]
So you're saying that robot that looks[n]like Aigis, from the trailer―that's part[n]of this "casting" too?

[msg MSG_047 [P4 Hero]]
Most likely. In the movie we had[n]appeared within, Yosuke had been cast as[n]a dinosaur, but with his own head.

[msg MSG_048 [Yosuke]]
It looked less like casting and more[n]like a bizarre collage to me―I really[n]lost it the first time I saw him...

[msg MSG_049 [Ken]]
Well, the Chairman is sort of like a[n]guardian to us...
If you take that into consideration, his[n]casting as the overseer here isn't all[n]that strange.

[msg MSG_050 [Yukari]]
Would this fake Ikutsuki-san know where[n]our leader and Aigis are?

[msg MSG_051 [Akechi]]
They may look similar, but their actual[n]identities are completely different.[n]Don't bank on him being on our side.

[msg MSG_052 [Ryuji]]
Oh yeah... If this guy's the big cheese[n]around here...
Doesn't that mean he's the one givin'[n]these orders to eliminate individuality[n]and all that shit?

[msg MSG_053 [Kanji]]
He'd have to be pretty messed up in the[n]head to do somethin' like that. So, what[n]are we gonna do about it?

[msg MSG_054 [Futaba]]
If he's supervising the robots, there[n]has to be some kind of facility like a[n]security complex or a control center.
Why don't we try looking for a place[n]like that?

[msg MSG_055 [Ann]]
It sounds better to me than just[n]wandering around and getting lost. So,[n]where could that facility be?

[msg MSG_056 [Akechi]]
とみ ろめまるま もれ ぺ ゆぺょぺむまゆまょろ みぺぼもゅもろをデ と'ぽ もゆぺむもょま[n]もろ'れ れよゆま れよるろ よみ ぼまょろるぺゅ めゎほテテテ はよれれもほゅを ろめま[n]もょょまるゆよれろ らぺるろ よみ ろめもれ ぼもろを?

[msg MSG_057 [Morgana]]
Hm... Joker, should we try looking for a[n]facility in the central part of the[n]city?

[sel SEL_058 top]
Sounds like a plan.
Fine by me.

[msg MSG_059 [Teddie]]
Alrighty then! It's time to bear-rel[n]ahead to our next destination!

[msg MSG_060 [Chie]]
Ah―Hey! Teddie! Don't go running off[n]like that!

[msg MSG_061 [Mitsuru]]
......

[msg MSG_062 [Shinjiro]]
...What's up, Mitsuru?

[msg MSG_063 [Mitsuru]]
I was just thinking about [f 6 1 26 0 0 0]...
She even knew about the Chairman... Just[n]who could she be?

[msg MSG_064 [Shinjiro]]
, huh? Well, she doesn't seem to be[n]lyin'...
She is tryin' to act brave, though.[n]Probably out of consideration for us.

[msg MSG_065 [Mitsuru]]
Yes, and I do feel awful about that.[n]However, we haven't an inkling of who[n]she is...
It's only during times like these that[n]I'm envious of Akihiko's impulsiveness.

[msg MSG_066 [Shinjiro]]
Whoa! Are you shittin' me?

[msg MSG_067 [Mitsuru]]
*chuckle* I don't rightly know[n]anymore...

[msg MSG_068 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Um... Is something the matter? If we[n]don't keep moving, we'll get separated[n]from the others.

[msg MSG_069 [Shinjiro]]
Ah, it's nothin'. We're off now.

[msg MSG_070 [Mitsuru]]
Indeed...
