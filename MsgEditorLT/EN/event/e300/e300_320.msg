[msg MSG_000 [Boy with earphones]]
So, this is the theater... I can't[n]believe we were just inside a movie.

[msg MSG_001 [Junpei]]
Right? I finally got to make my silver[n]screen debut!

[msg MSG_002 [Hikari]]
I'm glad they found you in time...

[msg MSG_003 [Boy with earphones]]
You're Hikari-san, right? It's nice to[n]meet you. Everyone's told me about you.

[msg MSG_004 [Hikari]]
They went searching for you, and... I'm[n]relieved that you're okay.

[msg MSG_005 [Boy with earphones]]
Thanks for worrying about me too.

[msg MSG_006 [Hikari]]
Oh, um... Well, everyone else was really[n]worried, so...

[msg MSG_007 [Boy with earphones]]
By the way, someone told me you can't[n]remember how or why you came here...

[msg MSG_008 [Hikari]]
M-Mmhm... When I woke up, I was already[n]here...

[msg MSG_009 [Boy with earphones]]
Don't worry. We'll get out of this place[n]together, for sure.
...Of course, that might sound strange[n]coming from someone who just got here.

[msg MSG_010 [Hikari]]
......

[msg MSG_011 [Boy with earphones]]
So, how's Aigis?

[msg MSG_012 [Fuuka]]
Just as Mitsuru-senpai suspected, she[n]seems to only be temporarily down.

[msg MSG_013 [Morgana]]
Futaba, could you lend a hand there?[n]You're good at techy stuff like that,[n]right?

[msg MSG_014 [Futaba]]
Well, I've got hacking skills, but I'm[n]no mechanic...
But! I'll do what I can―lemme take a[n]gander.

[msg MSG_015 [Nagi]]
In that case, please follow me...

[msg MSG_016 [Yusuke]]
How did it go, Futaba?

[msg MSG_017 [Futaba]]
Omigod... She's made up of all these[n]insane parts with insane tech and, um...[n]Anyway, it's just insane!

[sel SEL_018 top]
Ah, I see...
That didn't mean anything.

[msg MSG_019 [Yukiko]]
I don't understand it at all either, but[n]I do grasp the idea that it's insane.

[msg MSG_020 [Futaba]]
It seems like she has an automatic[n]self-repair function―the broken parts[n]are fixing themselves on their own!
What kind of technology DOES that!? This[n]is nothing less than sci-fi wizardry!

[msg MSG_021 [Mitsuru]]
All of her functions seem to be[n]operating normally. There are no[n]problems for the time being.

[msg MSG_022 [Futaba]]
She's severely drained, but at this[n]rate, she should recover pretty soon.

[msg MSG_023 [Hikari]]
I see... I'm glad she's okay, too...

[msg MSG_024 [Akihiko]]
Sorry to be such a bother, but we're[n]going to have to leave Aigis in their[n]care here until she's recovered.

[msg MSG_025 [P4 Hero]]
At least that's one less concern to[n]worry ourselves with.

[msg MSG_026 [Boy with earphones]]
I really must thank you again for your[n]support, including helping Aigis. I'm[n]extremely grateful.
And, um, you are...?

[msg MSG_027 [Kanji]]
Oh yeah, we haven't introduced ourselves[n]yet! I'm Kanji Tatsumi, a first-year at[n]Yasogami High.

[msg MSG_028 [Boy with earphones]]
First-year!? So you're actually younger[n]than me...

[msg MSG_029 [Chie]]
Um, technically, he might be even[n]younger than you think...

[msg MSG_030 [Boy with earphones]]
What's that mean?

[msg MSG_031 [Akechi]]
We've all originated in different[n]places... and different times.
Not only that, some of us are apparently[n]dealing with even more anomalous[n]experiences...

[msg MSG_032 [P3 Fem Protag]]
......

[msg MSG_033 [Akechi]]
We can spare the details for later...
But, basically, we've come from separate[n]worlds―as hard as that may be to[n]believe.

[msg MSG_034 [Boy with earphones]]
I see... All right, then.

[msg MSG_035 [Ann]]
You're just fine with that!?
Hey, I'm starting to get a feeling from[n]him that reminds me a lot of [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]...

[sel SEL_036 top]
I feel like we'd get along well.
I think you're imagining things.

[msg MSG_037 [Chie]]
Ahh, I getcha. You know, he's pretty[n]similar to our own leader, too.

[msg MSG_038 [Chie]]
Really? You know, he's actually pretty[n]similar to our own leader, too.

[msg MSG_039 [Makoto]]
So, you're Takeba-san and Iori-kun's[n]leader too?

[msg MSG_040 [Boy with earphones]]
Yeah―oh, I haven't told you my name yet,[n]huh? My name is...
