[msg MSG_000 [Rise]]
Yessss! Now THAT'S a happy ending!

[msg MSG_001 [Fuuka]]
I feel like I'm tearing up... How was it[n]for you, Hikari-chan?

[msg MSG_002 [Hikari]]
Mm... That was nice. I think it really[n]was a wonderful ending.

[msg MSG_003 [Rise]]
Right, right? A story's gotta end happy,[n]like that!

[msg MSG_004 [Hikari]]
If you expose who you really are, you[n]might get hurt...
So, if you hide yourself and just copy[n]the others around you, you won't get[n]hurt, and life will be easier.
But, eventually your true self will fade[n]away... and you'll lose sight of what[n]even keeps you alive.

[msg MSG_005 [Fuuka]]
I can understand that, too.
I always lacked any confidence in myself[n]and worried about how people saw me...
But after meeting my current companions,[n]being accepted by them...
And even being needed by them, I[n]eventually came to like who I am.

[msg MSG_006 [Hikari]]
I see... Do you think... I could ever[n]make companions like that too?

[msg MSG_007 [Rise]]
Geez! Why don'tcha just tell us what you[n]really think of us, then!?

[msg MSG_008 [Hikari]]
Huh?

[msg MSG_009 [Fuuka]]
I'm sure every one of us already[n]considers you a companion.

[msg MSG_010 [Hikari]]
But I can't fight or help like everyone[n]else... And, we only just met, so...

[msg MSG_011 [Rise]]
None of that matters.
We're all friends headed for the same[n]goal together, supporting each other...[n]Isn't that enough of a reason?

[msg MSG_012 [Hikari]]
Friends...
I see, thanks...
I want to be able to hold my head up[n]high too. I need to get stronger...

[msg MSG_013 [Doe]]
......

[msg MSG_014 [Rise]]
Oh, here he comes... Is it time for the[n]key!?

[msg MSG_015 [Doe]]
Ngh... Nnnngh!

[msg MSG_016 [Fuuka]]
Wh-Whaaat!? It came out of his eyes!?

[msg MSG_017 [Rise]]
Oh, right―it's your first time seeing[n]this, too.

[msg MSG_018 [Fuuka]]
Someone mentioned it to me earlier, but[n]that was a lot more disturbing than what[n]I'd imagined...
It's okay to pick up that key... right?

[msg MSG_019 [Rise]]
Mmhm, no problems with that so far. It[n]should go to the third lock.

[msg MSG_020 [Fuuka]]
Oh, then we should keep it safe for when[n]everyone returns!

[msg MSG_021 [Rise]]
Could you grab it, Fuuka-chan? I'm going[n]to contact Senpai and the others!

[msg MSG_022 [Fuuka]]
Yes, of course!

[msg MSG_023 [Hikari]]
......

[msg MSG_024 [Doe]]
Hikari...

[msg MSG_025 [Hikari]]
......!

[msg MSG_026 [Doe]]
You cannot... remain part of the[n]audience forever...

[msg MSG_027 [Hikari]]
Ah... I...

[msg MSG_028 [Hikari]]
Nnh―Ahhh!

[msg MSG_029 [Fuuka]]
Huh!?

[msg MSG_030 [Rise]]
Ah!
