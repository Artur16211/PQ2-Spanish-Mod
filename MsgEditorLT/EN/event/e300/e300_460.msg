[msg MSG_000 [Futaba]]
Oooh! There really is a path here! Now[n]we can keep going!

[msg MSG_001 [Haru]]
Whew... We finally made it through.[n]Great job, everyone.

[msg MSG_002 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_003 [Ribbon]]
KOROMARU-SAN... THANK YOU FOR PUSHING ME[n]ALONG.

[msg MSG_004 [Koromaru]]
Arf! Arf!

[msg MSG_005 [Mitsuru]]
Come now, don’t get too playful.[n]Ribbon's unsure how to react.

[msg MSG_006 [Ribbon]]
......

[msg MSG_007 [Mitsuru]]
What’s the matter, Ribbon? Is there[n]something on your mind?

[msg MSG_008 [Ribbon]]
WHEN I LOOK AT KOROMARU-SAN... I FEEL[n]SOMETHING ODD IN MY CHEST. I WONDER―WHAT[n]IS THIS?

[msg MSG_009 [Akihiko]]
Are you not feeling well?

[msg MSG_010 [Ribbon]]
I DON’T KNOW. THE TEMPERATURE IN MY[n]CHEST IS RISING A BIT... AND I FEEL AS[n]IF I AM FLOATING.

[sel SEL_011 top]
Are you getting excited?
Are you dying of cute?
Are you growing more muscular?

[msg MSG_012 [Ann]]
I don’t think that’s exactly right. It’s[n]probably more of a dreamy feeling.
Oh, maybe something like, “D'awww,”[n]would cover it.

[msg MSG_013 [Ribbon]]
"D'AWWW"?

[msg MSG_014 [P3 Fem Protag]]
It’s like a feeling you get when you see[n]something so cute, it makes you happy,[n]or want to care for it... I guess?

[msg MSG_015 [Ribbon]]
DYING... OF CUTE?

[msg MSG_016 [P3 Fem Protag]]
It’s like a feeling you get when you see[n]something so cute, it makes you happy,[n]or want to care for it... I guess?

[msg MSG_017 [Akihiko]]
Wait, she’s a robot―doesn't that mean[n]she doesn't have muscles?

[msg MSG_018 [Shinjiro]]
If even Aki can spot the problem with[n]your logic, it's all over.

[msg MSG_019 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I think what Ribbon-chan is trying to[n]say is a feeling of seeing something[n]cute that makes you happy.

[msg MSG_020 [Yukiko]]
Mmhm, it’s this feeling you get when[n]something is so adorable, you just want[n]to squeeze it tight!

[msg MSG_021 [Ribbon]]
SQUEEZE...?

[msg MSG_022 [Chie]]
Huh? Were we wrong?

[msg MSG_023 [Ribbon]]
NO... I WANT TO SQUEEZE KOROMARU-SAN[n]TIGHT...
BUT... ISN’T AN EMOTION LIKE THIS[n]INCOMPATIBLE WITH A ROBOT?

[msg MSG_024 [Kanji]]
Compatibility ain't got a thing to do[n]with it...
Seein' something cute and having[n]feelings over it is totally normal―it[n]just makes you wanna pet it, is all!

[msg MSG_025 [Ribbon]]
IS THAT SO? THEN, DO YOU WANT TO SQUEEZE[n]HIM TIGHT AS WELL, KANJI-SAN?

[msg MSG_026 [Kanji]]
Huh? Well, of course I wanna squee―

[msg MSG_026_5 [Kanji]]
Wait! I mean―Don't ask me, dammit!!!

[msg MSG_027 [Koromaru]]
Grrrrr...

[msg MSG_028 [Ryuji]]
He’s totally warnin' you...

[msg MSG_029 [Haru]]
Say, Ribbon-chan―I don’t think you have[n]to make a decision about how you feel.

[msg MSG_030 [Yusuke]]
Indeed... Others shouldn’t be the ones[n]to dictate how you ought to feel.
Also, you mentioned that your feelings[n]are unbefitting a robot, but look just[n]how carefree Aigis is.

[msg MSG_031 [Futaba]]
Oof, he's gotcha there.

[msg MSG_032 [Aigis]]
Yes―I am a robot, but I am best friends[n]with Koromaru-san as well.

[msg MSG_033 [Koromaru]]
Woof! Woof!

[msg MSG_034 [Aigis]]
Koromaru-san says, “I’d definitely like[n]for you to pet me.”

[msg MSG_035 [Ribbon]]
KOROMARU-SAN... ARE YOU CERTAIN?

[sel SEL_036 top]
Just be gentle with him.
Go to town on that fluff.

[msg MSG_037 [Ken]]
Koromaru loves it if you scratch under[n]his jaw, close to his neck... Right[n]around here!

[msg MSG_038 [Ribbon]]
I SEE... LIKE THIS?

[msg MSG_039 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_040 [Ribbon]]
"PET ME MORE"...?

[msg MSG_041 [Aigis]]
Koromaru-san is delighted. That must[n]feel pleasant to him.

[msg MSG_042 [Ribbon]]
I’M GLAD TO HEAR THAT...

[msg MSG_043 [Koromaru]]
Arf arf!

[msg MSG_044 [Junpei]]
So, what d'ya think? How’d it feel to[n]pet Koromaru?

[msg MSG_045 [Ribbon]]
HE WAS SOFT... WARM... AND VERY...[n]FLUFFY...
DOGS... SO CUTE...

[msg MSG_046 [Teddie]]
If that’s the case, aren't I fluffy too,[n]Ribbon-chan?
So pet me as well, as much as you want![n]Anywhere would be fine!

[msg MSG_047 [Ribbon]]
MY THOUGHT PROCESS HAS DETERMINED THAT I[n]SHOULD POLITELY DECLINE.

[msg MSG_048 [Teddie]]
H-How cruel... All this fluff―going[n]unloved!

[msg MSG_049 [Chie]]
Uh, you clearly had your motives, no[n]matter what you say.

[msg MSG_050 [Yosuke]]
Okay, time to wrap up Fluffy Pet Cuddle[n]Time. We should get going.

[msg MSG_051 [Ribbon]]
YES, I UNDERSTAND. LET’S GO,[n]KOROMARU-SAN.

[msg MSG_052 [Koromaru]]
Arf!
