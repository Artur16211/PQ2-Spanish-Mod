[msg MSG_000]
Each team pressed a release switch and[n]returned to the rendezvous point...

[msg MSG_001 [Junpei]]
*groan* Oh, my back...
Man... I could not be happier to be done[n]with that. Like, seriously.

[msg MSG_002 [Yukari]]
I never thought they'd make us do a test[n]like that for adaptability... I thought[n]I was gonna die back there.

[msg MSG_003 [Naoto]]
It seems that all three of the tests[n]were merciless. We were on thin ice[n]ourselves at times...
But, I'm relieved that all of the teams[n]managed to complete them safely.

[msg MSG_004 [Akechi]]
Now that all three switches have been[n]pressed, we can finally proceed past the[n]security measures.

[msg MSG_005 [Ribbon]]
......

[msg MSG_006 [Makoto]]
What's the matter, Ribbon?

[msg MSG_007 [Ribbon]]
EVERYONE HAS DIFFERENT ABILITIES, BUT IT[n]SEEMED THAT YOU ALL COMPLEMENTED ONE[n]ANOTHER.
SOME WERE SKILLED, SOME LACKED SKILL...[n]THIS IS NOT UNIFORMITY. DOES THAT NOT[n]BOTHER YOU?

[msg MSG_008 [Yosuke]]
Well, it's just a part of our[n]individuality. That Overseer seems to[n]deny it, though.

[msg MSG_009 [Ribbon]]
INDIVIDUALITY...

[msg MSG_010 [Akihiko]]
Plus, we each had a leader who brought[n]such a scattered bunch together into a[n]working team.

[msg MSG_011 [Mitsuru]]
Indeed. We must thank our three leaders[n]for that mission.

[msg MSG_012 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Eheheh, it just makes me happy that I[n]was able to be useful. Still, this was[n]the result of everyone working together!

[msg MSG_013 [P4 Hero]]
Right―it's thanks to our companions[n]doing their best.

[msg MSG_014 [Mitsuru]]
Ha... You have a point. This is the[n]fruit of everyone's hard work.

[msg MSG_015 [Yusuke]]
I'm still curious, though―how did they[n]create such elaborate facilities for[n]these tests?

[msg MSG_016 [Futaba]]
Oh, about that. They seem to have been[n]holographic simulations.
Basically, it was like virtual reality.[n]All the rooms were actually empty.

[msg MSG_017 [Shinjiro]]
So, that tester device thing didn't even[n]exist?

[msg MSG_018 [Futaba]]
Yep. As you'll see, if I press here...

[msg MSG_019 [Futaba]]
Mweheheh! Now we can get through without[n]being hassled by any more exams!

[msg MSG_020 [Ryuji]]
For real!? That's awesome... But kind of[n]a bummer, too...

[sel SEL_021 top]
I'm right there with you.
So, what was the point of all that?
Should we take the exam again?

[msg MSG_022 [Ryuji]]
Know what I mean? We went through all[n]that―and it was all just a bunch of[n]bullshit!

[msg MSG_023 [Makoto]]
Well, it's hard to accept when all that[n]effort was for nothing but a simulation.
Still, we were able to unlock the door[n]to the lab thanks to those efforts,[n]so...

[msg MSG_024 [Ryuji]]
That's not what I mean! We busted our[n]asses in there, but it was basically[n]just some kinda game, right?
It's like, we got tired over nothin'...[n]Or maybe it's more like, that was all[n]just one big lie!?

[msg MSG_025 [Kanji]]
Still, I'm never doin' one of those[n]again if I can avoid it...

[msg MSG_026 [Fuuka]]
Everyone, we've confirmed that the[n]research facility's security has been[n]lifted―the entrance is open!

[msg MSG_027 [Rise]]
Not only that, it seems like you can[n]come and go through that door freely[n]now.
Then again, it looks like you still have[n]a long way to go, so be careful as you[n]proceed!

[msg MSG_028 [Morgana]]
I see―roger that. Well everyone, let's[n]go!
