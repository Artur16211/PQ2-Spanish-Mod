Mitsuru appears to be lost in thought...

[msg MSG_000 [Mitsuru]]
Say, [f 6 1 26 0 0 0]―about your world...

[msg MSG_001 [Yukari]]
She headed to the restroom.

[msg MSG_002 [Mitsuru]]
Oh, I see... *sigh*

[msg MSG_003 [Akihiko]]
You're lookin' down in the dumps. I[n]mean, I can understand why...

[msg MSG_004 [Junpei]]
If [f 6 1 27 0 0 0]'s telling the truth, then this[n]is all even more like a sci-fi story.
Doesn't it mean there's another me[n]somewhere I don't know anything about?

[msg MSG_005 [Ken]]
I've wondered about that kind of thing[n]before, but... is it really possible?

[msg MSG_006 [Junpei]]
Another me...
Oh man, what if THAT me is a totally[n]studly model and a hit with all the[n]ladies around the world!?

Also, considering the way she talked to[n]you, I doubt you're any different in her[n]world.

[msg MSG_008 [Fuuka]]
Um, there's something I forgot to[n]mention earlier...
When the Phantom Thieves and the[n]Investigation Team came to our rescue in[n]the movie...
For just a moment, Lucia[n]misrecognized-chan as our leader.

[msg MSG_009 [Mitsuru]]
What?

[msg MSG_010 [Junpei]]
Oh, I get it, though. Her personality is[n]different, but she's got, like... a[n]similar vibe, somehow?
She just reminds me of our leader. I[n]can't really explain it.

[msg MSG_011 [Yukari]]

[msg MSG_012 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_013 [Ken]]
Looks like Koromaru agrees with you.

[msg MSG_015 [Mitsuru]]
You're right. At any rate, we need to[n]prioritize rescuing our leader and[n]Aigis.

is watching the Gekkoukan High students[n]from a distance...

[msg MSG_017 [P3 Fem Protag]]
......

[msg MSG_018 [Hikari]]
-san...

[msg MSG_019 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Aah! Oh, you surprised me...
Sorry, I spaced out... Eheheh. So,[n]what's up?

[msg MSG_020 [Ryuji]]
Why don'tcha go join 'em―unless it's too[n]awkward, or something...

[msg MSG_021 [Yosuke]]
I mean, I can totally get why they're so[n]confused...
But when I think about how this is[n]making [f 6 1 27 0 0 0]-chan feel, it's just[n]heartbreaking.

[msg MSG_022 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Ahaha! I'm totally fine, though―stuff[n]like parallel universes is so sci-fi!

[sel SEL_023 top]
Don't push yourself too hard.
We're here for you.

[msg MSG_024 [P3 Fem Protag]]
*giggle* Thanks... You're trying to[n]cheer me up, aren't you?

[msg MSG_025 [Hikari]]
Well, [f 6 1 26 0 0 0]-san, you had been so[n]worried about your companions...

[msg MSG_026 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Thanks―you all really are so nice...
But, even if they don't know about me,[n]they're still precious companions of[n]mine.
That'll never change, and I don't want[n]it to.
That's why I'm planning on doing my best[n]to look for their leader and Aigis!

[msg MSG_027 [Hikari]]
...You're so strong, [f 6 1 26 0 0 0]-san.

[msg MSG_028 [P3 Fem Protag]]
*giggle* You think so? It's probably[n]because I've got everyone here backing[n]me up.
If I were all alone, there's no way I[n]would've made it this far.

[msg MSG_029 [Hikari]]
......!
Yeah, me too... I'm glad I met you[n]all...

[msg MSG_030 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Alrighty then! I'll keep doing my best[n]in there―just you watch!

[msg MSG_031 [Hikari]]
Mmhm!
