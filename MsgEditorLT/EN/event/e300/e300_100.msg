[msg MSG_000 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I see―you guys got here through[n]Tartarus...
I ended up here without even noticing[n]I'd been relocated when I exited the[n]Velvet Room...

[msg MSG_001 [Elizabeth]]
Aaaahem, if I may be so bold to present[n]my thoughts on that matter...

[msg MSG_002 [Haru]]
Ahh! You startled me...

[msg MSG_003 [Elizabeth]]
I can hear them call for me, so play the[n]fanfare! It's the electrifying entrance[n]of Elizabeeeth and Theooo!

[msg MSG_004 [Ryuji]]
She's just as weird and hyper as[n]always...

[msg MSG_005 [Boy with baseball cap]]
Hold the phone! Who's this lovely lady!?

[sel SEL_006 top]
These are our helpful assistants.
We have no clue.

[msg MSG_007 [Elizabeth]]
That is correct. I am Elizabeth, the[n]older sister. And this popcorn man here[n]is...

[msg MSG_008 [Elizabeth]]
Ah, what a delightful joke.

[msg MSG_009 [Theodore]]
I am Theodore, her younger brother.[n]Since it seems that everyone is quite[n]confused...

[msg MSG_010 [Elizabeth]]
We helpful siblings have come to explain[n]the situation in which you have found[n]yourselves.

[msg MSG_011 [Spirited girl]]
Oh, could these people be residents of[n]the Velvet Room?
You know, the place where our leader[n]summons his Personas?

[msg MSG_012 [Well-dressed girl]]
We had been informed about you, but...[n]To think we'd meet like this.
Also, what do you intend to explain,[n]exactly?

[msg MSG_013 [Theodore]]
It's in regards to the relationship[n]between you recent arrivals and.
Though you are both aware of the same[n]places, only one party recognizes the[n]other...

[msg MSG_014 [Elizabeth]]
This is because both sides have come[n]from different worlds―that is our[n]working theory.

[msg MSG_015 [Haru]]
Hm? What do you mean by that?

[msg MSG_016 [Elizabeth]]
I do apologize, but we cannot provide[n]further details.
However, we are certain that the Velvet[n]Room is inseparable from its guests'[n]fates.
Nothing meaningless happens within it.[n]The reason why you have encountered[n]everyone else in this world must be...

[msg MSG_017 [Margaret]]
Yes, it must be inevitable.

[msg MSG_018 [Theodore]]
Margaret!?

[msg MSG_019 [Chie]]
When did you get here!?

[msg MSG_020 [Margaret]]
We believe that there is meaning behind[n]this meeting. In other words, it could[n]be called destiny...

[msg MSG_021 [Elizabeth]]
Yes―just as Theo's journey that led him[n]to wear this dope costume was also[n]destiny...

[msg MSG_022 [Theodore]]
Y-You're the one who made me wear this,[n]Sister!

[msg MSG_023 [Margaret]]
It suits you quite well.
Let's see... It's a big pail of popcorn,[n]so...
......

[msg MSG_024 [Theodore]]
Sister... If you can't think up a pun, I[n]believe there's no need to force one.

[msg MSG_025 [P4 Hero]]
Yeah... Trying to come up with one for[n]popcorn isn't easy.

[msg MSG_026 [Boy with baseball cap]]
What does that matter!?

[msg MSG_027 [Quiet girl]]
Um, excuse me... Would it be all right[n]if we got back to the matter at hand?
If we really do come from different[n]worlds... are there any problems with us[n]meeting like this?

[msg MSG_028 [Elizabeth]]
No, most likely not.

[msg MSG_029 [Quiet girl]]
Thank goodness... That means it'll be[n]all right for us to stick together!

[msg MSG_030 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Really? Are you sure?

[msg MSG_031 [Spirited girl]]
I mean, there's no real reason to say[n]no... Plus, you're in trouble too,[n]right?

[msg MSG_032 [Well-dressed girl]]
In all honesty, we still don't know much[n]about you...
But, considering the situation we're in,[n]it'd be best if we took a cooperative[n]position.

[msg MSG_033 [Boy with baseball cap]]
I'm right there with ya! Even more so[n]since she's such a cutie!

[msg MSG_034 [Aggressive boy]]
I'm starting to get excited just[n]thinking about how strong the enemies in[n]this world might be.

[msg MSG_035 [Boy with beanie]]
Classic input from our resident fight-[n]obsessed, meatheaded idiot...

[msg MSG_036 [Aggressive boy]]
Wha―!? Who're you calling an idiot,[n]Shinji!? You never listen, all you do is[n]just insult me!

[msg MSG_037 [Boy with beanie]]
Like you're one to talk, Aki. You always[n]just snap at what people say like some[n]goddamn scared puppy.

[msg MSG_038 [Well-dressed girl]]
Will you two stop it!? This isn't the[n]time for childish bickering!

[msg MSG_039 [P3 Fem Protag]]
*giggle* You two never change.

[msg MSG_040 [Justine]]
Even still...

[msg MSG_041 [Chie]]
When did you get here!?

[msg MSG_042 [Yukiko]]
Come on, Chie, you already said that―[n]Snrk... Are you even paying attention?[n]Heeheehee...

[msg MSG_043 [Caroline]]
Having so many Persona-users here is[n]quite the sight! Don't you agree,[n]Inmate?

[sel SEL_044 top]
It's definitely reassuring.
It's hard keeping names straight.

[msg MSG_045 [P4 Hero]]
I think so too.

[msg MSG_046 [Teddie]]
I wholeheartedly agree... I'm barely[n]able to memorize all the ladies'[n]names...

[msg MSG_047 [P4 Hero]]
But, it's also reassuring to have so[n]many allies.

[msg MSG_048 [P4 Hero]]
I'm sure we can get through even a[n]situation like this if we all work[n]together.

[msg MSG_049 [Morgana]]
Mm, I agree. The more firepower we've[n]got, the better.

[msg MSG_050 [Ryuji]]
Welp, I don't even remember how many[n]times we've already done this, but I[n]guess we should do the usual intros...

[msg MSG_051 [Futaba]]
Awww, again? Is this some kind of[n]punishment?

[msg MSG_052 [Mitsuru]]
I apologize for not introducing[n]ourselves sooner―my name is Mitsuru[n]Kirijo.

[msg MSG_053 [Akechi]]
Kirijo? Could you be affiliated with the[n]Kirijo Group in some way?

[msg MSG_054 [Boy with baseball cap]]
You got it―not only is she the head[n]honcho of the Kirijo Group, she's a top-[n]level student council president, too!

[msg MSG_055 [Akihiko]]
I'm Akihiko Sanada. I'm the captain of[n]the school boxing club.

[msg MSG_056 [Chie]]
Boxing―captain!? That's so cool!

[msg MSG_057 [Teddie]]
Hrgh... I'm so jealous that he's such a[n]heartthrob! I simply must step up my[n]game!

All YOU do is dump protein powder on[n]everything...

[msg MSG_060 [Akihiko]]
Hey, don't sell protein powder short.[n]There's an endless variety of protein[n]blends for every kind of―

[msg MSG_061 [Shinjiro]]
I'm Shinjiro Aragaki. I guess I'm a[n]third-year... if you wanna get technical[n]about it.
Nice to meet you. Uhh... That's all.

[msg MSG_062 [Yosuke]]
Um... That's it?

[msg MSG_063 [Shinjiro]]
I ain't got anything else to say.

[msg MSG_064 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Shinjiro-senpai may look scary, but he's[n]actually really nice and cares a lot for[n]his companions.
Also, his cooking skills are downright[n]motherly. He even cooks meals for the[n]whole squad sometimes!

[msg MSG_065 [Shinjiro]]
Wha―!? Hey, what're you tellin' em!?

[msg MSG_066 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Oh, um, I'm sorry...
The Shinjiro-senpai I know is like[n]that... Am I wrong here?

[msg MSG_067 [Boy with baseball cap]]
No no, you get an A+ for that answer!
"Motherly" is totally one of[n]Shinjiro-san's defining qualities!

[msg MSG_068 [Shinjiro]]
Junpei, you little―

[msg MSG_069 [Boy with baseball cap]]
A-Anyway! Next up, we have our young man[n]Ken and prime pup Koromaru!

[msg MSG_070 [Ken]]
My name is Ken Amada.
This here is Koroumaru, spelled with the[n]characters for tiger and wolf. We just[n]call him Koromaru, though.
He's an albino Shiba Inu. He may be a[n]dog, but he's still an amazing[n]Persona-user!

[msg MSG_071 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_072 [Ann]]
Awww, how cute! He looks so soft and[n]fluffy!
A doggie with a Persona? Such a good[n]boy!

[msg MSG_073 [Koromaru]]
Arf, arf!

[msg MSG_074 [Morgana]]
Ah―Lady Ann... I'm also a fluffy, soft[n]Persona-user...

[msg MSG_075 [Ryuji]]
Oh, so you can't be a cat, but you're[n]fine with bein' fluffy, huh?

[msg MSG_076 [Yukiko]]
Ken-kun, are you in elementary school?

[msg MSG_077 [Ken]]
Yes, I'm in 5th grade...
I'm still not that tall―but I won't lose[n]to my senpai!
Just like Koromaru, I'm going to do my[n]best! I hope we get along!

[msg MSG_078 [Boy with baseball cap]]
Alrighty then, I'll go next!

[msg MSG_079 [Junpei]]
I'm the second-year superstar of the[n]Specialized Extracurricular Execution[n]Squad! The name: Junpei Iori!
Oh, by the way―my heart is reserved for[n]my love, Chidorita, so keep that in[n]mind, alright, ladies?

[msg MSG_080 [Spirited girl]]
Ugh, barf! No one could care less about[n]that.

[msg MSG_081 [Junpei]]
Aww, I'm so sorry that I can't return[n]your feelings, Yuka-tan!
Speaking of Yuka-tan―you're up next.

[msg MSG_082 [Spirited girl]]
Moving on from this grand slam of[n]stupidity...

[msg MSG_083 [Yukari]]
So, I'm Yukari Takeba. I'm also a[n]second- year, and I'm in the archery[n]club.

[msg MSG_084 [Ann]]
Whoa, that really is her...!
Ah, I see―she got her posture and poses[n]from practicing archery...

[msg MSG_085 [Futaba]]
It's not just her looks, either. Her[n]acting is god-tier, too!

[msg MSG_086 [Yukari]]
Huh? What are you two talking about?

[msg MSG_087 [Futaba]]
Oops, uh... I just was talking about[n]Reiko Kujakuin―don't worry about it.

[msg MSG_088 [Yukari]]
O-Okay... I still don't get it... but[n]anyway, I think Fuuka's the last one[n]left, yeah?

[msg MSG_089 [Fuuka]]
...Oh, right! It's nice to meet you all.[n]I'm Fuuka Yamagishi.

[msg MSG_090 [Futaba]]
A-Another navigator comrade!

[msg MSG_091 [Rise]]
That's so amazing how we've got three[n]navigators now! I bet we're totally good[n]to go with the backup.

[msg MSG_092 [Futaba]]
U-Uh... R-Right! I-I-I hope we get[n]along!

[msg MSG_093 [Rise]]
Tell us everything you know about that[n]sci-fi movie world! Let's all work[n]together on this!

[msg MSG_094 [Fuuka]]
Yes, I look forward to it!

[msg MSG_095 [Mitsuru]]
There are two more members in our group,[n]but they've been separated from us...

[msg MSG_096 [P4 Hero]]
Yes, let's team up to find them as[n]quickly as we can.

[msg MSG_097 [Yosuke]]
Right! But, we should probably introduce[n]ourselves to you first...

[msg MSG_098]
We all introduced ourselves to the[n]students of Gekkoukan High...

[msg MSG_099 [Mitsuru]]
To think there are other Persona-users[n]besides us...

[msg MSG_100 [Yukari]]
Nagi-san and Hikari-chan aren't[n]Persona-users, right?
Were you here when the movie theater[n]first got all screwy?

[msg MSG_101 [Hikari]]
Um, I can't remember anything clearly...
When I came to, I was already here... My[n]memory's been hazy since then.

[msg MSG_102 [Naoto]]
And that mysterious being, Doe... He was[n]already here too, no?

[msg MSG_103 [Ryuji]]
Ain't this all that thing's fault? No[n]matter how you look at it, that Joe's[n]suspicious as hell...

[msg MSG_104 [Teddie]]
Ooh, did you call him Joe, because his[n]name's Doe? Heeheehee...

[msg MSG_105 [Ryuji]]
I ain't jokin' around! And who else[n]would I be talkin' about!?

[msg MSG_106 [Teddie]]
More importantly, Hikarin―I bet you[n]aren't lonely anymore now that we're all[n]here.

[msg MSG_107 [Hikari]]
Mmhm... It's really uplifting.

[msg MSG_108 [Makoto]]
I'm glad to hear that. Your expression[n]is much more relaxed compared to when we[n]first met, too.

[msg MSG_109 [Hikari]]
Huh? I-Is that so? I can't really[n]tell...

[sel SEL_110 top]
She's definitely changed.
She hasn't changed much.
I couldn't say for certain.

[msg MSG_111 [Futaba]]
I... I think so too!

[msg MSG_112 [Futaba]]
I... I think she's changed!

[msg MSG_113 [Futaba]]
You laugh more―and you talk more[n]compared to when we first met!

[msg MSG_114 [Nagi]]
Yes, I must say I agree. Disregarding[n]the situation we're currently in, I'm[n]glad for you.

[msg MSG_115 [Hikari]]
I see... I-I didn't know I was like[n]that...

[msg MSG_116 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Ohhhh! That reminds me!

[msg MSG_117 [Yukari]]
Huh!? What's up?

[msg MSG_118 [P3 Fem Protag]]
We picked this up in the movie earlier.[n]Whose Evoker could this be?

[msg MSG_119 [Mitsuru]]
...Good heavens!

[msg MSG_120 [Fuuka]]
Everyone was summoning their Persona in[n]that battle, no?

[msg MSG_121 [Shinjiro]]
Tch... Just one shitshow after another.
Aigis doesn't need an Evoker, so the one[n]who dropped this...

[msg MSG_122 [Ken]]
Our leader...

[msg MSG_123 [Koromaru]]
*whine*

[msg MSG_124 [Akihiko]]
Even if Aigis happens to be with him,[n]there's only so much she can handle. We[n]need to find and rescue them, pronto!

[msg MSG_125 [Mitsuru]]
Wait―there are too many of us to just[n]barge on into the movie. It'd be best to[n]consolidate our chain of command first.

[msg MSG_126 [P4 Hero]]
Ever since we joined up, we've been[n]leaving the command decisions to.
I believe it'd be best to continue this[n]strategy―what's your opinion?

[msg MSG_127 [Mitsuru]]
Hm... Would you mind?

[sel SEL_128 top]
Alright.
Leave it to me.
Uhhhh...

[msg MSG_129 [Mitsuru]]
Thank you. I apologize for putting you[n]on the spot, but we're trusting you with[n]our lives.

[msg MSG_130 [Morgana]]
Hey! Don't make it so obvious you don't[n]wanna do it!

[msg MSG_131 [Mitsuru]]
Of course, I don't intend on leaving you[n]in the lurch―I'll do my best to aid you[n]as well.

[msg MSG_132 [P4 Hero]]
And I'll continue providing backup too.[n]There's no need to worry.

[msg MSG_133 [Morgana]]
Now that that's been decided, let's get[n]moving.
We have even more companions now, so[n]let's make sure to go over our party[n]formation and prep our equipment!
