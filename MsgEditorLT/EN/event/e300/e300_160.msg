[msg MSG_000 [Ken]]
Yes! We took them all down!

[msg MSG_001 [Koromaru]]
Awoooo!

[msg MSG_002 [Rise]]
Hey, what about that robot? Is she[n]alright!?

[msg MSG_003 [Robot with a ribbon]]
......

[msg MSG_004 [Futaba]]
Hey, are you okay? I'm glad we made it[n]here in time...

[msg MSG_005 [Robot with a ribbon]]
WHO ARE YOU?
I DID NOT REQUEST ASSISTANCE.

[msg MSG_006 [Yukari]]
Huh?

[msg MSG_007 [Robot with a ribbon]]
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN FORMATTED ACCORDING[n]TO THE DETERMINED PROCEDURE.

[msg MSG_008 [Futaba]]
Wha―Why're you saying that? Getting[n]formatted is basically the same as[n]dying!

[msg MSG_009 [Robot with a ribbon]]
I AM DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER UNITS. MY[n]THOUGHT PROCESSES HAVE BECOME ABNORMAL.
I AM AN IRREGULARITY, RIDDLED WITH[n]ERRORS. I HAVE BECOME A DEFECTIVE UNIT.

[msg MSG_010 [Ryuji]]
Defective? All you did was realize that[n]you like flowers, right?

[msg MSG_011 [Robot with a ribbon]]
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

[msg MSG_012 [Ryuji]]
I don't really wanna explain it all[n]right now, but―we saw you in a trailer.

[msg MSG_013 [Robot with a ribbon]]
TRAILER...?

[msg MSG_014 [Futaba]]
Anyways―you don't need to be formatted!
Stop calling yourself an irregularity[n]just because there's something different[n]about you.

[msg MSG_015 [Robot with a ribbon]]
BUT THAT IS WHAT OUR OVERSEER HAS[n]DECREED. MY ONLY ROLE AS A UNIT IS TO[n]OBEY HIM.

[sel SEL_016 top]
There's no need to obey him.
Who is this so-called Overseer?

[msg MSG_017 [Robot with a ribbon]]
WHY IS THAT?

[msg MSG_018 [Haru]]
If you only followed the commands of[n]others for your whole life, there'd be[n]no personal meaning to exist, right?

[msg MSG_019 [Robot with a ribbon]]
A PERSONAL MEANING TO MY EXISTENCE?

[msg MSG_020 [Robot with a ribbon]]
THE ONE WHO GUIDES US TOWARDS WHAT WE[n]SHOULD BE―THAT IS WHO DETERMINES MY[n]MEANING TO EXIST.

[msg MSG_021 [Futaba]]
Talk about total control over everyone.[n]We'll take care of all that nonsense!

[msg MSG_022 [Robot with a ribbon]]
......

[msg MSG_023 [Mitsuru]]
Excuse me, do you know a robot named[n]Aigis? She looks quite similar to you.

[msg MSG_024 [Yukari]]
Also, a boy with an armband on―he has[n]long bangs that cover up one of his[n]eyes...

[msg MSG_025 [Robot with a ribbon]]
NO, I HAVE SEEN NO HUMANS.

[msg MSG_026 [Yukari]]
I see...

[msg MSG_027 [Robot with a ribbon]]
HOWEVER, I DID SEE A ROBOT WITH A[n]RIBBON. IT WAS THE SAME COLOR AS MY OWN.

[msg MSG_028 [Junpei]]
That's gotta be Ai-chan!

[msg MSG_029 [Mitsuru]]
Would you happen to know where that[n]robot went?

[msg MSG_030 [Robot with a ribbon]]
SHE WAS DEEMED A SECURITY THREAT AND[n]TAKEN TO THE LAB UP AHEAD.

[msg MSG_031 [Akihiko]]
What!?

[msg MSG_032 [Shinjiro]]
Tch... We're all in deep shit if we[n]don't hurry to this lab.

[msg MSG_033 [Mitsuru]]
Indeed, let's move out at once.

[msg MSG_034 [Futaba]]
Wait! What're we gonna do with this[n]robot?

[sel SEL_035 top]
Let's bring her along with us.
Let's hide her somewhere safe.

[msg MSG_036 [Futaba]]
Yeah, I'm sure she'll be helpful. Oh,[n]maybe she can guide us to the lab!

[msg MSG_037 [Teddie]]
An excellent idea! If any trouble is to[n]befall this precious bot, I shall[n]protect her!

[msg MSG_038 [Fuuka]]
That sounds like a good idea. If she[n]stays here, more robots are likely to[n]show up and capture her.
But, I can't find any places nearby that[n]are safe enough for her...

[msg MSG_039 [Teddie]]
Then why don't we serve as her escort?[n]If any trouble is to befall this[n]precious bot, I shall protect her!

[msg MSG_040 [Futaba]]
Yeah, I'm sure she'll be helpful. Oh,[n]maybe she can guide us to the lab!

[msg MSG_041 [Robot with a ribbon]]
I HAVE NOT BEEN DESIGNATED AS A GUIDE.

[msg MSG_042 [Yukari]]
But you know where the lab is, right?[n]All you'd have to do is take us there.

[msg MSG_043 [Robot with a ribbon]]
BUT, PERFORMING ACTIONS OUTSIDE OF OUR[n]ESTABLISHED PARAMETERS IS...

[msg MSG_044 [Ryuji]]
Well, you don't wanna get formatted, do[n]you?

[msg MSG_045 [Robot with a ribbon]]
......?

[msg MSG_046 [Ryuji]]

[msg MSG_047 [Robot with a ribbon]]
MY WILL?
...I DO NOT UNDERSTAND. WHY DO YOU WISH[n]TO PROTECT ME?

[msg MSG_048 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Well, there's the fact that you look[n]like Aigis―she's our companion...
But I guess it's more like... we want[n]you to value your ability to cherish[n]things?

[msg MSG_049 [Robot with a ribbon]]
I SHOULD VALUE THIS ABILITY?
WHY?
WHY... WHY DO I... WANT TO CHERISH[n]FLOWERS?
AND THIS WANTING TO KNOW WHY... IS THIS[n]ALSO A FEELING?

[msg MSG_050 [Haru]]
Why don't you come with us to the lab?[n]You may be able to find the answers[n]there.

[msg MSG_051 [Akihiko]]
That sounds like your best option. At[n]this rate, you're going to wind up[n]getting formatted, right?
So, you might as well let your feelings[n]guide you now.

[msg MSG_052 [Robot with a ribbon]]
......
VERY WELL... I WILL GO WITH YOU. I WANT[n]TO SATISFY THIS FEELING OF WANTING TO[n]KNOW WHY.

[msg MSG_053 [P3 Fem Protag]]
That takes care of that!

[msg MSG_054 [Futaba]]
Don't worry! If you suffer any[n]malfunctions on the way, I'll[n]disassemble―

[msg MSG_055 [Naoto]]
You'll do what!?

[msg MSG_056 [Futaba]]
Heheh, whoops―my bad! What I meant was,[n]all's well that ends well if nothing[n]goes wrong!

[msg MSG_057 [Morgana]]
Well, we found the robot that seems to[n]be the key to this movie. That's one of[n]our goals checked off the list.

[msg MSG_058 [P4 Hero]]
Our next step is to find the remaining[n]members of SEES.
Let's go!
