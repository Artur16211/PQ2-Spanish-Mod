Within A.I.G.I.S., Zone 1...

[msg MSG_001 [Chie]]
Now that we're actually in here, wow...[n]This looks so different from Yasoinaba!

[msg MSG_002 [Makoto]]
It's like the entire world is made with[n]CGI. It's all so flat and uniform.

[msg MSG_003 [Ann]]
Gah! What's happening...!?

[msg MSG_004 [Security interface]]
ID VERIFICATION IN PROGRESS...[n]VERIFICATION ERROR!
NO RECORDS FOUND. REGISTERING NEW[n]MODELS...

[msg MSG_005 [Yukiko]]
Verification? New models?

[msg MSG_006 [Security interface]]
REGISTERING INDIVIDUAL ID NUMBERS: TK-00[n]THROUGH 08― YS-00 THROUGH 07― IW-00...

[msg MSG_007 [Naoto]]
Assigning serial numbers as identities?[n]That's pretty standard fare for[n]dystopian sci-fi settings.

[msg MSG_008 [Yosuke]]
Daaaamn, this place really is just like[n]a sci-fi movie! I mean, that's exactly[n]what it is―but still!

[msg MSG_009 [Futaba]]
It's like a techno-wonderland!

[msg MSG_010 [Yukiko]]

[sel SEL_011 top]
Are you a film buff?
Yeah, they're great.

[msg MSG_012 [Yukiko]]
Mmhm―not just sci-fi ones, though. I[n]watch all sorts of genres.

[msg MSG_013 [Makoto]]
That's somewhat surprising. I had[n]imagined Yukiko-san to be more[n]traditional...

[msg MSG_014 [Yosuke]]
Well, Yukiko's sort of a... bundle of[n]surprises. Yeah.

[msg MSG_015 [Yukiko]]
Huh? What's that mean?

[msg MSG_016 [P4 Hero]]
It means we shouldn't judge people based[n]on their appearances...

[msg MSG_017 [Yusuke]]
Indeed. The geometric architecture is a[n]marriage of beauty and function... It[n]makes my heart dance with glee!

[msg MSG_018 [Kanji]]
It's kinda fun thinkin' about this[n]stuff― like, what do people in the[n]future eat?

[msg MSG_019 [Chie]]
Ooh, yeah, yeah! I'm totally curious! Do[n]you think I could get, like, some kind[n]of synthetic beef bowl?

[msg MSG_020 [Makoto]]
The trailer said this is a post-humanity[n]society, so I can't imagine that there's[n]any food to be found here.
This world's technology is cutting-edge,[n]but it's all so artificial-feeling,[n]too... It's rather eerie.

[msg MSG_021 [Haru]]
A sci-fi world, huh...

[msg MSG_022 [Morgana]]
You all right, Noir?

[msg MSG_023 [Haru]]
Yeah―this place just reminded me of my[n]father's Palace...
But, I'm getting used to it now. Thanks[n]for asking.

[msg MSG_024 [Teddie]]
So―time to start changing this movie![n]Which way should we go?

[msg MSG_025 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I guess we should start by looking for[n]that robot with the red ribbon...

[msg MSG_026 [Ann]]
Well, we can't just wander around[n]looking for her with these enemies all[n]over... What are we gonna do?

[msg MSG_027 [Teddie]]
Are you on edge, Ann-chan? I have a free[n]hand, if you'd like to hold it.

[msg MSG_028 [Morgana]]
Back off, bear! You're not pawing up[n]Panther on MY watch!

[msg MSG_029 [Teddie]]
Ohhhh, alriiiight. We can each hold one[n]of her hands to make it fair.

[msg MSG_030 [Morgana]]
Eh? Well... I guess that's fine.

[msg MSG_031 [Ann]]
No! Uh... Our heights are way too[n]different. It would hurt my back.

[msg MSG_032 [Morgana]]
Noooo...

[msg MSG_033 [P4 Hero]]
Um―back to the movie, though...
Are there any objections to searching[n]for that robot with a ribbon first?

[msg MSG_034 [Naoto]]
None here. That robot most likely holds[n]the key to this particular movie.

[sel SEL_035 top]
No objections here, either.
I want a synthetic beef bowl first.

[msg MSG_036 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Then it's decided! Let's try and find[n]her as quickly as possible!

[msg MSG_037 [Akechi]]
Haha... That reminds me, do you know[n]what the standard ingredient is for[n]manufactured meat in sci-fi films?

[msg MSG_038 [Chie]]
Ooh, what is it? Now I'm even more[n]curious!

[msg MSG_039 [Naoto]]
Why, ah... Why don't we talk about that[n]later? Let's focus on the search for[n]now.

[msg MSG_040 [Morgana]]
C'mon, let's move out! Keep your guard[n]up, folks!
