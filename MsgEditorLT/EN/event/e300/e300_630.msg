[msg MSG_000 [Ribbon]]
......
I... I...?

[msg MSG_001 [Aigis]]
Have you recovered?

[msg MSG_002 [P3 Hero]]
Ribbon... Thank goodness you booted back[n]up.

[msg MSG_003 [Ribbon]]
I... I...

[msg MSG_004 [Yukari]]
How are you? Do you remember who you[n]are?

[msg MSG_005 [Ribbon]]
I AM... UIY-2249...

[msg MSG_006 [Haru]]
Ah...

[msg MSG_007 [Ribbon]]
...No, I am Ribbon―Ribbon is my name.

[msg MSG_008 [Futaba]]
Ribbon!

[msg MSG_009 [Yosuke]]
Hell yeah! We did it!

[msg MSG_010 [Ribbon]]
What was I...?

[msg MSG_011 [Aigis]]
You were severely drained due to[n]activating Orgia Mode, and there was an[n]issue with your boot sequence.
That is why we temporarily connected you[n]to my system and attempted a restoration[n]that way.

[msg MSG_012 [Mitsuru]]
It was a gamble, but it seems to have[n]been successful.
But, to think that you had an Orgia Mode[n]too... Was that your doing, Oracle?

[msg MSG_013 [Futaba]]
Mweheheh! All I did was help to release[n]the limiters on it.
I simply rewrote the programming so[n]Ribbon could activate it at will.

[msg MSG_014 [Ribbon]]
Yes, I chose to fight alongside you.

[msg MSG_015 [Akihiko]]
Heh, that's an admirable attitude. Looks[n]like you've changed quite a bit, Ribbon.

[msg MSG_016 [Yusuke]]
And it's thanks to you that the Mother[n]Computer is gone. You're free now.

[sel SEL_017 top]
Good job, everyone.
Now what happens?

[msg MSG_018 [Naoto]]
Indeed. However, this isn't the real end[n]of everything.
What will become of this world and[n]Ribbon-san now?

[msg MSG_019 [Naoto]]
That's a good question. What do you plan[n]on doing now, Ribbon-san?

[msg MSG_020 [Ribbon]]
I believe, eventually, more of my[n]companions will emerge with[n]individualities.
To prepare for when that time comes, I[n]want to create a world where we can live[n]together, rather than be eliminated.

[msg MSG_021 [Morgana]]
Ooh, that's amazing! We'll be cheering[n]you on! Right, Joker?

[sel SEL_022 top]
We leave this world to you.
You can do it, Ribbon.

[msg MSG_023 [Ribbon]]
Thank you. I promise to make this dream[n]become a reality here.

[msg MSG_024 [Aigis]]
That is an admirable goal.

[msg MSG_025 [Ribbon]]
Aigis-san, thank you in particular...
We are both robots, but you were so free[n]that I was very confused at first.

[msg MSG_026 [P3 Hero]]
Did you hear that, Aigis?

[msg MSG_027 [Aigis]]
I am not special. However, speaking[n]hypothetically, if there were something[n]special about myself...
Then these companions would certainly[n]still accept me―for who I really am.

[msg MSG_028 [Ribbon]]
They would... still accept you?

[msg MSG_029 [Futaba]]
We're not the only ones who think this[n]way, either. I'm sure there'll be others[n]who'll accept you the way you are.
That's why you should make some new[n]companions too. If you do that, I'm sure[n]every day will be filled with fun.

[msg MSG_030 [Aigis]]
Ribbon-san, please hold onto what makes[n]you "special."

[msg MSG_031 [Ribbon]]
Yes... I will do my best!

[msg MSG_032 [Aigis]]
I am pleased to hear it!

[msg MSG_033 [Futaba]]
Become the best robot ever, Ribbon![n]Promise me you'll do that, okay!?

[msg MSG_034 [Ribbon]]
I promise, Oracle.

[msg MSG_034_5 [Ribbon]]
Thank you to everyone else as well.[n]Please take care...

[msg MSG_035 [Ken]]
There she goes...

[msg MSG_036 [P3 Fem Protag]]
So, I guess we've closed this case, huh?[n]We turned the ending into a happy one...

[msg MSG_037 [Yosuke]]
Ooh, now this is rare. Are you getting[n]all wistful too, [f 6 1 27 0 0 0]-chan?

[msg MSG_038 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Mmhm... I feel like I'm overwhelmed with[n]emotions.
Ribbon-chan had been alone all this[n]time... I guess I kept comparing my own[n]situation to hers.

[sel SEL_039 top]
Are you okay?
Are you feeling lonely?
None of us are alone here.

[msg MSG_040 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Thanks, but I'm alright! Plus, this[n]wasn't a sad ending.
Ribbon-chan will be able to feel like[n]she belongs now...

[msg MSG_040_3 [P3 Fem Protag]]
...And that makes me so happy for her.

[msg MSG_040_5 [Mitsuru]]
Hm... You sound almost as if you're[n]describing yourself.

[msg MSG_041 [Teddie]]
If you need to cry, I'll lend you my[n]chest. Come now, let it all out onto[n]Teddie!

[msg MSG_042 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Ahaha, thanks, but I'm okay. After all,[n]this wasn't a sad ending.
Ribbon-chan will be able to feel like[n]she belongs now...

[msg MSG_042_5 [P3 Fem Protag]]
...And that makes me so happy for her.

[msg MSG_043 [Mitsuru]]
Hm... You sound almost as if you're[n]describing yourself.

[msg MSG_045 [Mitsuru]]
Yes, that's right.

[msg MSG_046 [Mitsuru]]
It's only natural that you couldn't help[n]but sympathize with Ribbon―she felt all[n]alone in her world as well...
But now, neither of you are really[n]alone, no?

[msg MSG_047 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Huh?

[msg MSG_048 [Mitsuru]]
As someone who fights alongside us, you[n]have proven your loyalty and[n]dependability enough to earn our trust.

[msg MSG_049 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Mitsuru-senpai...!

[msg MSG_052 [Junpei]]
That's right. And what's more, you can[n]rely on me more than the me you know,[n]y'know?
I am the true hero fated to save the[n]world! Leave it to me, THE Junpei Iori![n]...Well, A Junpei.

[msg MSG_053 [Yukari]]
Ugh, my stomach's churning at the mere[n]thought of multiple Junpeis...
Even one's too many for our existence.

[msg MSG_054 [Junpei]]
Hey! If there was one less of me, I[n]wouldn't exist at all!

[msg MSG_055 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Ahahaha!

[msg MSG_056 [Fuuka]]
*giggle* Well then, I hope we can grow[n]to be even closer companions from here[n]on out.
I'll do my best with the backup, so[n]let's do what we can to escape this[n]world!
