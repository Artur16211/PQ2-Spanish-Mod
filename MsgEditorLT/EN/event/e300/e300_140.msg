...What's that?

[msg MSG_001 [Mysterious man's voice]]
There is no conflict, no crime, no greed[n]in this world of ours...
It is a perfect world, where a perfect[n]life is promised to all.

[msg MSG_002 [Futaba]]
"A perfect world"?

[msg MSG_003 [Mysterious man's voice]]
The reason such a world can be reality[n]is because everyone is the same.
Think about how fruitless it is to[n]contrast or stand out. Being like the[n]others―being normal―is optimal.

[msg MSG_004 [Akechi]]
Based on the content of this speech, the[n]speaker is likely the robots' Overseer.

[msg MSG_005 [Mysterious man's voice]]
Eyes to the right... Eyes to the left...[n]Malfunctioning units that fail to adhere[n]to normality will be eliminated.
On that note, may each robot focus on[n]their assigned tasks, with no ifs, ands,[n]or ro-buts.

[msg MSG_006 [Haru]]
...Was that a pun combining "robot" and[n]"but"?

[msg MSG_007 [Chie]]
Oh, is that what that was? I couldn't[n]tell at all.

[msg MSG_008 [Junpei]]
That lame-ass pun―no wonder it's got the[n]face of Ikutsuki-san.

[sel SEL_009 top]
That was extremely bad.
He's funnier than you, Junpei...
I found it rather punny.

[msg MSG_010 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Ahaha, that was so bad that I'd smack[n]him if he were in front of me right now!

[msg MSG_011 [Yosuke]]
You'd really smack your own school's[n]chairman...?

[msg MSG_012 [Yukari]]
Oh, let's be fair―I think they're pretty[n]much on the same level.

[msg MSG_013 [Junpei]]
Hey! I heard that!

[msg MSG_014 [Yukari]]
Oh no... Are you saying that's your kind[n]of humor?

[msg MSG_015 [Junpei]]
Hey, humor's important in a man. We'll[n]ignore whether it's actually funny or[n]not! Right?

[msg MSG_016 [Morgana]]
Junpei is making fun of you, Joker...

[msg MSG_017 [Mass produced robot]]
NO IFS, ANDS, OR RO-BUTS...

[msg MSG_018 [Mass produced robots]]
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

[msg MSG_019 [Mitsuru]]
What's with these robots? They suddenly[n]started laughing... Are they[n]malfunctioning?

[msg MSG_020 [Ken]]
Um, could it be possible that they were[n]actually amused by the pun?

[msg MSG_021 [Mass produced robot]]
......
...TIME TO RETURN TO OUR DUTIES.

[msg MSG_022 [Chie]]
Huh? They went back to work...

[msg MSG_023 [Futaba]]
It's just my suspicion, but I think they[n]all have the same AI loaded onto them.
They're programmed to focus only on[n]work, and to all have the same[n]reactions...

[msg MSG_024 [Yusuke]]
I see. It's just as the announcement and[n]the trailer said...
Spurning individuality and embracing[n]normality―that is what's seen as[n]acceptable here.

[msg MSG_025 [Shinjiro]]
Hmph... A world where everyone's forced[n]to be the same, huh? That's just[n]disgusting.

[msg MSG_026 [Yukiko]]
Isn't it suffocating to live every day[n]like that? Do they not care about the[n]issue because they're robots?

[msg MSG_027 [Yukari]]
No, I think our companion Aigis has her[n]own free will.

[msg MSG_028 [Akihiko]]
It's rare to find a robot with as much[n]personality as she has, but she's still[n]a good example of that.
I don't think someone has to always[n]behave a certain way, whether they're a[n]person or a robot.

[msg MSG_029 [Futaba]]
Ooh! Now my curiosity to see what kind[n]of robotics this lady's made of has been[n]maxed out!

[msg MSG_030 [Junpei]]
Just don't try takin' her apart, okay?

[msg MSG_031 [Naoto]]
U-Um... How do you think she would[n]respond if I were to ask her if... if I[n]could check out her parts as well?

[msg MSG_032 [Futaba]]
What's this? I'm sensing another[n]mecha-nut here too. Mweheheh... I can[n]understand your desires!

[msg MSG_033 [Mitsuru]]
As long as she's fine with it, I see no[n]issues... However, we need to prioritize[n]reuniting with her and our leader first.
Come now, let's hurry on.
