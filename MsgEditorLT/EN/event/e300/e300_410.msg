[msg MSG_000 [P3 Hero]]
Even now, I'm having trouble believing[n]that this is all just inside a movie...

[msg MSG_001 [Junpei]]
Tons of stuff that only happen in movies[n]keep happening here, though.

[msg MSG_002 [Junpei]]
Really, [f 6 1 16 0 0] and are what's[n]unbelievable right now.

[msg MSG_003 [Akihiko]]
Parallel worlds, huh...
I'm not sure I get it, but it means[n]there's another set of us in some other[n]world, right?

[msg MSG_004 [P3 Fem Protag]]
...Yes.

[msg MSG_005 [Mitsuru]]
And our personalities in both worlds are[n]essentially the same, existing at the[n]same time.
From what I've heard, our skills and[n]living conditions are the same as well.[n]So... why are only those two different?

[msg MSG_006 [P3 Hero]]
Pretty interesting, huh?

[msg MSG_007 [Junpei]]
"Interesting"!? THAT'S all you have to[n]say about it? Man, you're just as[n]nonchalant as always...

[msg MSG_008 [Akihiko]]
"I am her and she's me..."
Ever since [f 6 1 16 0 0] said that, it's become[n]obvious that you two are similar in some[n]way.

[msg MSG_009 [Ken]]
Oh, I've been thinking that the entire[n]time...
I mean, their personalities are[n]different, but... I can't explain it[n]well.

[msg MSG_009_1 [Yukari]]
It does feel weird, though. I was sort[n]of confused at first...
But now that I've gotten to know her[n]more, she fits in the group just like a[n]glove... I wonder why that is?

[msg MSG_009_2 [P4 Hero]]
The length of time spent together isn't[n]what matters―it's the depth of trust[n]that's been built.

[msg MSG_009_3 [Ken]]
I agree with that.

[msg MSG_009_4 [Junpei]]
A-yep! Like they say: how beautiful it[n]is to have good friends!

[msg MSG_010 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_012 [Shinjiro]]
Well, we were all saved in different[n]ways thanks to [f 6 1 27 0 0 0] bein' with us.
She's our companion, and that's more[n]than enough for now.

[msg MSG_013 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Th-Thank you, Shinjiro-senpai!

[msg MSG_014 [Teddie]]
That's right! We're all companions!

[msg MSG_015 [Akihiko]]
Considering the situation we're in, it's[n]only natural that we feel down at[n]times...
But, I think we can handle it if we keep[n]working together like this.

[msg MSG_016 [P3 Hero]]
Me too. I can't wait to fight alongside[n]everyone else.

[sel SEL_017 top]
Same here.
I'm not stepping down as leader.

[msg MSG_018 [Morgana]]
I feel like we can take down anything[n]with our combined strength!

[msg MSG_019 [Ryuji]]
Dude, you really don't need to be so[n]hung up on that...

[msg MSG_020 [Yukari]]
Well then―why don't we keep moving?

[msg MSG_021 [P3 Hero]]
Yeah. I'd better prepare for what's[n]coming.

[msg MSG_022 [P4 Hero]]
I'm excited to see what our new[n]companions can do.
