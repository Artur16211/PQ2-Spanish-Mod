I HAVE A QUESTION FOR EVERYONE.

[msg MSG_001 [Makoto]]
What's the matter?

[msg MSG_002 [Ribbon]]
THERE IS SOMETHING I CANNOT UNDERSTAND[n]IN REGARDS TO YOUR ACTIONS.
WHY DO YOU RECOGNIZE AIGIS-SAN AS AN[n]"INDIVIDUAL"?

[msg MSG_003 [Yukari]]
Why...?

[msg MSG_004 [Ribbon]]
AIGIS-SAN IS A ROBOT. SHE IS NOT AN[n]ORGANIC BEING, LIKE THE REST OF YOU.

[msg MSG_005 [P3 Hero]]
That's an easy one...
It's because she's our companion. No[n]other reason besides that.

[msg MSG_006 [Ribbon]]
YOUR COMPANION...?

[msg MSG_007 [Mitsuru]]
When it comes to recognizing somebody as[n]one of our own, it doesn't matter[n]whether they're organic or inorganic.
We fight together and push forward[n]together. Those reasons are more than[n]enough for us.

[msg MSG_008 [Ribbon]]
BUT, MY "COMPANIONS" RECOGNIZE ME AS AN[n]ERROR. THEY WILL NOT HELP ME.

[msg MSG_009 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hey, Ribbon-chan―how would you describe[n]a "companion"?

[msg MSG_010 [Ribbon]]
I RECOGNIZE THE TERM AS DEFINING THOSE[n]WITH THE SAME APPEARANCE, ABILITIES, AND[n]LACK OF ERRORS.

[msg MSG_011 [Futaba]]
Your use of that word... "Error"... I[n]can't explain why, but I sure don't like[n]it.

[msg MSG_012 [Ribbon]]
THEN, A DISQUALIFICATION, OR A[n]DEFECTIVE―

[msg MSG_013 [Futaba]]
None of that either!

[msg MSG_014 [Ryuji]]
Man, all those words sound like the shit[n]some high'n'mighty asshole would say.
It's bullshit how they're forcing these[n]selfish rules on the whole society!

[msg MSG_015 [Ribbon]]
BUT, RULES ARE MEANT TO BE FOLLOWED...

[sel SEL_016 top]
You don't have to follow them.
You're not an error, Ribbon.

[msg MSG_017 [Ribbon]]
I AM... NOT AN ERROR?

[msg MSG_018 [Makoto]]
Say, Ribbon. Why don't you try going[n]along with our own beliefs while you're[n]with us?

[msg MSG_019 [Ann]]
That sounds like a great idea.
You don't have to keep following some[n]self-centered Overseer's nonsense!

[msg MSG_020 [Chie]]
Mmhm. And if those bots try something[n]again, we'll protect you with everything[n]we got!

[msg MSG_021 [Ribbon]]
YOU'LL PROTECT ME? BUT, WHY HELP A UNIT[n]SUCH AS MYSELF?

[msg MSG_022 [P3 Fem Protag]]
*giggle* Remember what we said earlier?[n]The answer to this one's simple, too...
It's because you're just as much of a[n]companion to us as Aigis, Ribbon-chan.

[msg MSG_023 [Ribbon]]
I... AM A COMPANION?
......
SO, THIS IS WHAT BEING A COMPANION IS[n]LIKE... I COMPREHEND.

[msg MSG_024 [Aigis]]
I comprehend.

[msg MSG_025 [Ken]]
Heheh, their speech patterns are syncing[n]up.

[msg MSG_026 [Aigis]]
I'm sorry. I could not help myself.

[msg MSG_027 [P3 Fem Protag]]
*giggle* Oh, Aigis...
Well then, let's start over. Are you[n]ready to go, Ribbon-chan?

[msg MSG_028 [Ribbon]]
YES. I AM YOUR COMPANION. I SHALL[n]PROCEED ONWARD WITH YOU!

[msg MSG_029 [Akihiko]]
Heh, that's the spirit. Keep it up.

[msg MSG_030 [P3 Hero]]
Then, shall we get back on track? I hope[n]we can stick together, Ribbon.
