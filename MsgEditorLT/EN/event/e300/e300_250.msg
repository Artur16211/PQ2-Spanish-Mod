[msg MSG_000 [Futaba]]
Whoaaaaaa! This... This is amazing!

[msg MSG_001 [Ken]]
Could this be a facility used by humans[n]in the past?

[msg MSG_002 [Akechi]]
Most likely...
Though now, it seems to be used by the[n]robots to create more robots.

[msg MSG_003 [Chie]]
Wowww... This is seriously just like a[n]sci-fi movie!

[msg MSG_004 [Yosuke]]
There's nothing "like" about it. We're[n]literally inside a sci-fi movie.

[msg MSG_005 [Kanji]]
Huh, sci-fi... Which ones are those[n]again?

[msg MSG_006 [Yosuke]]
Like I just said―this! This, right now![n]What you're looking at right now is[n]sci-fi!

[msg MSG_007 [Teddie]]
Oho... So, are ice creams and juices[n]sold in sci-fi worlds too?

[msg MSG_008 [Yosuke]]
How would I know!? That's the last thing[n]you need right now, anyway!

[msg MSG_009 [Junpei]]
Hey, do you think Yosuke could actually[n]be the sassy type?

[msg MSG_010 [Ann]]
Now that you mention it, he's always[n]talking back like his life depends on[n]it...

[msg MSG_011 [Yosuke]]

Don't you get why my snark is so[n]important, Joker?

[sel SEL_012 top]
I totally understand.
I don't really get it...
Who's the Joker here?

[msg MSG_013 [Yosuke]]
Right? Seriously, I'm tryin' to do you[n]guys a service here...

[msg MSG_014 [Yosuke]]
If you stick with us long enough, you'll[n]get it... Even after you don't want to[n]anymore.

[msg MSG_015 [Yosuke]]
YOU! Don't make me rip that mask off!

[msg MSG_016 [P4 Hero]]
But, it really is thanks to Yosuke that[n]the Investigation Team's conversations[n]can carry on as well as they do.

[msg MSG_017 [Yosuke]]
Now that's my partner! You truly[n]understand my woes...

[msg MSG_018 [Shinjiro]]
When you get a big group of people[n]together, it's only natural that trouble[n]comes too. It's all up to personalities.

[msg MSG_019 [Naoto]]
The members of SEES are quite full of[n]personality as well...

[msg MSG_020 [Ken]]
We've all grown accustomed to our group[n]by now, but I guess it'd look rather[n]strange to an outsider.
But it's actually pretty fun, since we[n]have so many different types of people[n]together.

[msg MSG_021 [Yusuke]]
Indeed. The Persona-users we've[n]encountered are all highly fascinating[n]and brimming with personality.
It's made me realize just how ordinary I[n]am.

[sel SEL_022 top]
Uh... "Ordinary"?
That's correct.
What are you talking about?

[msg MSG_023 [Ryuji]]
Are you kidding me!?

[msg MSG_024 [Makoto]]
You're definitely not ordinary, Fox. If[n]anything, you're... exceedingly unique.

[msg MSG_025 [Yusuke]]
What!? Is this true?

[msg MSG_026 [Yukari]]
So you didn't have a clue, huh? Well, I[n]guess that's just how it is for unique[n]people...

[msg MSG_027 [Yusuke]]
I suppose I need to study everyone else[n]closely and learn to be more unique.

[msg MSG_028 [Yukari]]
Uh, you're already way too unique... In[n]all honesty, you're like the living[n]embodiment of weird.

[msg MSG_029 [Yusuke]]
Did I say something peculiar?

[msg MSG_030 [Makoto]]
You're definitely not ordinary, Fox. If[n]anything, you're... exceedingly unique.

[msg MSG_031 [Yusuke]]
What!? Is this true?

[msg MSG_032 [Yukari]]
So you didn't have a clue, huh? Well, I[n]guess that's just how it is for unique[n]people...

[msg MSG_033 [Yusuke]]
From my own point of view, everyone else[n]seemed so much more unique than I...
But, such uniqueness is essential to[n]art―so I've chosen to accept your input[n]as praise.

[msg MSG_034 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Well, that's all well and good, but that[n]kind of individuality isn't something[n]they praise in this world, right?

[msg MSG_035 [Ribbon]]
CORRECT. INDIVIDUALITY IS AN ERROR.[n]DIFFERING FROM OTHERS IS SUBOPTIMAL.
IF THE POPULATION ATTAINED[n]INDIVIDUALITY, THIS WORLD'S HARMONY[n]WOULD BE DISRUPTED...
AND ITS MANAGEMENT WOULD GROW TOO[n]COSTLY. INDIVIDUALITY IS AN EVIL―THIS IS[n]OUR PROGRAMMING.

[msg MSG_036 [Ryuji]]
Ugh... I guess that probably makes sense[n]to the Overseer, but...

[msg MSG_037 [Futaba]]
Being told you shouldn't exist, just[n]because you're different, or weird?
...That's nothing but forcing someone's[n]norms onto everyone else!

[msg MSG_038 [Makoto]]
Oracle...

[msg MSG_039 [Mitsuru]]
I certainly agree... Plus, a homogenized[n]world would be far too bland, and any[n]harmony in it would be artificial.

[msg MSG_040 [Ribbon]]
DESPITE THAT, I AM STILL CONSIDERED[n]NOTHING BUT AN ERROR IN THIS WORLD.

[sel SEL_041 top]
You're not an error.
The Overseer is wrong.

[msg MSG_042 [Ribbon]]
IS THAT SO...?

[msg MSG_043 [Junpei]]
Yeah, whoever decided all these crappy[n]laws is totally wrong.

[msg MSG_045 [Chie]]
Ugh... Just thinking about it is pissing[n]me off! I can't wait to kick all this[n]nonsense outta him!

[msg MSG_046 [Futaba]]
Agreed. We've gotta change this movie[n]into one that's less oppressive and more[n]fun!

[msg MSG_047 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_048 [Morgana]]
Well then, let's push forward! This is[n]the enemy's stronghold, so don't let[n]your guard down!
