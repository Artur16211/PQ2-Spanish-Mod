[msg MSG_000 [P3 Hero]]
. It's nice to meet you.
And you're the one who's been leading[n]everyone here, right?
Would it be okay for me to ask you to[n]continue on as our leader and give me[n]commands as well?

[sel SEL_001 top]
Leave it to me.
I don't care.

[msg MSG_002 [P3 Hero]]
Thanks, I'll leave it to you then.
Is everyone okay with that?

[msg MSG_003 [Mitsuru]]
Yes. We're the newcomers in this place.[n]The wisest strategy would be to follow[n]their lead.

[msg MSG_004 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_005 [Ken]]
Koromaru seems to agree. I also have no[n]objections.

[msg MSG_006 [Yukari]]
What the―It's like he's doing an[n]impression of somebody he just met!

[msg MSG_007 [P3 Hero]]
Really? Do I say that?

[msg MSG_008 [Junpei]]
You should know!

[msg MSG_009 [P3 Hero]]
Well, in any case, you're in charge.

[msg MSG_010 [P3 Fem Protag]]
......

[msg MSG_011 [P3 Hero]]
Now, we need to try and figure a few[n]things out―mainly about her and myself.

[msg MSG_012 [Chie]]
-chan recognizes everyone else in SEES,[n]but they don't know her... Is that it?

[msg MSG_013 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Mmhm. The only one that I don't know is[n][f 6 1 16 0 0]-kun... or at least, I think so...
But, when I first saw him... he didn't[n]feel at all like a stranger to me.
I can't explain it well, but it was[n]almost like nostalgia... or some kind of[n]closeness.

[msg MSG_014 [Junpei]]
Ooooooh! Is she about to confess her[n]feelings for him!?

[msg MSG_015 [Yukari]]
*sigh* You really can't get your mind[n]off that stuff, can you? What a simple[n]boy...

[msg MSG_016 [Junpei]]
But you don't know anything about[n]either―right,?
So we don't have any clues to work with![n]Even an Ace Detective like me couldn't[n]solve this.

[msg MSG_017 [Yusuke]]
I'm not sure I understand, but those[n]people in blue had said that normally,[n]they aren't supposed to cross paths.

[msg MSG_018 [P3 Hero]]
Well, I have to admit: I feel the same[n]way does...
I've never met her, or talked to her...[n]But, for some reason, I feel like I know[n]her.

[msg MSG_019 [Yukari]]
Same here―for all of us. We've already[n]mentioned to each other that it doesn't[n]feel like our first time meeting her...

[msg MSG_020 [P3 Hero]]
In her world, I'm the only one that[n]wasn't in SEES. That would mean...

[msg MSG_021 [P3 Hero]]
She is me, and I'm her... possibly?

[msg MSG_022 [Yosuke]]
Wha―What are you talking about!?

[msg MSG_023 [Teddie]]
Hmhm... So, it's like how I am also such[n]a pretty boy, and that pretty boy is[n]also me?

[msg MSG_024 [Chie]]
Stay outta this! Don't make it even more[n]confusing!

[msg MSG_025 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I'm him, and he's me...?

[sel SEL_026 top]
That's got to be it.
I don't get it.
They seem to agree.

[msg MSG_027 [Teddie]]
Ooooh! Does that mean they're of one[n]flesh?

[msg MSG_028 [Teddie]]
Aww, how innocent... Their declarations[n]are truly proof that they're of one[n]flesh!

[msg MSG_029 [Teddie]]
*squeal* They've made their electrifying[n]declarations to each other―that proves[n]they're of one flesh!

[msg MSG_030 [Teddie]]
*whistle* You two are so intimate!

[msg MSG_031 [Junpei]]
A boy and a girl, coming of age in two[n]different worlds―never meant to meet...
However, through a twist of fate, their[n]paths have crossed and nothing will be[n]the same!

[msg MSG_032 [Akihiko]]
Hey, now's not the time to be making[n]movie trailers.
This problem affects you too, right? You[n]should be more serious about this.

[msg MSG_033 [Yukari]]
Hmm... Those blue people might know[n]something, but―

[msg MSG_034 [Aigis]]
The residents of the Velvet Room,[n]correct?

[msg MSG_035 [Ken]]
Aigis-san!?

[msg MSG_036 [Shinjiro]]
Are you sure you should be walkin'[n]around already?

[msg MSG_037 [Aigis]]
Yes, I'm fully recovered. I apologize[n]for worrying everyone.

[msg MSG_038 [Fuuka]]
What a relief... Now all our members are[n]safe.

[msg MSG_039 [Theodore]]
Excuse me―my apologies for rudely[n]interrupting your rejoicing of your[n]friend's recovery...

[msg MSG_040 [Elizabeth]]
We sensed as if someone was calling for[n]us, and so we have made ourselves[n]present.

[msg MSG_041 [P3 Hero]]
Elizabeth... Would you happen to know[n]anything about what's going on with us?

[msg MSG_042 [Elizabeth]]
No. Unfortunately, I know nothing in[n]satisfactory detail...
...Except that [f 6 1 27 0 0 0] came to this[n]theater, and this realm, through the[n]Velvet Room.

[msg MSG_043 [Akechi]]
There is meaning to this phenomenon.[n]After all, nothing meaningless happens[n]there, correct?

[msg MSG_044 [Margaret]]
Most assuredly.
If this meeting was a necessity, then[n]the reason should eventually reveal[n]itself.

[msg MSG_045 [P3 Fem Protag]]
A necessary meeting, eh?

[msg MSG_046 [Mitsuru]]
So, there's a meaning to all of us[n]gathering here from different[n]dimensions...
In all honesty, I've yet to fully grasp[n]it myself... but I do know one thing.
The help of everyone present is required[n]for us to leave this movie theater.
And this, of course, applies to you as[n]well, [f 6 1 26 0 0 0]. Will you fight alongside[n]us?

[msg MSG_047 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Mitsuru-senpai...!

[msg MSG_048 [Ryuji]]
Heheh, looks like that wrapped up real[n]nice.

[msg MSG_049 [Justine]]
To think this many with the power of the[n]wild card would converge... This is[n]quite the spectacle.

[msg MSG_050 [Kanji]]
Whoa! You scared the shit outta me![n]You're so tiny, I didn't even see ya[n]there...

[msg MSG_051 [Caroline]]
Did you just call us tiny!? Watch your[n]mouth, you bottle-blond gorilla!

[msg MSG_052 [Kanji]]
Whaaa...!?

[msg MSG_053 [Yukiko]]
Snrk... Heehee... Kanji-kun, a[n]gorilla... Pfft... Ahaha! Ahahahahahaha!

[msg MSG_054 [Haru]]
*giggle* Y-You shouldn't laugh at that,[n]Yukiko-chan... *giggle*

[msg MSG_055 [Hikari]]
Heheh...

[msg MSG_056 [Kanji]]
You're all so cruel...

[msg MSG_057 [Nagi]]
This movie theater used to be too[n]quiet... It's grown so lively now that[n]everyone's gathered here.

[msg MSG_058 [Caroline]]
This will be a test of your leadership,[n]Inmate. Band together with your[n]companions well―or else!

[sel SEL_059 top]
I will.
This is all too much for me.

[msg MSG_060 [Justine]]
This is easier said than done. Prove[n]yourself with your actions.

[msg MSG_061 [Justine]]
We won't permit you to neglect your[n]duties.

[msg MSG_062 [Morgana]]
Well, it looks like we've got ourselves[n]some new companions.
We should make sure to prepare them[n]before heading back into the movie.
