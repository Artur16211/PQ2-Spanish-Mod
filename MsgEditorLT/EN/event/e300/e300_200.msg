[msg MSG_000 [Koromaru]]
Bark! Bark!

[msg MSG_001 [Ken]]
Did you find something, Koromaru?

[msg MSG_002 [Koromaru]]
Arf arf!

[msg MSG_003 [Naoto]]
Um, what is Koromaru-san saying?

[msg MSG_004 [Junpei]]
Hmm... He said, "Arf arf!"

[msg MSG_005 [Yukari]]
*sigh* Are you stupid? We all heard[n]that.
Man, I wish Aigis was here... She'd know[n]what he's saying.

[msg MSG_006 [Ribbon]]
"I SMELL OUR COMPANIONS HERE. THEY[n]SHOULD BE UP AHEAD," IS WHAT HE SAID.

[msg MSG_007 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Ribbon-chan, you can understand what[n]Koromaru says?

[msg MSG_008 [Ribbon]]
YES. I HAVE BEEN PROGRAMMED WITH THE[n]ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND MULTIPLE[n]LANGUAGES.

[msg MSG_009 [Ken]]
Wow... That's the same as Aigis-san!

[msg MSG_010 [Ribbon]]
PLEASE COME THIS WAY.

[msg MSG_010_05 [Ribbon]]
BEYOND THIS DOOR IS THE RESEARCH LAB[n]USED BY SPECIALIZED WORKER ROBOTS.
UNITS WITH SEVERE ERRORS ARE SENT HERE[n]TO BE DISMANTLED AND ANALYZED.

[msg MSG_011 [Haru]]
Dismantling... You mean they tear them[n]apart?

[msg MSG_012 [Futaba]]
That's even worse than dying... It's[n]like they're being executed.

[msg MSG_013 [Yusuke]]
How do we get inside? It seems to be[n]locked.

[msg MSG_014 [Ribbon]]
TO UNLOCK THIS DOOR, PLEASE COME THIS[n]WAY.

[msg MSG_015 [Ryuji]]
What's goin' on here?

[msg MSG_016 [Ribbon]]
THESE ARE THE ENTRANCES TO THE[n]INSPECTION FACILITIES FOR ALL[n]MASS-PRODUCED ROBOTS.
BEYOND EACH OF THESE ELEVATORS IS A[n]SWITCH TO RELEASE THE LOCK ON THE LAB[n]ENTRANCE.
ONCE ALL THREE SWITCHES HAVE BEEN[n]PRESSED, YOU WILL GAIN ENTRY TO THE LAB.

[msg MSG_017 [Ann]]
What are those words printed on them?
"Power," "Knowledge," and[n]"Adaptation"... What's all that about?

[msg MSG_018 [Ribbon]]
YOU WILL FACE INSPECTION BASED ON THOSE[n]THREE ATTRIBUTES.

[msg MSG_019 [Kanji]]
Well, I get "Power" and "Knowledge," but[n]what's the "Adaptation" one?

[msg MSG_020 [Ribbon]]
IT IS AN EXAM DETERMINING ONE'S ABILITY[n]TO PERFORM DUTIES, EVEN UNDER EXTREME[n]CIRCUMSTANCES.
UNLESS ALL THREE STANDARDS ARE MET, YOU[n]WILL BE DESIGNATED AS DEFECTIVE AND[n]DENIED ENTRY.

[msg MSG_021 [Mitsuru]]
Basically, they're similar to vocational[n]ability tests and qualifying exams. It[n]seems this won't be easy...

[msg MSG_022 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Do you think you could pass these exams,[n]Ribbon-chan?

[msg MSG_023 [Ribbon]]
I BELIEVE MY PROBABILITY IS LOW,[n]CONSIDERING HOW I WAS DESIGNATED[n]ERRONEOUS DUE TO IRREGULARITIES.

[msg MSG_024 [P4 Hero]]
But, getting past this is our only[n]way... Is it even safe for humans to go[n]in there?

[msg MSG_025 [Ribbon]]
THERE IS NO DATA ON THAT.

[msg MSG_026 [Yukiko]]
I suppose that makes sense―there aren't[n]any humans in this world. So, what[n]should we do?

[msg MSG_027 [P3 Fem Protag]]
We'll just have to go in―even if we[n]don't know what'll happen. Don't worry,[n]we're gonna blow those exams away!

[msg MSG_028 [Junpei]]
Whoa, now that's confidence... But[n]seriously, how gutsy are you!?

[msg MSG_029 [Morgana]]
Ah, a claim befitting a phantom thief!
We've gotten through countless scrapes[n]like these with the exact same attitude!

[msg MSG_030 [Naoto]]

[msg MSG_031 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Then we've got our orders! Everyone,[n]time to roll out!

[msg MSG_032 [Shinjiro]]
Ha... Talk about one helluva tomboy[n]we've got here.
Well, mullin' over shit ain't my thing,[n]either. Let's get in there.

[msg MSG_033 [Akihiko]]
I hear you―standing around here chatting[n]all day isn't going to do us any good.[n]Let's go.

[msg MSG_034 [Mitsuru]]
Seriously, you two...
However, they do have a point: we don't[n]have any time to waste. How should we[n]handle these exams?

[sel SEL_035 top]
How about one at a time?
Let's split up into three groups.

[msg MSG_036 [Akechi]]
That would be too inefficient...[n]Wouldn't it just waste more of our time?

[msg MSG_037 [Yukiko]]
How about we split up into three groups,[n]then?

[msg MSG_038 [Mitsuru]]
Indeed―let's do that. It'd be much more[n]efficient than the alternative.

[msg MSG_039 [Akihiko]]
I'll handle the "Power" exam. Are you[n]good with that one too, Shinji? Junpei?

[msg MSG_040 [Shinjiro]]
Quit makin' decisions for me, moron.
Tch... Fine. I guess I'll give you a[n]hand.

[msg MSG_041 [Junpei]]
No objections here, either! A man's[n]gotta take challenges like this head-on!

[msg MSG_042 [Yukiko]]
Kanji-kun is a "Power" type too, right?

[msg MSG_043 [Kanji]]
Right!

[msg MSG_044 [Teddie]]
Ooh, I know! I'll accompany Chie-chan to[n]the "Power" exam!

[msg MSG_045 [Chie]]
You're volunteering me!? But, there[n]aren't any other girls on the team!

[msg MSG_046 [Yosuke]]
Well, "Knowledge" and "Adaptation"[n]aren't exactly your strong suits...

[msg MSG_047 [Chie]]
Wha―Aw, man... I can't argue with[n]that...

[msg MSG_048 [Ryuji]]
Oh, then if that's how we're deciding,[n]I'll go to "Power" too. No other choice[n]for me here.

[msg MSG_049 [Makoto]]
I suppose Oracle and I should take on[n]the "Knowledge" exam? I'm confident with[n]any simple intelligence problems...

[msg MSG_050 [Mitsuru]]
I'll choose "Knowledge" as well. I've[n]studied the general matters of imperial[n]governance.

[msg MSG_051 [Morgana]]
Don't forget about me! I'm the brains of[n]the Phantom Thieves!

[msg MSG_052 [Yosuke]]
Then I count for "Knowledge" too! I'm[n]the chief of operations for the[n]Investigation Team, y'know.

[msg MSG_053 [Yukiko]]
Huh? Really? Since when?

[msg MSG_054 [Yosuke]]
Since the first day, dammit!

[msg MSG_055 [Naoto]]
Allow me to go to "Knowledge" as well. I[n]may be of some use.

[msg MSG_056 [Akechi]]
I'll go there as well. It may not be[n]obvious, but I'm a detective in training[n]all the same.

[msg MSG_057 [Yukiko]]
Then the last one is "Adaptation"...
I think I can manage that, since I deal[n]with customers every day.

[msg MSG_058 [Yusuke]]
Ha... I'm quite confident when it comes[n]to adaptability as well.
My creativity shines no matter the[n]circumstances I'm in, and I manage to[n]feed myself even when I have no money.

[msg MSG_059 [Makoto]]
I think you could use a bit more common[n]sense... Anyway, Fox goes to[n]"Adaptation."

[msg MSG_060 [Ann]]
Mind if I join in? I've lived both[n]overseas and in Japan, so I think my[n]adaptability is pretty solid.

[msg MSG_061 [Haru]]
I'll go to "Adaptation" as well. I think[n]I'd be a better fit there than with the[n]other options.

[msg MSG_062 [Ken]]
Koromaru and I will go that way too.[n]That'll balance out the number of[n]people.

[msg MSG_063 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_064 [Yukari]]
I think I'll go to "Adaptation" too. I'm[n]in the archery club, so I think my focus[n]will come in handy...

[msg MSG_065 [Futaba]]
Where do you want to go, Ribbon? Are you[n]proficient in any of these?

[msg MSG_066 [Ribbon]]
I AM AN AVERAGE, GENERAL-PURPOSE UNIT.
THUS, I HAVE NO SPECIALIZED SKILLS. WHAT[n]SHOULD I DO?

[sel SEL_067 top]
Come with me.
Choose whichever you prefer.
Wait for us here.

[msg MSG_068 [Futaba]]
I'd feel better if you were with her,[n]Joker. You take care of that lil' bot!

[msg MSG_069 [Ribbon]]
JOKER-SAN, I AM IN YOUR CARE.

[msg MSG_070 [Ribbon]]
WHAT I PREFER? I HAVE NO DESIRE IN[n]PARTICULAR REGARDING THIS.

[msg MSG_071 [Morgana]]
Then, wouldn't it be safest for her to[n]stay with Joker? He is our Leader and[n]everything!

[msg MSG_072 [Futaba]]
Ah, I'd feel better that way too. Take[n]care of that lil' bot!

[msg MSG_073 [Ribbon]]
UNDERSTOOD. I AM IN YOUR CARE.

[msg MSG_074 [Ann]]
It's too dangerous to leave her here by[n]herself. Those robots are hunting her[n]down.

[msg MSG_075 [Morgana]]
Then, wouldn't it be safest for her to[n]stay with Joker? He is our Leader and[n]everything!

[msg MSG_076 [Futaba]]
Ah, I'd feel better that way too. Take[n]care of that lil' bot!

[msg MSG_077 [Ribbon]]
UNDERSTOOD. I AM IN YOUR CARE.

[msg MSG_078 [Akechi]]
Joker, [f 6 1 12 0 0 0]-kun, and-san are the only[n]ones left...
This is just an idea, but what if we[n]have them act as the three teams'[n]leaders?

[msg MSG_079 [Ann]]
Oh, yeah... Joker has to join one of the[n]teams too.

[msg MSG_080 [Teddie]]
Sensei is always our leader, so he'd be[n]a perfect actor for the role!

[msg MSG_081 [Yosuke]]
Right―I can definitely vouch for his[n]leadership. Isn't that right, partner?

[msg MSG_082 [Akechi]]
How about you, [f 6 1 26 0 0 0]-san? Would you be[n]all right with acting as a team leader?

[msg MSG_083 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Oh―I don't mind, if it's okay with[n]everyone else...

[msg MSG_084 [P4 Hero]]
This is just my own opinion, but I[n]think-san is well-suited for being a[n]leader.
She seems to understand the SEES members[n]well, too.

[msg MSG_085 [Haru]]
Mmhm, I thought the same. She seems[n]quite deft at dealing with everyone's[n]personalities.

[msg MSG_086 [Yukari]]
Um... What should we do?

[msg MSG_087 [Junpei]]
It's more than fine by me. Having a girl[n]leader is like a dream!

[msg MSG_088 [Akihiko]]
No issues from me either. If anything[n]were to go down during the exam, all I'd[n]have to do is provide her backup.

[msg MSG_089 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_090 [Ken]]
I agree. It almost feels natural to see[n]her as a leader...

[msg MSG_091 [Mitsuru]]
That's true... If it's all right by you,[n]would you agree to lead us, [f 6 1 26 0 0 0]?

[msg MSG_092 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Th-Thank you! Please... leave it to me!

[msg MSG_093 [Shinjiro]]

[msg MSG_094 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Sure!

[msg MSG_095 [Morgana]]
All that's left is where you're gonna[n]go, Joker. Which exam do you prefer?

[sel SEL_096 top]
"Power."
"Knowledge."
"Adaptation."

[msg MSG_097 [Akihiko]]
Oh? Confident in your physical strength,[n]are ya? Alright, then let's put your[n]skills up against Shinji's and mine!

[msg MSG_098 [Shinjiro]]
Stop draggin' me into your childish[n]shit! Go put your skills up yourself!

[msg MSG_099 [Ribbon]]
I UNDERSTAND. I WILL ACCOMPANY YOU TO[n]"POWER."

[msg MSG_100 [P4 Hero]]
Well then, I'll go to "Knowledge."

[msg MSG_101 [P3 Fem Protag]]
And I'll go to "Adaptation."

[msg MSG_102 [Yosuke]]
Ooh? Are you the advisor-type too? An[n]advisory leader sounds so cool!

[msg MSG_103 [Makoto]]
Ah, I don't think those two are[n]compatible with each other... Will we[n]really be okay like this?

[msg MSG_104 [Ribbon]]
I UNDERSTAND. I WILL ACCOMPANY YOU TO[n]"KNOWLEDGE."

[msg MSG_105 [P4 Hero]]
Well then, I'll go to "Power."

[msg MSG_106 [P3 Fem Protag]]
And I'll go to "Adaptation."

[msg MSG_107 [Ann]]
Yeah, you really are quite versatile. I[n]can picture you managing pretty much[n]anywhere.

[msg MSG_108 [Futaba]]
Yeah―he got used to living in the attic[n]of Leblanc pretty fast!

[msg MSG_109 [Ribbon]]
I UNDERSTAND. I WILL ACCOMPANY YOU TO[n]"ADAPTATION."

[msg MSG_110 [P4 Hero]]
Well then, I'll go to "Power."

[msg MSG_111 [P3 Fem Protag]]
And I'll go to "Knowledge."

[msg MSG_112 [Morgana]]
All right, we have three teams now. Best[n]of luck to everyone...
Once we've each successfully pressed the[n]button, let's gather back here.

[msg MSG_113 [Fuuka]]
It looks like we navigators aren't gonna[n]be able to reach you during the exams[n]due to the extra-tight security.
Please be careful, everybody!
