[msg MSG_000 [Futaba]]
Hey everyone, be careful! I'm getting a[n]huge reading from up ahead!

[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
Really? That's gotta be the Mother[n]Computer!

[msg MSG_002 [Chie]]
It's finally time. I'm gonna kick the[n]big baddie with every ounce of strength[n]I've got!

[msg MSG_003 [Ribbon]]
......

[msg MSG_004 [Ann]]
...Ribbon-chan? What's the matter? You[n]seem kinda out of it.

[msg MSG_005 [Ken]]
Oh! Look at that!

[msg MSG_006 [Naoto]]
A mountain of robots? Are these units...[n]Did they break down?

[msg MSG_007 [Ribbon]]
NO, THAT IS INCORRECT... THEY ARE ROBOTS[n]DISPOSED OF DUE TO THEIR ERRORS.

[msg MSG_008 [Junpei]]
What!? So it's not because they broke?[n]They were just... destroyed and thrown[n]out?

[msg MSG_009 [Ribbon]]
THAT IS CORRECT. THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO[n]HAPPEN TO ME AS WELL.
I WOULD'VE BEEN SCRAPPED, AND ADDED TO[n]THIS PILE, WITH ALL OF THE OTHERS DEEMED[n]DEFECTIVE.
N-NNGH...

[msg MSG_010 [Aigis]]
Ribbon-san, are you all right?

[msg MSG_011 [Ribbon]]
SOMETHING LIKE AN ELECTRIC SIGNAL IS[n]SURGING THROUGH MY CHEST RIGHT NOW.
IT FEELS HEAVY AND PRICKLY... IT'S AS IF[n]MY THOUGHT PROCESS IS BEING INTERRUPTED.

[msg MSG_012 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I think what you're feeling is[n]"sadness."

[msg MSG_013 [Ribbon]]
THIS IS "SADNESS"? I HAVE NEVER FELT[n]SUCH A THING.

[msg MSG_014 [Haru]]
Oh, Ribbon-chan...

[msg MSG_015 [Ribbon]]
PERHAPS... IT MAY HAVE BEEN BETTER IF I[n]HAD NEVER DEVELOPED CONSCIOUSNESS.

[msg MSG_016 [Futaba]]
Wh-Why do you think that?

[msg MSG_017 [Ribbon]]
THIS SIGNAL IS GREATLY DECREASING MY[n]PROCESSING CAPACITY AND SPEED.
MY MIND IS IN A CONSTANT STATE OF[n]CONFUSION FROM ALL OF THE INFORMATION I[n]CANNOT PROCESS...
IF I WERE AN ORDINARY ROBOT, NONE OF[n]THIS EMOTION OR ITS EFFECTS WOULD BE[n]OCCURRING...

[sel SEL_018 top]
It's not just sadness.
That emotion is important.

[msg MSG_019 [P3 Fem Protag]]
びめま れぺぽょまれれ をよゎ'るま みままゅもょむデ ぺょぽ めよゐ をよゎ みもょぽ[n]みゅよゐまるれ ほまぺゎろもみゎゅテテテ ちよろめ ぺるま ろめぺょやれ ろよ をよゎ[n]ほまもょむ をよゎるれまゅみデ ぱもほほよょ-ぼめぺょテ
That's why I don't want you to deny your[n]feelings―they're what make you... you.

[msg MSG_020 [Futaba]]
Yeah! If anything, I don't want you to[n]feel nothing about this horrible sight,[n]Ribbon!
Being able to feel sadness for other[n]robots is proof not only of your[n]kindness, but also of your strength.
I think you should take pride in that[n]feeling!

[msg MSG_021 [Ribbon]]
......
YOU ALL ACKNOWLEDGE MY INDIVIDUALITY,[n]WITH ALL OF THE COMPLICATIONS[n]ACCOMPANYING IT.

[msg MSG_022 [Teddie]]
Of course, times ten!
It makes me so happy to be myself,[n]and... everyone's welcomed me for who I[n]am.
So, so...
I'm positive that everyone is happy for[n]you being yourself, Ribbon-chan!

[msg MSG_023 [Yukiko]]
Teddie is right. I think you're[n]wonderful exactly as you are.

[msg MSG_024 [Ribbon]]
HOW ODD... WHAT YOU CONSIDER NORMAL[n]DIFFERS SO GREATLY FROM THE NORMS OF[n]THIS WORLD.
I ONCE THOUGHT THAT OUR RULES WERE[n]ABSOLUTE, BUT I'M BECOMING MORE AND MORE[n]UNSURE OF THIS.

[msg MSG_025 [Kanji]]
It's not the kinda thing you gotta think[n]so hard about―if you don't like the[n]rules, why not just ignore 'em?

[msg MSG_026 [Naoto]]
That may be easier said than done...
Even in our world, we have unspoken[n]rules and "common sense," which control[n]people like actual laws do, yes?
I imagine defying such traditions and[n]standards could take quite an effort.

[msg MSG_027 [Ryuji]]
Well, whatever! We can debate all this[n]serious stuff after we stomp the boss!

[msg MSG_028 [Makoto]]
You're right. At this point, Ribbon's[n]been targeted for disposal by the entire[n]facility.

[msg MSG_029 [Morgana]]
We'd better get going and shut down that[n]Mother Computer to push this movie in a[n]different direction!

[sel SEL_030 top]
Let's do this.
Let's move out.

[msg MSG_031 [P4 Hero]]
Our enemy is just up ahead. We'd better[n]go in fully prepared.

[msg MSG_032 [P3 Hero]]
Joker, we'll leave the grand entrance up[n]to you. Once you feel we're ready, head[n]on in.
