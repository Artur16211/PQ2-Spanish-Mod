INITIATING SECURITY VERIFICATION...

[msg MSG_001 [Junpei]]
Whoa, what the―!?

[msg MSG_002 [Security system]]
UNIT TYPE VERIFIED... IW. MODEL NUMBER[n]VERIFIED... 02. CONFIRMING CLEARANCE[n]LEVEL...

[msg MSG_003 [Security system]]
ERROR. ONLY UNITS WITH ADMINISTRATIVE[n]CLEARANCE MAY ACCESS THIS AREA.
ACCESS DENIED. ESCALATING SECURITY[n]LEVEL. INITIATING SECURITY INTERCEPTION[n]PROTOCOL.

[msg MSG_004 [Junpei]]
Wait, what? "Administrative clearance"!?
What're we supposed to do? Have somebody[n]else get scanned?

[msg MSG_005 [Naoto]]
No... We'd all most likely end up with[n]the same results.

[msg MSG_006 [Yukari]]
This means we can't keep going unless we[n]have the clearance, right?
It said something about a unit type and[n]a model number...

[msg MSG_007 [Ribbon]]
THE UNIT TYPE IS THE SEQUENCE OF LETTERS[n]AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR IDENTIFICATION.
THIS IS DETERMINED BY THE FACTORY IN[n]WHICH YOU WERE CONSTRUCTED, AND DEPENDS[n]ON YOUR MODEL TYPE.
THEN, YOU ARE GIVEN A MODEL NUMBER.

[msg MSG_008 [Yusuke]]
I believe I was labeled as "TK-04."
So, for me, "TK" is the unit type and[n]"04" is the model number.

[msg MSG_009 [Yukiko]]
Mine was "YS-03."

[msg MSG_010 [Ribbon]]
NOW THAT I THINK OF IT, YOU ALL HAVE[n]DIFFERENT UNIT TYPES.
MASS-PRODUCED ROBOTS SUCH AS MYSELF TEND[n]TO HAVE THE SAME ONE...
BUT YOU ARE HUMAN. INCONSISTENCY IN[n]MODEL NUMBERS DEFIES LOGIC.

[msg MSG_011 [Yosuke]]
I mean, we might be human, but we're not[n]all the exact same person...

[msg MSG_012 [Teddie]]
Heheheh, this bear got assigned his own[n]individual number and everything!
I got "YS-07"!

[msg MSG_013 [Akechi]]
Hmm, it seems that the unit type is[n]designated based on our usual[n]associations.
We thieves are "TK," the Investigation[n]Team is "YS," and SEES is... Um...

[msg MSG_014 [Aigis]]
I am "IW-06." This indicates that our[n]unit type is "IW."

[msg MSG_015 [P3 Hero]]
I think I'm "IW-00."

[msg MSG_016 [Teddie]]
Hrmm? But wasn't "IW-00" assigned to the[n]fair lady here?

[msg MSG_017 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Y-Yeah... I think I'm "IW-00" too?

[msg MSG_018 [Ann]]
Wait, how does that make sense? Is it[n]possible for multiple people to have the[n]exact same identification?

[msg MSG_019 [Ribbon]]
NO, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE. THIS IS THE FIRST[n]CASE.

[msg MSG_020 [Yukari]]
Could it be because of that... parallel[n]universe thing?

[msg MSG_021 [Ribbon]]
THE SAME IDENTIFICATION... NORMALLY,[n]THEY WOULD BE TREATED AS ERRORS.

[msg MSG_022 [Futaba]]
Treated as errors, huh? ...Wait―an[n]error!
Ahhh, it just hit me! I got it! I think[n]we might be able to get past here!

[msg MSG_023 [Chie]]
Ooh, what? What is it?

[msg MSG_024 [Futaba]]
What would happen if these two―with the[n]same unit type and model number― went[n]through security at the same time?

[msg MSG_025 [Kanji]]
Well, Ribbon said their numbers ain't[n]possible, right? Sooo... wouldn't it[n]break the system?

[msg MSG_026 [Futaba]]

Ribbon said that this is a first, right?[n]Then let's use that to our advantage.

[msg MSG_027 [Fuuka]]
I see! While the system is locked up,[n]someone could slip by.

[msg MSG_028 [Futaba]]
Mweheheh... You noticed it too, huh,[n]Fuuka? That terminal over there?

[msg MSG_029 [Fuuka]]
Yes―whoever gets past the checkpoint[n]could use that terminal to shut down the[n]security in here.
But, the question is, who will go? It[n]may be too difficult for anyone who[n]isn't good with computers...

[sel SEL_030 top]
Go for it, Skull.
Go for it, Oracle.
Go for it, Aigis.
I've got this, everyone.

[msg MSG_033 [Ryuji]]
Uhhh... If all I had to do was run over[n]there, then sure, but...

[msg MSG_034 [Makoto]]
But we need someone who's capable of[n]bypassing the security system, too.

[msg MSG_035 [Aigis]]
I will do this.

[msg MSG_036 [Futaba]]
N-No way! You expect some kinda[n]acrobatic miracle―from me!?

[msg MSG_037 [Makoto]]
Hmm. If we need someone who can move[n]quickly enough and can also bypass the[n]security system...

[msg MSG_038 [Aigis]]
I will do it.

[msg MSG_039 [Aigis]]
Understood. I will do this.

[msg MSG_040 [Ryuji]]
Ooh, nothin' to worry about if Joker's[n]on it! You good to go, bro?

[msg MSG_041 [Makoto]]
Wait...

[msg MSG_042 [Aigis]]
Then, I will do this.

[msg MSG_043 [P3 Hero]]
...You sure, Aigis?

[msg MSG_044 [Aigis]]
If I were to gain direct access to the[n]terminal, bypassing the security[n]protocol will be a breeze.

[msg MSG_045 [Futaba]]
Ooh, that's a good point. My vote's for[n]Aigis!
So, Joker―whaddaya say?

[sel SEL_046 top]
You're right.
Just be careful, Aigis.

[msg MSG_047 [Aigis]]
I understand. Now, I must ask you two to[n]move into position so that we may[n]commence the operation.

[msg MSG_048 [P3 Hero]]
Okay. All we have to do is walk through[n]there at the same time, right?

[msg MSG_049 [Futaba]]
Hey, if anything goes wrong―anything at[n]all―make sure you run for it, okay?[n]Attacking will be our last resort!

[msg MSG_050 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Well then, here goes. Please, please[n]work...

[msg MSG_051 [Security system]]
UNIT TYPE VERIFIED... IW. MODEL[n]NUMBER...

[msg MSG_053 [Futaba]]
There it goes―now!

[msg MSG_054 [Aigis]]
I am going!

[msg MSG_055 [Aigis]]
I have arrived―now deactivating the[n]security system.

[msg MSG_056 [Futaba]]
Yes! We did it!

[msg MSG_057 [P3 Hero]]
Well... Looks like it turned out just[n]fine. That was a bit scary, though.

[msg MSG_058 [Ryuji]]
The good news is, we can keep goin' now!

[msg MSG_059 [P3 Fem Protag]]
He and I are errors, huh...?

[msg MSG_060 [Aigis]]
-san, what is the matter?

[msg MSG_061 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hm? Oh, no―it's nothing!
More importantly, you were so fast![n]That's the Aigis I know!

[msg MSG_062 [Aigis]]
Yes, the operation was successful. No[n]complications whatsoever.

[msg MSG_063 [Fuuka]]
Everyone, be extra careful moving[n]forward!
