[msg MSG_000 [Aigis]]
Thank you for tending to me earlier.

[msg MSG_001 [Hikari]]
Aigis-san... You're going with everyone[n]too?

[msg MSG_002 [Aigis]]
Of course. I shall fight alongside[n]everyone as well.

[msg MSG_003 [Hikari]]
B-But... what if you get hurt again,[n]like before?

[msg MSG_004 [P3 Hero]]
It's kind of you to be worried about[n]Aigis. Thanks.

[msg MSG_005 [Aigis]]
As you can see, I am fully recovered. I[n]can resume my duties at this time.

[msg MSG_006 [P3 Hero]]
Then, can you go on ahead and prep with[n]everyone else? I'll be right there.

[msg MSG_007 [Aigis]]
Understood.

[msg MSG_008 [Hikari]]
......

[msg MSG_009 [Hikari]]
-kun, you're the leader of Aigis-san,[n]Koro-chan, and the others, right?

[msg MSG_010 [P3 Hero]]
Yeah, that's right.

[msg MSG_011 [Hikari]]
Isn't it hard to keep them all together?

[msg MSG_012 [P3 Hero]]
Hmm... Not really? It's actually pretty[n]fun.

[msg MSG_013 [Hikari]]
But, everyone's got such unique[n]personalities... They're not really the[n]norm, are they?

[msg MSG_014 [P3 Hero]]
The norm... I wonder what normal[n]actually is.

[msg MSG_015 [Hikari]]
Huh?

[msg MSG_016 [P3 Hero]]
My companions are a bit―no, a lot, I[n]guess―all unique in their own way...
But that's never bothered me. It's only[n]natural for everyone to be different.

[msg MSG_017 [Hikari]]
But, if you're different from everyone[n]else... they look at you like you're[n]weird.

[msg MSG_018 [P3 Hero]]
I don't think you should change yourself[n]for someone else if they don't accept[n]you for who you really are.
There are always people out there who'll[n]accept you, even when you're different[n]from them.

[msg MSG_019 [Hikari]]
But... still, I...
...I'm sorry.

[msg MSG_020 [Junpei]]
Hey, c'mon! Let's get back in that[n]movie!

[msg MSG_021 [Aigis]]
We are all waiting for you.

[msg MSG_022 [Teddie]]
Yosuke says we're gonna leave you behind[n]if you don't hurry!

[msg MSG_023 [Yosuke]]
I did not!

[msg MSG_024 [P3 Hero]]
Okay, be right there.

[msg MSG_025 [P3 Hero]]
I can't find the exact words for what I[n]mean...
But, we're going to change that movie.[n]Once you've seen the ending... let's[n]talk again.

[msg MSG_026 [Hikari]]
Mm, I understand... Be careful in there.
