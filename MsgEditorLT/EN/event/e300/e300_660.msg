Hey, what's happened!?

[msg MSG_001 [Nagi]]
Everyone―Hikari-san's been kidnapped by[n]Doe!

[msg MSG_002 [Futaba]]
She got kidnapped!? Wh-What are you[n]talking about!?

[msg MSG_003 [Fuuka]]
Hikari-chan was watching the end of the[n]movie right here with us.

[msg MSG_004 [Rise]]
Then, Doe came and spit out the third[n]key.
Fuuka-chan went to pick it up, and I was[n]trying to contact you guys to tell you[n]about it.

[msg MSG_005 [Fuuka]]
We looked away for just a moment... and[n]Doe took Hikari-chan away!

[msg MSG_006 [Ryuji]]
Dammit... That spongy sack of shit!

[msg MSG_007 [Nagi]]
I deeply apologize for this. It happened[n]when I had stepped away to address[n]another matter...
I searched everywhere immediately upon[n]hearing what happened, but she's nowhere[n]to be found...

[msg MSG_008 [Naoto]]
To think Doe would do such a thing... We[n]had left our guard down ourselves.
And on top of that, Doe's true identity[n]has remained a mystery all this time...

[sel SEL_009 top]
He must be our enemy.
He's Hikari's stalker.
He's a mischievous mascot.

[msg MSG_010 [Akechi]]
If Hikari-san's been kidnapped, then[n]that seems like a strong possibility at[n]this point...
But none of us felt a shred of malice[n]from him until now, and that especially[n]bothers me.

[msg MSG_011 [Yukiko]]
Now that I think about it, he was[n]staring at Hikari-chan a little too[n]much, and...
That type of look isn't normal at all.

[msg MSG_012 [Akechi]]
True, he did seem to have some sort of[n]fixation with her.

[msg MSG_013 [Teddie]]
If he wants to be a mascot, he needs to[n]be adorably mischievous like me, not[n]some... some ruffian!
He was disqualified from being a mascot[n]the moment he kidnapped Hikarin!

[msg MSG_014 [Futaba]]
But... But I... did my best...
S-So, why!? The movie turned out so[n]nice, too!

[msg MSG_015 [Aigis]]
Futaba-san...

[msg MSG_016 [Futaba]]
All I wanted was to show Hikari a nice[n]movie!
One that shows her individuality isn't[n]bad... That it's actually a good thing!

[msg MSG_017 [Yusuke]]
Futaba... I can understand how you feel,[n]but you should try to calm down.

[msg MSG_018 [P4 Hero]]
He's right. It's frightening, but we[n]need to keep our wits about us now more[n]than ever.

[msg MSG_019 [Rise]]
Um, let me give you guys this...

[msg MSG_020 [Akechi]]
The key to the third lock... Let's go[n]work on our escape route.

[msg MSG_021 [Ryuji]]
But―You're just gonna leave Hikari to[n]Doe!?

[msg MSG_022 [Akechi]]
Well, we do have quite a sizable group.[n]Why don't we allocate different tasks?

[msg MSG_023 [Shinjiro]]
...He's got a point. Runnin' around in[n]one big pack won't do us much good.

[msg MSG_024 [Chie]]
Okay―we'll go look for Hikari-chan!
Can you and your friends go and open the[n]lock, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]-kun?

[sel SEL_025 top]
Alright.
I don't really feel up for it...

[msg MSG_026 [Ann]]
Hey! No griping!

[msg MSG_027 [Akihiko]]
We'll go search around the theater too.[n]Good luck with the lock.

[msg MSG_028 [P4 Hero]]
Okay, let's meet up right here in a[n]little bit.

[msg MSG_029 [Morgana]]
Come on, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]―let's go check out the[n]locks.
