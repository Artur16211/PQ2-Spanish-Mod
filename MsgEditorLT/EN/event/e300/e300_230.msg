[msg MSG_000 [Yukiko]]
Oh... It's stopped moving.

[msg MSG_001 [Yukari]]
Hey, are we gonna be okay? It's so dark,[n]I can't see a thing!

[msg MSG_002 [Exam system AI]]
UNITS TK-00, 02, 04, 07. UNIT YS-03.
UNITS IW-01, 07, 08. UNIT UIY-2249.
BEGINNING THE "ADAPTATION" TEST.

[msg MSG_003 [Yusuke]]
This doesn't seem to be a trap, but what[n]exactly do they intend for us to do in[n]this darkness?

[msg MSG_004 [Haru]]
Huh? There's a metal beam spanning over[n]some massive blast furnace...

[msg MSG_004_1 [Haru]]
And on the other side... Is that a[n]drawbridge?

[msg MSG_005 [Exam system AI]]
BEFORE YOU IS A BALANCE BEAM.
THE DESIGNATED EXTREME CONDITION FOR[n]TODAY'S ADAPTATION EXAM IS "HEIGHTS."
IF YOU CANNOT ADAPT TO THIS DIFFICULT[n]WALKING SURFACE, YOU WILL BE DISPOSED OF[n]IMMEDIATELY.

[msg MSG_006 [Ann]]
Wait―"disposed of "!?

[msg MSG_007 [Ken]]
Well, if we can't adapt, we'll end up in[n]the blast furnace―that sure is one way[n]to dispose of something...

[msg MSG_008 [Ribbon]]
THAT IS HOW DISPOSAL WORKS HERE. ANY[n]ROBOT WITH A FATAL ERROR IS IMMEDIATELY[n]SCRAPPED.

[msg MSG_009 [Exam system AI]]
NOTE: COOPERATION IS REQUIRED IN THIS[n]TEST. IF A TASK IS FAILED, ALL WILL FACE[n]THE CONSEQUENCES.
EACH UNIT WILL BE CONSIDERED CRITICALLY[n]ERRONEOUS AND DISPOSED OF[n]SIMULTANEOUSLY.
WE SHALL NOW BEGIN THE EXAM.

[msg MSG_010 [Yukiko]]
So this is what they mean by adaptation.[n]We don't have any choice but to cross[n]this beam, do we?

[sel SEL_011 top]
This is scary...
This'll be a piece of cake.
I love heights.

[msg MSG_012 [Yusuke]]
Hm―even our oft-fearless Joker is[n]frightened by this.

[msg MSG_013 [Ann]]
What's so funny, Fox? You have to cross[n]it too, y'know.

[msg MSG_014 [Ken]]
Really? No wonder you're a phantom[n]thief!

[msg MSG_015 [Ann]]
Uh, this exam has nothing to do with[n]being a phantom thief! Don't raise the[n]bar TOO high there!

[msg MSG_016 [Yusuke]]
Yes, being close to the sky elates me as[n]well. It also affords one great views at[n]times.

[msg MSG_017 [Ann]]
Oh, right... All I can see from here is[n]a toasty end.

[msg MSG_018 [Yukari]]
You know, they might call this test an[n]"adaptation exam" for robots...
But isn't this more like a life-or-death[n]test of guts for people like us?

[msg MSG_019 [Yukiko]]
How should we cross this? It'd be easier[n]to imagine if we could watch an example.

[msg MSG_020 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_021 [Ken]]
Ah―Koromaru!?

[msg MSG_022 [Yukari]]
Wow... He made it across so fast!

[msg MSG_023 [Koromaru]]
Bark bark!

[msg MSG_024 [Ribbon]]
HE SAID, "IT WILL BE ALRIGHT, EVERYONE.[n]JUST FOLLOW MY LEAD."

[msg MSG_025 [Ken]]
Wow, Koromaru! You've really got guts.
But... I don't think we can copy his[n]method of getting across too easily.

[msg MSG_026 [Ann]]
Yeah, it'd be easier to imagine if we[n]could watch a HUMAN example.

[msg MSG_027 [Yusuke]]
In that case, we'll leave it to our[n]leader.

[msg MSG_028 [Yusuke]]
Show us the way, Joker!

[sel SEL_029 top]
I'm going to crush this.
Collect my ashes if I fall.

[msg MSG_030 [Yusuke]]
I doubt even ashes would remain if you[n]were to fall... No, I must accept your[n]final request!

[msg MSG_031]
It seems that my time has come...

[msg MSG_032 [Ken]]
Oh wow, I can't believe he's walking[n]across that so confidently! No wonder[n]he's leader of the Phantom Thieves!

[msg MSG_033 [Yukari]]
His balance is so perfect―even at that[n]speed...

[msg MSG_034]
I made my way across the beam...

[msg MSG_035 [Yukiko]]
You did it, Joker! I'm starting to feel[n]like I can do this too.

[msg MSG_036 [Ribbon]]
THAT WAS A VITAL SAMPLE YOU PROVIDED. I[n]HAVE CALCULATED THE SAFEST ROUTE FOR[n]CROSSING.

[msg MSG_037 [Yukari]]
What do you mean the safest route? Isn't[n]there just the one beam!?

[msg MSG_038 [Haru]]
There she goes... I wonder if she'll be[n]okay.

[msg MSG_039 [Yusuke]]
She did say she found the safest route.[n]I doubt she would fall after such[n]calculations.

[msg MSG_040 [Ken]]
Uh, it looks like she's just going[n]across the center of the beam like[n]normal...

[msg MSG_041 [Ann]]
Oh, she made it!
Sooo... Who's next?

[msg MSG_042 [Haru]]
May I go? I think I could do a good job[n]copying their approach.
I just need to channel my ballet skills[n]here, and... Hup!

[msg MSG_043 [Yusuke]]
Oh, my―she's downright majestic. Just[n]look at her perfect form...

[msg MSG_044 [Yukiko]]
Yeah, she made it across without a[n]hitch. Well, I think I'll go next.
I bet this'll be easy if I just think of[n]the steel beam as the edge of a tatami[n]mat.

[msg MSG_045 [Yukari]]
What do those even have to do with each[n]othe―Wait! Oh, she's already crossing...

[msg MSG_046 [Ann]]
Yukiko-chan's got some real guts too!

[msg MSG_047 [Yusuke]]
Her appearance from behind as she[n]crosses, life on the line, is a marvel[n]to behold! It's stirred my very soul!
Ha... In that case, I should go next. I[n]shall embody beauty itself with my[n]technique!

[sel SEL_048 top]
Can it, Fox―just get over here.
Mesmerize us all, Fox.

[msg MSG_049 [Yusuke]]
Understood. Burn my image into your[n]retinas.

[msg MSG_050]
Fox began crossing the steel beam...
He's swaying wildly now...

[msg MSG_051 [Ann]]
Doesn't his approach seem kinda...[n]extremely dangerous?

[msg MSG_052 [Yukari]]
Yeah, that wobbling makes it look like[n]he's about to fall... Whether he does or[n]not, it doesn't look good.

[msg MSG_053 [Yusuke]]
Aah―!

[msg MSG_054 [Ann]]
Fox!

[msg MSG_055 [Yusuke]]
Haaa!

[msg MSG_056 [Yukari]]
Uh, what's he doing? Is he... really[n]risking his life on a gag!? Am I[n]supposed to laugh, or...

[msg MSG_057 [Yusuke]]
THIS is the golden ratio of balance!

[msg MSG_058 [Ann]]
Sheesh, don't scare us like that, Fox![n]Anyways... he's across now.

[msg MSG_059 [Yukari]]
We're down to just the three of us.[n]Who's going next?

[msg MSG_060 [Ann]]
This is the kind of thing that gets more[n]nerve-wracking the longer you hold[n]out... Should we all just go at once?

[msg MSG_061 [Yukari]]
Hey, great idea! Do you wanna take the[n]lead, Panther?

[msg MSG_062 [Ann]]
I'd, uh, prefer being in the center...[n]or something.

[msg MSG_063 [Ken]]
Then, I'll take the lead. Please, follow[n]me.

[msg MSG_064 [Yukari]]
You wanna go first, Ken-kun!?

[msg MSG_065 [Ken]]
I-I know I can do it! I'll be fine... as[n]long as I don't look down.

[msg MSG_066 [Ann]]
We can go slowly, right!? And it's[n]scary, so maybe I should close my eyes―

[msg MSG_067 [Yukari]]
No, don't do that! Just concentrate on[n]the beam and not the floor!

[msg MSG_068 [Ann]]
Oh crap, my legs are shaking...

[msg MSG_069 [Ken]]
Only a little more! Don't think about[n]it, just keep moving!

[msg MSG_070 [Ann]]
Ah, we finally made it... I was sweating[n]bullets.

[msg MSG_071 [Haru]]
Thank goodness. Well done, you three!

[msg MSG_072 [Yukari]]
Whew... I feel like I managed to force[n]myself across that beam thanks to[n]Ken-kun leading the way.

[msg MSG_073 [Ken]]
Actually, I was pretty scared too...[n]But, did I at least prove that I can[n]step up when the going gets tough?

[sel SEL_074 top]
You did great.
You could be a phantom thief.

[msg MSG_075 [Ken]]
Heheh... Then again, all I did was[n]follow your lead.

[msg MSG_076 [Ann]]
Still, you were great out there,[n]Ken-kun. Nice job!

[msg MSG_077 [Koromaru]]
Arf arf!

[msg MSG_078 [Ann]]
Mmhm, we'd gladly welcome you on the[n]team, Ken-kun.

[msg MSG_079 [Ken]]
Really!? Heheh, a phantom thief, huh...[n]Awesome!

[msg MSG_080 [Koromaru]]
Arf arf!

[msg MSG_081 [Exam system AI]]
ONTO THE NEXT SECTION.

[msg MSG_082 [Haru]]
Oh―it's not over yet, eh?

[msg MSG_083 [Exam system AI]]
NEXT, YOU MUST CROSS THE BEAM IN UNDER 3[n]MINUTES. ALL UNITS MUST CROSS[n]SIMULTANEOUSLY.
IF ANY UNIT FALLS, ALL UNITS WILL BE[n]DISPOSED OF DUE TO COLLECTIVE[n]RESPONSIBILITY.

[msg MSG_084 [Yukari]]
What!? You can't be serious! We've gotta[n]go all together AND in three minutes!?

[msg MSG_085 [Yukiko]]
Oh, another beam just appeared!

[msg MSG_086 [Exam system AI]]
THE TIMER IS SET. COMMENCING THE SECOND[n]SECTION OF THE EXAM...

[msg MSG_087 [Ann]]
Hey, wait a sec―already!?

[msg MSG_088 [Yusuke]]
We don't have the time to mull over[n]strategies―let's follow Joker's lead.

[msg MSG_089 [Haru]]
Make sure you don't look down. Everyone,[n]look straight ahead!

[msg MSG_090 [Yukari]]
It's okay, I can do this... I just did[n]this a second ago, so...

[msg MSG_091 [Exam system AI]]
1 MINUTE REMAINING.

[msg MSG_092 [Ken]]
What do we do? If we don't hurry up,[n]we're not gonna make it!

[msg MSG_093 [Yukiko]]
Wha―!? I tripped...

[msg MSG_094 [Haru]]
Whoa, I'm slipping!

[msg MSG_095 [Yukari]]
Oh crap, I'm gonna fall!

[msg MSG_096 [Ann]]
Aah, someone save me! Help!

[sel SEL_097 top]
Reach out to Yukiko
Reach out to Yukari
Reach out to Panther
Reach out to Noir

[msg MSG_098 [Yukiko]]
Huh? Oh... Thank you.

[msg MSG_098_5 [Yukiko]]
Oh―!

[msg MSG_099 [Yukari]]
Ah, thank you! Big help!

[msg MSG_099_5 [Yukari]]
Wait, what the―!?

[msg MSG_100 [Ann]]
Joker! Thanks, that makes me so happy!

[msg MSG_100_5 [Ann]]
Wait, ah―!

[msg MSG_101 [Haru]]
Huh? Joker!? Thank you, I'll hold onto[n]you.

[msg MSG_101_5 [Haru]]
Wait, what―!?

[msg MSG_102 [Yusuke]]
Whoops. Sorry, Joker!

[msg MSG_103]
Fox is tightly clinging to me...

[msg MSG_104 [Yusuke]]
Thanks to your reaching out to me, I[n]managed to regain my balance. I'm ever[n]so grateful.

[msg MSG_105 [Yukiko]]
......

[msg MSG_106 [Yukari]]
......

[msg MSG_107 [Ann]]
......

[msg MSG_108 [Haru]]
......

[msg MSG_109 [Ken]]
Oh, look! We've almost made it!

[msg MSG_110 [Yusuke]]
Splendid―let's make a dash for the[n]finish line!
...Hey, Joker, what's keeping you?

[msg MSG_111 [Ann]]
He can't run―he's got a Fox stuck on[n]him.

[msg MSG_112 [Yusuke]]
Ah, yes. Excuse me.

[msg MSG_113 [Haru]]
The security release switch should be up[n]ahead. Let's get going!

[msg MSG_114 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_115]
Meanwhile, in the "Power" exam room...

[msg MSG_116 [P4 Hero]]
Now that I think about it, wouldn't this[n]be easier if we just put ourselves on[n]the scale?

[msg MSG_117 [Teddie]]
Now that's our Sensei for you! I've been[n]thinking the same thing this entire[n]time!

[msg MSG_118 [Ryuji]]
Don't gimme that bullshit! You looked[n]like you were wetting your suit until[n]like three seconds ago!

[msg MSG_119 [Akihiko]]
Heh... That's pretty good.

[msg MSG_120 [Shinjiro]]
Hey, quit wastin' time chuckling at[n]frivolous shit and line up for the[n]scale!

[msg MSG_121 [Chie]]
Ah―Hang on! Can we, uh... not hop on[n]there one at a time? Please!?

[msg MSG_122]
Meanwhile, in the "Knowledge" exam[n]room...

[msg MSG_123 [Makoto]]
Excellent, Mona, another right answer.[n]You're the last one, Hanamura-kun.

[msg MSG_124 [Yosuke]]
R-Right... Time to flex my skills as[n]chief of operations!

[msg MSG_125 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Just calm down, Yosuke-kun. You'll be[n]fine if you think it through.

[msg MSG_126 [Naoto]]
-san's right―focus on maintaining your[n]cool.

[msg MSG_127 [P3 Fem Protag]]
If it comes down to it, we'll be here to[n]help you out, so stay confident!

[msg MSG_128 [Morgana]]
Ah... She's quite good at this, isn't[n]she?

[msg MSG_129 [Mitsuru]]
Yes, she's holding us together well. I[n]can tell she's a natural leader.
