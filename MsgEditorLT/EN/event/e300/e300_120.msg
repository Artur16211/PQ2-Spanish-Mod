[msg MSG_000 [Yukari]]
Whew! This place is massive. It feels[n]like we've still got a long ways to go,[n]too...

[msg MSG_001 [Akihiko]]
What, tired already?

[msg MSG_002 [Yukari]]
Nah, it's more of a mental thing.[n]Exploring an unfamiliar place like this[n]can get exhausting...
But, I can definitely keep going!

[msg MSG_003 [Makoto]]
That raises a good point, though―we have[n]quite a few members who are new to our[n]process. We shouldn't overdo it.
Let's take periodic breaks as we[n]proceed. This would all be pointless if[n]we drove ourselves to exhaustion.

[msg MSG_004 [Mitsuru]]
So, I've grown curious about you Phantom[n]Thieves―does your attire not weigh you[n]down?

[msg MSG_005 [Ken]]
I've been wondering about that too...
Parts of your costume, like the cape and[n]the spikes, look so heavy―but you move[n]around so quickly.

[msg MSG_006 [Junpei]]
Ooh, are we really going there?
Cuz I wanna know too! What are the[n]secrets behind your clothes?

[sel SEL_007 top]
It's a long story...
That's just how they're spec'd.

[msg MSG_008 [Makoto]]
True, it is rather difficult to[n]explain...

[msg MSG_009 [Futaba]]
It's just how they're spec'd. Done.

[msg MSG_010 [Ann]]
Heheh... If only I had a better[n]explanation for it...

[msg MSG_011 [Yukiko]]
I think they're great. Everyone's attire[n]is really stylish, and suits them well.

[msg MSG_012 [Akechi]]
Yes, our personalities are expressed[n]quite clearly through them. I actually[n]like mine quite a bit.

[msg MSG_013 [Yukiko]]
Crow, your mask looks like it does a[n]good job guarding your nose.

[msg MSG_014 [Chie]]
That's true, but wouldn't it poke anyone[n]standing in front of him in the head?

[msg MSG_015 [Yukiko]]
That just means it has solid offense and[n]defense. When you consider that, I'd bet[n]it's even better than gag glasses.

[msg MSG_016 [Akechi]]
Haha―thank you for the... praise, I[n]guess?

[msg MSG_017 [Yukari]]
And, how about what you guys call each[n]other, like Joker and Mona? Are they[n]nicknames?

[sel SEL_018 top]
They're our codenames.
They're our spirit names.

[msg MSG_019 [Morgana]]
That's right.

[msg MSG_020 [Morgana]]
C'mon! They're codenames!

[msg MSG_021 [Ken]]
Codenames... How do you pick those?

[msg MSG_022 [Futaba]]
It's mostly based on how our outfits[n]look or make us feel. Do you guys want[n]some too?

[msg MSG_023 [Junpei]]
Aw, yeah! I was just thinking it's about[n]time for me to take up a title!

[msg MSG_024 [Akihiko]]
So, they're like ring names... That[n]doesn't sound half bad. I'll take one[n]too, if you don't mind.

[msg MSG_025 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_026 [Naoto]]
Didn't we already learn where this kind[n]of conversation leads us...?

[msg MSG_027 [Ann]]
C'mon, it'll be fun. You gotta go with[n]the flow!
So, if we base it off how Sanada-san[n]looks, maybe... Boxer?

[msg MSG_028 [Yukari]]
Isn't that kinda straightforward? The[n]first codename that comes to my mind for[n]him is Protein...

[msg MSG_029 [Shinjiro]]
Yeah, just go with that. He even loves[n]dumping protein powder on his rice.

[msg MSG_030 [Akihiko]]
Give me a break! Can you even think of a[n]codename for me that doesn't have to do[n]with protein, Shinji?

[msg MSG_031 [Shinjiro]]
Even if I took the time to think one up,[n]you'd still just go on and on about[n]protein anyway! Why should I bother?

[msg MSG_032 [Akihiko]]
Wha―Don't make it sound like that's the[n]only thing I talk about!
I'm only so particular about protein[n]because it's the primary nutrient that[n]the body needs to―

[msg MSG_033 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Okay, so Akihiko-senpai is Protein!
Now, how about Miss Pink for Yukari?

[msg MSG_034 [Yukari]]
Huh? I'm getting one too!?

[msg MSG_035 [Yosuke]]
Ooh, that's spot-on! It's got that air[n]of authority to it, but it sounds cute,[n]too!

[msg MSG_036 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Right? Plus, her outfits and accessories[n]are overwhelmingly pink.

[msg MSG_037 [Yukari]]
Hey, how'd you know that!?
Oh, right―you already know me. I[n]forgot... Sorry.

[msg MSG_038 [Ken]]
U-Um... Can Koromaru and I get codenames[n]too?

[msg MSG_039 [Haru]]
Amada-kun is a spear wielder, so[n]perhaps... Lancer? Is that too plain?

[msg MSG_040 [P3 Fem Protag]]
If Yukari's Miss Pink, then how about[n]Mister Black for Ken-kun?

[msg MSG_041 [Ken]]
Mister Black... Not bad.
Even in Featherman, Black is depicted as[n]a cool, "lone wolf" type with a high[n]level of maturity...

[msg MSG_042 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Plus, you're always trying so hard to[n]make yourself like black coffee!

[msg MSG_043 [Ken]]
Huh? You even know that!?

[msg MSG_044 [Koromaru]]
Arf, arf!

[msg MSG_045 [Yusuke]]
Let's see... For Koromaru, how about,[n]Hellbeast Summoned from the Infernal[n]Depths!?

[msg MSG_046 [Koromaru]]
*whine*

[msg MSG_047 [Futaba]]
Looks like your names are a little too[n]next-level for the dog scene, Inari.

[msg MSG_048 [Junpei]]
Alright, me next, me next! So, what kind[n]of codename do you think fits me best?

[sel SEL_049 top]
Goatee.
Geezer.
Ace Detective.

[msg MSG_050 [Junpei]]
Is that all you see me as!?

[msg MSG_051 [Yukiko]]
That's way too obvious... Snrk―[n]Heehee... Aha, ahahahaha!

[msg MSG_052 [Haru]]
*giggle* Come now... It's rude to laugh[n]at that, Yukiko-chan... *giggle*

[msg MSG_053 [Kanji]]
You two are havin' too much fun with[n]this...

[msg MSG_054 [Morgana]]
Yup.

[msg MSG_055 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Junpei's not a geezer. He's just a high-[n]schooler who only looks exactly like a[n]geezer!

[msg MSG_056 [Junpei]]
You're not helping! If anything, you[n]went in for the kill...

[msg MSG_057 [Junpei]]
Oho, you know me too well!
But, shortening that to Ace sounds a lot[n]cooler and fitting, amirite? Let's[n]shorten it.

[msg MSG_058 [Futaba]]
Then we'll shorten it―to Geezer.

[msg MSG_059 [Junpei]]
How did THAT happen!?

[msg MSG_060 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Now, for Shinjiro-senpai's codename...[n]How about Brood?

[msg MSG_061 [Shinjiro]]
Huh!? Are you sayin' I'm moody or[n]somethin'?

[msg MSG_062 [P3 Fem Protag]]
No, it's not that! You take such good[n]care of us―especially Koromaru! So,[n]you're sort of like our brood mother...

[msg MSG_063 [Shinjiro]]
Wha―You―What're you...!?

[msg MSG_064 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_065 [Shinjiro]]
Don't take HER side, Koro-cha―[n]Ahem―Koromaru!

[msg MSG_066 [Ryuji]]
So, the guy loves dogs, but he keeps it[n]a secret, huh...?

[msg MSG_067 [Fuuka]]
You really know everyone so well,-chan.[n]It's amazing!

[msg MSG_068 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I know all about you too, Fuuka. Let's[n]see, Fuuka's codename...
Maybe Hacker? Or, Killer Chef?

[msg MSG_069 [Futaba]]
But "hacker" is my deal too.

[msg MSG_070 [Yosuke]]
Oh―in that case, "killer chef" is the[n]deal for the girls on our team, too.

[msg MSG_071 [Chie]]
EXCUSE me!?

[msg MSG_072 [Fuuka]]
Oh... So, the me in your world isn't[n]that great at cooking either...

[msg MSG_073 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Uhhh, not great isn't quite the idea...[n]It's more like, it could result in a[n]murder investigation?

[msg MSG_074 [Yukari]]
You're being way too honest right now.

[msg MSG_075 [Junpei]]
But, wow! I guess we really are pretty[n]much the same in your world, huh?

[msg MSG_076 [Mitsuru]]
All right everyone, I believe that's[n]enough chatting. We should get going[n]and―

[msg MSG_077 [Junpei]]
Oh! We don't have one for Mitsuru-senpai[n]yet. Got anything,?

[msg MSG_078 [P3 Fem Protag]]
C'est Magnifique... No, that's more of a[n]phrase than a codename. Oh! How about[n]Execution Queen?

[msg MSG_079 [Mitsuru]]
What!?

[msg MSG_080 [Yukari]]
Oh, you're right... Mitsuru-senpai does[n]say "execute" a lot.

[msg MSG_081 [Mitsuru]]
Please, stop this...

[msg MSG_082 [Akihiko]]
Anyway―you really do know us well, don't[n]you, [f 6 1 27 0 0 0]?
Even I'm starting to feel like she's[n]always been a part of our group.

[msg MSG_083 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Yeah... I'm surprised too.
Everyone here is exactly like the[n]companions that I know...

[msg MSG_084 [Junpei]]
Then, should we give you a codename too,[n][f 6 1 27 0 0 0]?

[msg MSG_085 [P3 Fem Protag]]
...Huh?

[msg MSG_086 [Junpei]]
I mean, I don't really know what it'd[n]be, but we shouldn't leave you out as[n]the only person without one!
Hey, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]―can you come up with a[n]codename for [f 6 1 27 0 0 0]?

[sel SEL_087 top]
Headphones.
Spunky.
Dazzling Demon.

[msg MSG_088 [Futaba]]
But, Yosuke and I have headphones too.[n]Wouldn't that be confusing?

[msg MSG_089 [Fuuka]]
Oh, our own leader wears headphones as[n]well.

[msg MSG_090 [Yosuke]]
If someone called out, "Headphones!" and[n]all four of us turned around, it'd be[n]like some kind of skit...

[msg MSG_091 [Ann]]
True, she's always so bright and cheery.[n]Just being around her lifts our spirits.

[msg MSG_092 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Eh? Really? Ahaha, that's[n]embarrassing...

[msg MSG_093 [Futaba]]
She's like some kind of social goddess.[n]She's so full of energy that it's[n]honestly blinding to someone like me.

[msg MSG_094 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Dazzling Demon...

[msg MSG_095 [Akechi]]
Calling a lady a demon is a bit over the[n]line, don't you think?

[msg MSG_096 [P3 Fem Protag]]
That is so cool and scary! I love it!

[msg MSG_097 [Akechi]]
Wha... She likes it!?

[msg MSG_098 [Mitsuru]]
Good heavens... Is everyone satisfied[n]now?
Enough playing around―it's time for us[n]to get moving again.

[msg MSG_099 [Junpei]]
Aww, but what about our codenames?

[msg MSG_100 [Mitsuru]]
There's no real reason for us to use[n]codenames.
In fact, any confusing names could cause[n]problems when issuing commands.

[msg MSG_101 [Ken]]
Yeah, I guess that's true... It just[n]feels like a bit of a bummer, though.

[msg MSG_102 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Still, it made me so happy that you[n]wanted to give me a codename too...[n]Thank you.

[msg MSG_103 [Yukari]]
Oh, it wasn't any big deal, but if you[n]like it, uh... You're welcome, I guess?

[msg MSG_104 [Morgana]]
Looks like this was a useful rest for[n]everybody. Well then, let's head out.
