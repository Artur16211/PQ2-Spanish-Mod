Inside the air duct...

[msg MSG_001 [Ken]]
I-It's much darker in here than I[n]thought. I can't see anything in front[n]of me at all...

[msg MSG_002 [P3 Hero]]
To think we'd sneak through a tiny duct[n]like this... This is a pretty rare[n]experience.

[msg MSG_003 [P4 Hero]]
It may be a bit presumptuous of me, but[n]this really makes me feel like we're[n]phantom thieves!

[sel SEL_004 top]
This is pretty exhilarating.
This isn't all that common for us.

[msg MSG_005 [Futaba]]
C'mon, you're always doing this kinda[n]stuff, Joker.

[msg MSG_006 [P3 Hero]]
Is that so? I thought this was your[n]usual kind of thing.

[msg MSG_007 [Futaba]]
Yeah, we do this all the time. It's to[n]the point that we could be called Duct[n]Masters.

[msg MSG_008 [Naoto]]
It truly is pitch black in this duct,[n]though... It'd be a big help if we had[n]some kind of light source.

[msg MSG_009 [Ann]]
Hmm, some kind of light source... Got[n]any bright ideas, Joker?

[sel SEL_010 top]
Oracle's goggles.
What about Aigis' functions?
Use your fire, Panther.

[msg MSG_011 [Futaba]]
I only have the one pair. And,[n]unfortunately, they're designed[n]specifically for me...
But I'll let you know if I find anything[n]useful.

[msg MSG_012 [Yukiko]]
Ooh, do your eyes shine like headlights?

[msg MSG_013 [Aigis]]
I apologize―I lack any form of headlight[n]function.

[msg MSG_014 [Naoto]]
Wait, wait, wait! We can't use fire in[n]an enclosed space like this!

[msg MSG_015 [Yukiko]]
Will her fire be enough, though? I can[n]help out if you need it...

[msg MSG_016 [Aigis]]
I do not recommend using fire here― we[n]are guaranteed to be cooked alive within[n]this air duct.

[msg MSG_017 [Chie]]
Hrgh, it's so dark and scary... Are we[n]near the exit yet? Can we just get this[n]over with?

[msg MSG_018 [Chie]]
Ack! S-Something touched my face! It was[n]all hairy!

[msg MSG_019 [Koromaru]]
Arf, arf!

[msg MSG_020 [Chie]]
Oh, that was you, Koro-chan? *sigh* That[n]scared me...

[msg MSG_021 [Ryuji]]
Huh? But, I thought Koromaru was in[n]front of me―there's somethin' fluffy[n]touchin' my face...

[msg MSG_022 [Yusuke]]
That's me. Fox.

[msg MSG_023 [Ryuji]]
Waaaaaagh!?

[msg MSG_024 [Kanji]]
Hey, what's going on up th―
―Mmph!?

[msg MSG_025 [Morgana]]
Mew!?

[msg MSG_026 [Kanji]]
Wh-Whoaa... So soft...
Such soft, fluffy fur on my face... I'm[n]in heaven...

[msg MSG_027 [Morgana]]
Mrooowgh! Stop it! Quit rubbing your[n]face on my butt!

[msg MSG_028 [Kanji]]
Ow! Don't kick me like that!
Oh... But damn, those paw pads... Try[n]kickin' me again...

[msg MSG_029 [Morgana]]
Okay, we're getting out of here RIGHT[n]NOW!!! Move it! Move it!

[msg MSG_030 [Akechi]]
Mona, please stop digging your claws[n]into my legs―O-Ow... Oww!

[msg MSG_031 [Chie]]
Hey, I'm hurtin' up here too, y'know![n]The nose on your mask keeps pokin' me,[n]Crow!

[msg MSG_032 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_033 [Ribbon]]
KOROMARU-SAN, WHAT IS THE MATTER? WHY[n]ARE YOU NUDGING MY BACK?

[msg MSG_034 [Koromaru]]
Arf, arf!

[msg MSG_035 [Ribbon]]
"IT'S FUN PLAYING WITH EVERYONE"?
THIS IS THE FEELING... OF FUN?

[msg MSG_036 [Koromaru]]
Awoooo!

[msg MSG_037 [Ribbon]]
ARE YOU GIVING ME A HELPING PUSH? SO[n]THAT WE MAY KEEP GOING TOGETHER?

[msg MSG_038 [Koromaru]]
Awoooo!

[msg MSG_039 [Ribbon]]
KOROMARU-SAN... THANK YOU SO MUCH.

[msg MSG_040 [Junpei]]
C'mon, what's with the holdup? Yosuke,[n]can't you go a bit faster?

[msg MSG_041 [Yosuke]]
Don't complain to me. The stoppage is[n]all thanks to Teddie up here!

[msg MSG_042 [Yosuke]]
Hey, Teddie, obviously you're too big[n]for this duct! Why didn't you take your[n]costume off before getting in!?

[msg MSG_043 [Teddie]]
It's okay. I can keep going if you push[n]me from behind, Yosuke.

[msg MSG_044 [Yosuke]]
What are you, ground meat in a sausage[n]machine!? Quit being lazy and move your[n]own body!

[msg MSG_045 [Makoto]]
Whew... This is going rather slowly, but[n]I suppose we're still making progress?

[msg MSG_046 [Shinjiro]]
I'm sure we'll reach the exit eventually[n]But seriously... this thing is too[n]cramped.

[msg MSG_047 [Akihiko]]
Crawling is a good form of training.[n]Tightens up your abs and latissimus[n]dorsi muscles so you can―

[msg MSG_048 [Shinjiro]]
Oh, shut up. Put those muscles to use[n]and just keep moving!

[msg MSG_049 [Akihiko]]
What? I'm just using this opportunity[n]instead of wasting my time complaining[n]about being cramped―

[msg MSG_050 [Mitsuru]]
Will you two quiet down!? Keep it up and[n]I'll freeze you both soli―
Whaa―!?

[msg MSG_051 [Haru]]
Oh―pardon me, Mitsuru-san. My hand got[n]caught on your skirt.

[msg MSG_052 [Mitsuru]]
I-I see... Please don't surprise me like[n]that. It's hard to see in here, after[n]all.

[msg MSG_053 [Junpei]]
Oho, what's this? Is Mitsuru-senpai not[n]a fan of the dark?
Well, that's a surprising weakness for[n]her. A stunning revelation that makes[n]someone like her more adorable―

[msg MSG_054 [Mitsuru]]
Iori, do you wish to be frozen as well?

[msg MSG_055 [Junpei]]
J-Just kidding! I was just joking!

[msg MSG_056 [Yukari]]
Um, could you guys please hurry it up?[n]We've been waiting back here for a while[n]now.

[msg MSG_057 [P3 Fem Protag]]
*giggle*

[msg MSG_058 [Yukari]]
Huh? What's funny?

[msg MSG_059 [P3 Fem Protag]]
It's just that you guys act exactly like[n]the companions I know.

[msg MSG_060 [Yukari]]
Hmm, I see...

[msg MSG_061 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Sorry for bringing up something so[n]weird. C'mon, let's keep going!
