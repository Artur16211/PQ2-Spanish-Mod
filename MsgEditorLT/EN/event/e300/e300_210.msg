[msg MSG_000 [Junpei]]
Dude―who turned out the lights!?

[msg MSG_000_05 [Junpei]]
Are we locked in here!?

[msg MSG_001 [Akihiko]]
Tch, is this some kinda trap!?

[msg MSG_002 [Exam system AI]]
UNITS TK-00, 01. UNITS YS-02, 05, 07.
UNITS IW-02, 03, 09. UNIT UIY-2249.
BEGINNING THE "POWER" EXAM. PLEASE CARRY[n]ONE FULL TON TO THE SPECIFIED LOCATION.

[msg MSG_003 [Ryuji]]
Wha―ONE TON!? We've gotta carry 1000[n]effin' kilograms!?

[msg MSG_004 [Exam system AI]]
NOTE: COOPERATION IS REQUIRED IN THIS[n]TEST. IF A TASK IS FAILED, ALL WILL FACE[n]THE CONSEQUENCES.
EACH UNIT WILL BE CONSIDERED CRITICALLY[n]ERRONEOUS AND DISPOSED OF IMMEDIATELY.
YOUR TIME LIMIT IS 10 MINUTES. THE EXAM[n]BEGINS NOW.

[msg MSG_005 [Teddie]]
What kind of place is this!? And what's[n]with that "disposed of" part!?

[msg MSG_006 [Junpei]]
Oh man... Are we seriously supposed to[n]carry a whole ton?

[msg MSG_007 [Akihiko]]
It doesn't seem like we have to carry[n]one ton all at once, though―look over[n]there.

[msg MSG_008 [Shinjiro]]
Oh, a scale...
So, we just gotta carry those boxes over[n]there and make the weight add up to one[n]ton.

[msg MSG_009 [Kanji]]
Heh, piece of cake! If we haul multiple[n]boxes in each trip, this'll be over in―
Hold up, this shit's heavy! How many[n]kilograms are these things, anyway!?

[msg MSG_010 [Teddie]]
Umm... It says 40 kg.

[sel SEL_011 top]
That's light.
That's heavy...
I don't know what that means.

[msg MSG_012 [Shinjiro]]
Maybe not for us, but―you think you can[n]manage that, Chie? Those boxes are[n]basically 20 2-liter bottles apiece...

[msg MSG_013 [Chie]]
Guh... I'm not too confident about[n]carrying 40 kg at once...

[msg MSG_014 [Akihiko]]
Don't knock it 'til you try it! We just[n]have to think of it as a workout.

[msg MSG_015 [Akihiko]]
It's like four 10 kg dumbbells apiece.[n]It'll be a breeze if we just think of it[n]like it's training.

[msg MSG_016 [Junpei]]
Yeah, easy-peasy... For YOU,[n]Akihiko-senpai!

[msg MSG_017 [Ryuji]]
Oh yeah! Ribbon, can't you carry a lot[n]at once? I mean, you're a robot, sooo...

[msg MSG_018 [Ribbon]]
I AM SORRY, BUT MY MAXIMUM LIFT CAPACITY[n]IS 20 kg.

[msg MSG_019 [Chie]]
Then we can carry one together,[n]Ribbon-chan!
Let's see, we need a total of one ton,[n]so... how many boxes is that?

[msg MSG_020 [Ribbon]]
25. THERE ARE SEVEN OTHERS BESIDES[n]YOURSELF AND MYSELF, SO IT WILL TAKE[n]APPROXIMATELY 3.125 TRIPS.

[msg MSG_021 [Junpei]]
Welp, time to get to work. Hup―!
Agh... No good, this is murder for my[n]back! I'm gonna regret choosing this[n]exam by the end of this sentence!

[msg MSG_022 [Teddie]]
Hrghh... I'm regretting it even faster!

[msg MSG_023 [Shinjiro]]
We ain't got time to fool around. Hurry[n]up and grab some boxes!

[msg MSG_024]
We managed to make one trip apiece...

[msg MSG_025 [Chie]]
Oh man, I completely underestimated[n]this... I'm gonna drop dead.

[msg MSG_026 [Ryuji]]
Seriously, this is nuts. They're so much[n]heavier than I expected...

[msg MSG_027 [Teddie]]
I'm such a fragile pretty boy, I wasn't[n]able to move any at all...

[msg MSG_028 [Akihiko]]
We've only got 320 kg on there so far.[n]There's 680 kg to go―no time for being[n]worn out!

[msg MSG_029 [Shinjiro]]
So that's like two more trips and[n]change, huh... How much time we got[n]left?

[msg MSG_030 [Ribbon]]
6 MINUTES AND 28 SECONDS.

[msg MSG_031 [Kanji]]
Tch―are we stuck just toughin' this[n]out!?

[sel SEL_032 top]
Let's think of another approach.
We have to do this.
What should we do?

[msg MSG_033 [Akihiko]]
We don't have the time to stand around[n]and think. We'll have to do it while[n]moving boxes.

[msg MSG_034 [Shinjiro]]
But if we just do it normally, we'll run[n]outta time. If only we had another[n]way...

[msg MSG_035 [Akihiko]]
Well, I know we don't have the time to[n]stand around and think about it. We'll[n]have to do it while moving boxes.

[msg MSG_036 [Kanji]]
You're askin' me!? Uh, how about...[n]Well, IS there some kinda other way to[n]do this?

[msg MSG_037 [Akihiko]]
I dunno, but we don't have the time to[n]stand around and think about it. We'll[n]have to do it while moving boxes.

[msg MSG_038 [Ryuji]]
Alright, let's do it! Round two!

[msg MSG_039 [Junpei]]
*pant* *gasp* My back and arms are[n]shot... I'm past my limit after just two[n]rounds...

[msg MSG_040 [Chie]]
*pant* *pant* Anyone got any bright[n]ideas on how else we can do this?

[msg MSG_041 [Kanji]]
Why don't we jam the last boxes inside[n]Teddie's costume and just roll him over[n]there?

[msg MSG_042 [Chie]]
Ooh, great idea! He's mostly empty in[n]there, so maybe it'll all fit?

[msg MSG_043 [Teddie]]
Hey! This suit's not some kind of pocket[n]dimension!
Plus, my coat is genuine bear fur. It's[n]heavier than it looks! I get tuckered[n]out extra-fast!

[msg MSG_044 [Ryuji]]
Then why the hell'd ya join the "Power"[n]team!?

[msg MSG_045 [Ribbon]]
2 MINUTES AND 30 SECONDS REMAINING.

[msg MSG_046 [Shinjiro]]
Shit... We're runnin' outta time. If we[n]don't put up 360 kg at once, we're done[n]for.

[msg MSG_047 [Junpei]]
Hey, Joker! Can't you come up with some[n]cool scheme with your... Phantom[n]Thieves... expertness?

[sel SEL_048 top]
Don't be ridiculous.
We'll be the extra weight.
Let's ask Skull to cook up a plan.

[msg MSG_049 [Akihiko]]
But we have to finish this, no matter[n]how ridiculous our plan is...

[msg MSG_050 [Akihiko]]
...That's it! We've just gotta get[n]ridiculous!

[msg MSG_051 [Shinjiro]]
What'd you come up with?

[msg MSG_052 [Akihiko]]
The scale's display has to be one ton,[n]right?
Well, who says all the weight has to[n]come from the boxes?
If we get on the scale, our own weight[n]would be just as good.

[msg MSG_053 [Chie]]
Oh, I getcha! The total weight on the[n]scale just has to be one ton!

[msg MSG_054 [Akihiko]]
Yeah, there weren't any rules about what[n]goes on the scale.
Heh, that's a pretty impressive plan.[n]Nice work!

[msg MSG_055 [Ryuji]]
What!? How ridiculous can you be!?

[msg MSG_056 [Akihiko]]
...That's it! We've just gotta get[n]ridiculous!

[msg MSG_057 [Shinjiro]]
What'd you come up with?

[msg MSG_058 [Akihiko]]
The scale's display has to be one ton,[n]right?
Well, who says all the weight has to[n]come from the boxes?
If we get on the scale, our own weight[n]would be just as good.

[msg MSG_059 [Kanji]]
Ohhh! Well, lemme give it a shot!

[msg MSG_060 [Chie]]
Yes! It works!

[msg MSG_061 [Ryuji]]
Hell yeah! C'mon everybody, line up!
If all of us including Ribbon hops on, I[n]bet we'll have a ton on there, no[n]problem!

[msg MSG_062 [Chie]]
H-Hold on! Can we not get on there one[n]at a time!?

[msg MSG_063 [Junpei]]
Yeah yeah, we know. Alrighty then, let's[n]go on the count of three...
One, two, three!

[msg MSG_064 [Junpei]]
Ooh, 1162 kg!

[msg MSG_065 [Exam system AI]]
THE TARGET WEIGHT IS EXCEEDED BY 162 kg.[n]PLEASE TRY AGAIN.

[msg MSG_066 [Akihiko]]
Looks like we have to make it exactly[n]one ton.

[msg MSG_067 [Ryuji]]
Should we all get off, then get back on[n]one at a time?

[msg MSG_068 [Chie]]
Hey! No way! I'm not about to reveal[n]that information...

[msg MSG_069 [Shinjiro]]
We can adjust the weight by 40 kg with[n]the boxes, but since it's 162 kg over,[n]it won't be enough. What do we do now?

[sel SEL_070 top]
Have Chie step off the scale.
Have Kanji step off the scale.
Have Teddie strip down.

[msg MSG_071 [Chie]]
NO! None of you are finding out how much[n]I weigh! You'll never get me off here!

[msg MSG_072 [Akihiko]]
We're running out of time!

[msg MSG_073 [Kanji]]
Dammit! In that case... Hey, Teddie![n]Strip down!

[msg MSG_074 [Teddie]]
Gyaaaah! Kanji's lost it! Stay awaaay!

[msg MSG_075 [Kanji]]
I'm 65 kg, though. Would that work?

[msg MSG_076 [Akihiko]]
No, the math won't add up that way.[n]We're running out of time here!

[msg MSG_077 [Kanji]]
Dammit! In that case... Hey, Teddie![n]Strip down!

[msg MSG_078 [Teddie]]
Gyaaaah! Kanji's lost it! Stay awaaay!

[msg MSG_079 [Teddie]]
Hrmmm!? I may be a pretty boy, but[n]that's a bit too bold for even me...

[msg MSG_080 [Kanji]]
Just shuddap and do it! This is the[n]zipper, right?

[msg MSG_081 [Teddie]]
Aaagh! Y-You're catching my skin! Owie[n]owie owie!

[msg MSG_082 [Shinjiro]]
Hey, we don't have time to play around.[n]We're just a few seconds from―

[msg MSG_083 [Kanji]]
Wait―The hell!? There's a ton o' shit[n]inside him!

[msg MSG_084 [Chie]]
What the―Popcorn!?
There's also some juice boxes, and[n]chocolate, and... Geez, there's like[n]half a pantry in here!

[msg MSG_085 [Ryuji]]
How long have you been stashing all this[n]food!?

[msg MSG_086 [Teddie]]
I can't believe you found my most hidden[n]treats... You naughty snack raiders!

[msg MSG_087 [Akihiko]]
Looks like there's at least 2 kg worth[n]of stuff in here. Alright, out it goes!

[msg MSG_088 [Teddie]]
Stop―not my snacks! Noooooooooo!

[msg MSG_089 [Junpei]]
Ooh, we're at 1160 kg now!

[msg MSG_090 [Akihiko]]
Awesome! All that's left is pushing four[n]boxes off, and...

[msg MSG_091 [Exam system AI]]
TARGET RESULT CONFIRMED. THIS CONCLUDES[n]THE "POWER" EXAM.

[msg MSG_092 [Ryuji]]
Hell yeah! We made it by the skin of our[n]teeth!

[msg MSG_093 [Teddie]]
*sniffle* My stockpile... Gone in a[n]poof...

[msg MSG_094 [Chie]]
C'mon, don't be so sad. We can get you[n]some popcorn later!
...And by that, I mean Yosuke will.

[msg MSG_095 [Junpei]]
Man, was that close! I seriously thought[n]we were gonna get disposed of...

[msg MSG_096 [Ribbon]]
WE PASSED THE EXAM... BUT OUR METHOD DID[n]NOT FOLLOW THE STANDARD EXAMINATION[n]PROCESS.

[msg MSG_097 [Teddie]]
Tisk, tisk―that just shows you how[n]Teddies are anything but standard!

[msg MSG_098 [Ribbon]]
......?

[msg MSG_099 [Shinjiro]]
Robots only follow orders. They don't[n]know how to deal with loopholes the way[n]that we do.

[msg MSG_100 [Junpei]]
That's human intelligence for ya! Either[n]way, we got a pass.

[msg MSG_101 [Akihiko]]
Regardless of the method, we're done[n]here.
Once we hit that release button, let's[n]hurry back.

[msg MSG_102 [Ribbon]]
......

[msg MSG_103]
Meanwhile, in the "Knowledge" exam[n]room...

[msg MSG_104 [Yosuke]]
Great job, partner! Another right[n]answer!

[msg MSG_105 [Makoto]]
Cheering us on is fine and all, but you[n]need to contribute too, Hanamura-kun.[n]You haven't answered yet.

[msg MSG_106 [Yosuke]]
Eheheh... I know, I know! It's time for[n]me to get serious!

[msg MSG_107 [P4 Hero]]
I'm counting on you, Yosuke. Let's all[n]get through this together.

[msg MSG_108 [Mitsuru]]
Right―you can do this!

[msg MSG_109]
Meanwhile, in the "Adaptation" exam[n]room...

[msg MSG_110 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I'll go first, so―everyone, just follow[n]my lead!

Yeah, me too!

Wow, [f 6 1 27 0 0 0]-chan's really doing a great[n]job.
