Hmm...
This door seems to be locked. I don’t[n]think you can go through there...

[msg MSG_001 [Yukari]]
But, there’s no other path to take...

[msg MSG_002 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_003 [Aigis]]
Koromaru-san says, “There was that air[n]duct."

[msg MSG_004 [Yukari]]
Ugh... Do we really have to go through[n]that?

[msg MSG_005 [Makoto]]
Once you get used to ductwork, it’s[n]surprisingly not that bad.

[msg MSG_006 [Ann]]
Ahaha... Getting used to something like[n]that is a bit unsettling as well.

[msg MSG_007 [Morgana]]
If we've got our plan figured out, then[n]let’s do it. Get ready for some air duct[n]infiltration!
