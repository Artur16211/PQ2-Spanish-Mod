[msg MSG_000 [Yukiko]]
Whew! Finally took care of that...

[msg MSG_001 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I was so focused on rescuing everyone[n]that I really went overboard on those[n]Shadows back there.

[msg MSG_002 [Haru]]
*giggle* I think I may have gone a bit[n]crazy as well...

[msg MSG_003 [Yosuke]]
A-Anyway, thanks for that... I'm glad[n]you were reunited with your companions a[n]lot sooner than we expected!

[msg MSG_004 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Mmhm! And it's all thanks to you guys.

[msg MSG_005 [Well-dressed girl]]
I must thank you for helping us back[n]there. We were ambushed in this strange[n]world we've found ourselves in...

[msg MSG_006 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I feel so much better knowing you're all[n]safe. I was worried sick about finding[n]you...

[msg MSG_007 [Boy with baseball cap]]
Uhh, so... Are you a student at[n]Gekkoukan High?

[msg MSG_008 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Huh? What are you talking about, Junpei?

[msg MSG_009 [Boy with baseball cap]]
Whaaat!? How'd you know my name!?
I mean, I suspected that I had quite a[n]few secret fans at school, but to think[n]I'd meet one here in this weird place...

[msg MSG_010 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Huh...?

[msg MSG_011 [Spirited girl]]
Um, she's not a fan of yours, Junpei. I[n]only need common sense to know that[n]much.

[msg MSG_012 [Boy with beanie]]
She can wield a Persona―maybe she's a[n]new addition to the squad that the[n]Chairman set up?

[msg MSG_013 [Well-dressed girl]]
No, I've been told nothing about such[n]personnel changes...

[msg MSG_014 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Uh, what is...?

[msg MSG_015 [Akechi]]
Something feels off here. There seems to[n]be an inconsistency in their recognition[n]of one another...

[msg MSG_016 [Quiet girl]]
Um... She's got a SEES armband. Her[n]Evoker seems authentic, too...

[msg MSG_017 [Aggressive boy]]
What the hell's going on? She doesn't[n]seem like an enemy, but...

[msg MSG_018 [P3 Fem Protag]]
What are you guys whispering about?
More importantly―where's Aigis? Is she[n]not with you!?

[msg MSG_019 [Spirited girl]]
You know about Aigis!?

[msg MSG_020 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Well, of course I know her. She's our[n]companion...

[msg MSG_021 [Well-dressed girl]]
......
I don't mean to sound rude, what with[n]your rescuing us and all... but, who[n]exactly are you?

[msg MSG_022 [Ryuji]]
Wait a minute, wait a minute! What is[n]happening here?

[sel SEL_023 top]
Nobody recognizes her?
It could be the casting effect...

[msg MSG_024 [P3 Fem Protag]]
No way... But, I recognize every one of[n]them!

[msg MSG_025 [Somber child]]
Um, I'm sorry...

[msg MSG_026 [Dog]]
*whine*

[msg MSG_027 [Somber child]]
Casting...? I'm sorry, but I don't[n]really understand what you mean...

[msg MSG_028 [Dog]]
*whine*

[msg MSG_029 [Yosuke]]
Well, we thought she was getting[n]reunited with her companions, but now...[n]What IS happening?

[msg MSG_030 [Naoto]]
I'm fairly certain we won't get anywhere[n]discussing all of this here.
Why don't we talk things over in the[n]movie theater we've been using as our[n]base of operations?

[msg MSG_031 [Yusuke]]
I concur.
They seem rather exhausted... and I'm[n]starting to get rather hungry.

[msg MSG_032 [Spirited girl]]
Whoa, wait a sec―we didn't say anything[n]about going with you people anywhere.

[sel SEL_033 top]
Don't you trust us?
We're not suspicious.
You'd better come with us.

[msg MSG_034 [Naoto]]
They're in unfamiliar territory, and[n]we're strangers to them... I guess[n]there's nothing we can do about it, but―

[msg MSG_035 [Yosuke]]
You're just gonna flat-out say you're[n]not suspicious... while dressed like[n]that?

[msg MSG_036 [Morgana]]
Moron, don't say it like that! Now we[n]sound even more suspicious! Act like a[n]gentleman―got it!?

[msg MSG_037 [Well-dressed girl]]
...Very well, we'll accompany you.

[msg MSG_038 [Spirited girl]]
Senpai!?

[msg MSG_039 [Well-dressed girl]]
Not only are they Persona-users, but[n]they risked their lives to save us.
That alone is enough to trust them for[n]now. More importantly, we have no one[n]else to rely on here.

[msg MSG_040 [Aggressive boy]]
She's got a point... There are a lot of[n]unknowns right now, so we need to find[n]out what we can.

[msg MSG_041 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Um... So, what's happened to Aigis?

[msg MSG_042 [Quiet girl]]
Aigis and our leader got separated from[n]us somewhere along the way...

[msg MSG_043 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Wait―you've got a leader!?

[msg MSG_044 [Spirited girl]]
Well, yeah. I mean, not right this[n]second, but―is that what you mean?

[msg MSG_045 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Uh, no, I meant like... How can I[n]explain?

[msg MSG_046 [P4 Hero]]
Looks like things are even more[n]complicated than we first thought.

[msg MSG_047 [Akechi]]
All the more reason to return to the[n]movie theater and settle our nerves[n]before talking things over.
We can explain what we know about this[n]world on our way to the exit.

[msg MSG_048 [Well-dressed girl]]
I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but[n]we're more than happy to hear you out.[n]We're wholly confused about this...
But―What a hassle this is... There's a[n]matter more important than intel that we[n]must also address.
We don't have any time to spare... I[n]apologize for being so forward, but[n]please, make the details quick for us.

[msg MSG_049 [P3 Fem Protag]]
......

[msg MSG_050 [Ann]]
C'mon, why don't we head back and see[n]what they have to say first? There could[n]be some kinda reason for all this...

[msg MSG_051 [P3 Fem Protag]]
You're right... Sorry. Yeah, I should[n]make sure to talk to them some more when[n]we're back at the theater.
