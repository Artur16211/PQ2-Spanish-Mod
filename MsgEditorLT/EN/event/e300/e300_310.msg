[msg MSG_000 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Whew! We can rest easy now. Are you two[n]okay?

[msg MSG_001 [Aigis]]
......

[msg MSG_002 [Ken]]
...Aigis-san?

[msg MSG_003 [Aigis]]
......

[msg MSG_004 [Junpei]]
U-Umm... Earth to Ai-chan?
You've been awfully quiet all this[n]time... Uhhh... This seems bad!

[msg MSG_005 [Yusuke]]
Don't tell me―is she broken?

[msg MSG_006 [Teddie]]
Nooo, did we fail to make it in time!?[n]How do we fix her up?

[msg MSG_007 [Boy with earphones]]
Don't worry. She used a special power[n]earlier, so she's just overheated at the[n]moment.

[msg MSG_008 [Akechi]]
A special power, you say?

[msg MSG_009 [Mitsuru]]
It's called Orgia Mode. She'll recover[n]on her own over time. There's no need to[n]worry.

[msg MSG_010 [Haru]]
I see―thank goodness! What a relief.

[msg MSG_011 [Akihiko]]
I don't mean to rush you, but what[n]happened to you two when we got here?

[msg MSG_012 [Boy with earphones]]
Aigis and I were captured by a robot[n]called the "Overseer" only a few moments[n]after we arrived.

[msg MSG_013 [Junpei]]
You're talkin' about the one that looks[n]like Ikutsuki-san, right?

[msg MSG_014 [Boy with earphones]]
Yeah. He said that he was going to[n]"dispose of us," so we waited for our[n]chance, then escaped...
But, eventually we were overwhelmed with[n]pursuers, and we had to fight while[n]fleeing.

[msg MSG_015 [Yukari]]
And that's around the time you lost your[n]Evoker?

[msg MSG_016 [Boy with earphones]]
I guess so... By the time I realized it[n]was gone, there was no way that we could[n]turn around and look for it.

[msg MSG_017 [Mitsuru]]
I see. I commend you for standing your[n]ground in the meantime with no one but[n]Aigis at your side.
We were searching for you two all this[n]time... I apologize for taking so long.

[msg MSG_018 [Boy with earphones]]
No, thanks to you all coming, we were[n]rescued at the right time. I'm grateful.
By the way, I've been wondering... Uh,[n]who are those people with you?

[msg MSG_019 [Yukari]]
Oh―right, we need to explain everything.[n]It'll take a while, though.

[msg MSG_020 [Naoto]]
Then why don't we use this opportunity[n]to return to the movie theater?
I believe it'd be best for those two to[n]take a break somewhere more peaceful.

[sel SEL_021 top]
That would be for the best.
Let's keep pushing forward.
I want to learn more about him.

[msg MSG_022 [Makoto]]
But they won't be able to rest properly[n]here, and who knows when another wave of[n]robots may arrive?
I agree with Naoto that it would be best[n]to return to the theater.

[msg MSG_023 [Yusuke]]

[msg MSG_024 [Boy with earphones]]
......

[msg MSG_025 [Morgana]]
Well, that settles that. We'll explain[n]what's going on along the way.
*sigh* I can't even count how many times[n]we've already gone over this...

[msg MSG_026 [Futaba]]
That's just what our lives are now.[n]Nuthin' we can do about it.

[msg MSG_027 [Boy with earphones]]
Sorry for the trouble. So, we need to go[n]to some movie theater?

[msg MSG_028 [Akechi]]
It's definitely helpful that you can[n]grasp such a strange situation so[n]quickly.

[msg MSG_029 [Ryuji]]
C'mon, let's head back.

[msg MSG_030 [Yukari]]
Wait―going back to the movie theater is[n]fine for us, but what about Ribbon?

[msg MSG_031 [Yukiko]]
Now that you mention it―can Ribbon-chan[n]leave this movie?

[msg MSG_032 [Mitsuru]]
I have no idea whether or not there[n]would be any ill effects for her...

[msg MSG_033 [Futaba]]
Precision machinery is very delicate. We[n]shouldn't bring her around any setting[n]that she's not designed for.

[msg MSG_034 [Chie]]
So should we try to hide her somewhere?[n]Oh, but what if she got caught by those[n]security robots?

[msg MSG_035 [Ribbon]]
IF THIS CONCERNS YOU, I BELIEVE THERE IS[n]A SOLUTION.
I SHOULD NOT BE IDENTIFIABLE TO THE[n]SECURITY ROBOTS' SENSORS IF I SUSPEND MY[n]OPERATIONS.

[msg MSG_036 [Naoto]]
Suspend your operations? Do you mean[n]power down?

[msg MSG_037 [Ribbon]]
NO. I HAVE A SLEEP MODE. I AM ABLE TO[n]TEMPORARILY AND HARMLESSLY SUSPEND[n]OPERATIONS.

[msg MSG_038 [Yusuke]]
Oh? That sounds useful. Then, I shall go[n]ahead and activate―

[msg MSG_039 [Ann]]
Hey! Don't go fiddling with her settings[n]without her permission!

[msg MSG_040 [Makoto]]
Even if you're able to avoid their[n]sensors, I'm concerned about just[n]leaving you here in the open.
Why don't you take cover somewhere[n]before engaging sleep mode?

[msg MSG_041 [P4 Hero]]
I agree. That definitely sounds like it[n]would be safer.

[msg MSG_042 [Yosuke]]
Alright, let's get Ribbon-chan in sleep[n]mode and head back to the movie theater!
