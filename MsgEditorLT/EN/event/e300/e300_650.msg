Alright, that's one more movie fixed up![n]Let's get back to the movie theater!

[msg MSG_001 [Yukiko]]
Doe should have spat out another key to[n]the locks, right?

[msg MSG_002 [P3 Hero]]
So, ah... Did you guys really say, when[n]the movie reaches the end, that the key[n]comes out of the projectionist's head?

[msg MSG_003 [Teddie]]
Yep!
First, he's all, "Grrrrhhhhhaaaah!" and[n]flopping around, then it pours from his[n]face and lands with a thick "plop."

[msg MSG_004 [Yukari]]
Ugh, that sounds really gross...

[msg MSG_005 [Chie]]
That's because Teddie did a TERRIBLE job[n]describing it!
In reality, it comes out more like...[n]"bloop"? Or, I guess "poink" works too?

[msg MSG_006 [Junpei]]
Ooh, I love the way "poink" sounds! But,[n]"plop" is... a bit too real for me.

[msg MSG_007 [Fuuka]]
E-Everyone! Listen!

[msg MSG_008 [P4 Hero]]
What's wrong?

[msg MSG_009 [Rise]]
Senpai! Everyone! I'm sorry, it happened[n]when we looked away for a second!

[msg MSG_010 [Fuuka]]
Hikari-chan's...!

[msg MSG_011 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Calm down, Fuuka. What's this about[n]Hikari-chan!?

[msg MSG_012 [Fuuka]]
Just, come back as fast as you can![n]Please!

[msg MSG_013 [Makoto]]
It seems to be an emergency. We should[n]hurry back!
