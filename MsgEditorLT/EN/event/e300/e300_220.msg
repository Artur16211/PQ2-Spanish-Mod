Wha―We're locked in!? Talk about a[n]clich〒 turn of events!

[msg MSG_001 [Yosuke]]
Oh shit, is this some kind of trap!?

[msg MSG_002 [Mitsuru]]
Quiet! I can hear something.

[msg MSG_003 [Exam system AI]]
UNITS TK-00, 03, 05, 06, 08. UNITS[n]YS-01, 06.
UNIT IW-04. UNIT UIY-2249.
INITIATING THE "KNOWLEDGE" EVALUATION[n]EXAM. PLEASE ANSWER THE FOLLOWING[n]QUESTIONS.
NOTE: COOPERATION IS REQUIRED IN THIS[n]TEST. IF A TASK IS FAILED, ALL WILL FACE[n]THE CONSEQUENCES.
EACH UNIT WILL BE CONSIDERED CRITICALLY[n]ERRONEOUS AND DISPOSED OF IMMEDIATELY.

[msg MSG_004 [Morgana]]
"Disposed of"!?

[msg MSG_005 [Akechi]]
Well, this is pretty much what I'd[n]expected. We need to solve the problems[n]before we're "disposed of."

[msg MSG_006 [Yosuke]]
Dude, I'm not ready to die yet! Oh no...[n]I really need to find the bathroom...

[sel SEL_007 top]
Aren't you chief of operations?
Just hold it.

[msg MSG_008 [Yosuke]]
Yeah, but I'm more of a "deep thinker"[n]type! Oh man, I'm so nervous, my[n]stomach's starting to churn!

[msg MSG_009 [Yosuke]]
I-I will, but... I'm so nervous, my[n]stomach's starting to churn!

[msg MSG_010 [Makoto]]
Calm down, will you? We can't leave this[n]place until we answer the questions.

[msg MSG_011 [Exam system AI]]
THE EXAM WILL NOW COMMENCE. CHEATING[n]WILL RESULT IN PUNISHMENT FOR ALL UNITS.

[msg MSG_012 [Exam system AI]]
THESE QUESTIONS HAVE MULTIPLE ANSWERS.[n]PLEASE PROVIDE ONE CORRECT ANSWER PER[n]UNIT.
YOU MAY REPLY IN ANY ORDER, BUT ALL[n]ANSWERS MUST BE PROVIDED PROMPTLY.

[msg MSG_013 [Naoto]]
This exam... It's the type that becomes[n]more difficult to answer, the further we[n]get through the questions.
It'd be best if those who are more[n]confident in their knowledge would[n]answer later in the order.

[msg MSG_014 [Yosuke]]
Going first is so nerve-wracking, right[n]guys? I'll go ahead and take the lead[n]so―

[msg MSG_015 [Morgana]]
No! I should... boost the party's morale[n]by leading the charge! Yeah.

[msg MSG_016 [Yosuke]]
Oh no―I'll take the plunge for you.

[msg MSG_017 [Futaba]]
If you're both so insecure about this,[n]then you two can go first.

[msg MSG_018 [Morgana]]
But―It's not that I'm insecure! I[n]just... wanted to set an example for the[n]Phantom Thieves!

[msg MSG_019 [Mitsuru]]
By the way, how much do you know,[n]Ribbon?

[msg MSG_020 [Futaba]]
Ohhh, she wanted nothing to do with that[n]excuse.

[msg MSG_021 [Ribbon]]
I AM CAPABLE OF ANSWERING GENERAL[n]QUERIES.

[msg MSG_022 [Akechi]]
Then, I guess Ribbon-san would be best[n]to go in the middle? Leave the last to[n]me.

[msg MSG_023 [Naoto]]
I have no objections to that. I don't[n]mind being in the latter half as well.

[msg MSG_024 [Exam system AI]]
WE SHALL NOW BEGIN. QUESTION 1...
PROVIDE AN IDIOM THAT CONTAINS TWO OR[n]MORE NUMBERS IN IT.

[msg MSG_025 [Morgana]]
Wh-What? Two numbers?
Oh, I've got one! Obviously, "killing[n]two birds with one stone"!

[msg MSG_026 [Yosuke]]
Heheh, I thought of one right away too.[n]"One in a million"!

[msg MSG_027 [Ribbon]]
MY ANSWER IS, "NINE-TO-FIVE JOB."

[msg MSG_028 [Makoto]]
Then, I'll go with, "as easy as one-two-[n]three." Joker, would you care to go[n]next?

[msg MSG_028_05 [Makoto]]
We need another idiom with two or more[n]numbers in it. Think hard!

[sel SEL_029 top]
Two heads are better than one.
Two's company; three's a crowd.
Nothing beats eating meat.

[msg MSG_030 [Mitsuru]]
People working together can achieve[n]greater results than when alone... That[n]actually describes us quite well.

[msg MSG_031 [Akechi]]
If we put all of our heads together, I'm[n]certain we can change this movie in no[n]time.

[msg MSG_032 [Morgana]]
Well, that counts, but... I would've[n]liked a more spirited idiom.

[msg MSG_033 [Futaba]]
More spirited, huh? How about, "all for[n]one and one for all"?

[msg MSG_034 [Makoto]]
"One in a million" sounds like a[n]spirited way to describe our own leader.

[msg MSG_035 [Yosuke]]
What's that, your Chie impression!? It[n]doesn't even have ONE number in it!

[msg MSG_036 [Makoto]]
Plus, it's not really an idiom. You need[n]to give an answer that fits the exam's[n]parameters.

[msg MSG_037 [Futaba]]
Welp, I'm up. I'll go with, "nine times[n]out of ten"!

[msg MSG_038 [Mitsuru]]
Then, mine shall be, "six of one, half a[n]dozen of the other."

[msg MSG_039 [Naoto]]
I'll go with "getting eighty-sixed."[n]Please take care of the last one,[n]Akechi-san.

[msg MSG_040 [Akechi]]
No problem. How about "a hundred-to- one[n]shot"?

[msg MSG_041 [Exam system AI]]
ALL ANSWERS ARE CORRECT.

[msg MSG_042 [Morgana]]
Whew... We managed to squeak by that[n]one.

[msg MSG_043 [Yosuke]]
Crap, I didn't even know half of those.[n]Something about eighty sixes, and―

[msg MSG_044 [Exam system AI]]
NOW, FOR THE NEXT QUESTION...
THE RESPONDENT WILL BE SELECTED AT[n]RANDOM. EACH SPECIFIED UNIT MUST ANSWER[n]IMMEDIATELY.

[msg MSG_045 [Morgana]]
We have more!? And it's random now!?

[msg MSG_046 [Exam system AI]]
WE SHALL NOW BEGIN. QUESTION 2...
LIST SEVEN METALLIC ELEMENTS. HOWEVER,[n]"GOLD," "SILVER," AND "COPPER" WILL NOT[n]BE ACCEPTED.

[msg MSG_047 [Mitsuru]]
That's common knowledge. We should be[n]able to clear this one just as easily as[n]the last.

[msg MSG_048 [Yosuke]]
Wait, really!? Metallic... elements?

[msg MSG_049 [Naoto]]
I think we should leave "that" certain[n]element for Yosuke-senpai...

[msg MSG_050 [Akechi]]
Good idea. It seems that we'll be[n]randomly selected, so I'll make sure not[n]to give "that" answer.

[msg MSG_051 [Futaba]]
A-yep. Anyone could guess "that" one.

[msg MSG_052 [Yosuke]]
Hang on―what's the "that" you're all[n]talking about!?

[msg MSG_053 [Exam system AI]]
COMMENCING QUESTION 2. UNIT TK-08...

[msg MSG_054 [Akechi]]
Looks like I'm the first one up.[n]"Beryllium."

[msg MSG_055 [Exam system AI]]
CORRECT. NEXT, UNIT TK-05...

[msg MSG_056 [Makoto]]
I suppose this truly is random. Well[n]then―"molybdenum."

[msg MSG_056_1 [Exam system AI]]
CORRECT. NEXT, UNIT YS-06...

[msg MSG_056_2 [Naoto]]
Well then, I shall go with, "tungsten."

[msg MSG_057 [Exam system AI]]
CORRECT. NEXT, UNIT IW-04...

[msg MSG_058 [Mitsuru]]
"Palladium."

[msg MSG_059 [Exam system AI]]

H-How about... Calcium? Bones are hard,[n]so maybe―
Oh, but there's no way that's metalli―

[msg MSG_073 [Exam system AI]]

[msg MSG_074 [Yosuke]]
Oh, what!? For real!? Man, am I glad I[n]just blurted out whatever popped in my[n]head!

[msg MSG_075 [Naoto]]
How is he our chief of operations...?

[msg MSG_076 [Exam system AI]]
CORRECT.

[msg MSG_077 [Akechi]]
Heh, how fitting―a "sci-fi-sounding"[n]element. Plus, he left "that" one for[n]Hanamura-kun.

[msg MSG_093 [Exam system AI]]
UNIT TK-03...

[msg MSG_094 [Morgana]]
Heheh, I know this all too well.[n]"Sodium."

[msg MSG_095 [Exam system AI]]
CORRECT.

[msg MSG_096 [Naoto]]
Okay, Yosuke-senpai―you're the last to[n]go. All you have to do is say "that"[n]one!

[msg MSG_097 [Yosuke]]
Oh, sure. So, ah... What do you mean by[n]"that" one?

[msg MSG_098 [Exam system AI]]
UNIT YS-01...

[msg MSG_100 [Exam system AI]]
CORRECT.

What? For real!? I said the right[n]thing!?

[msg MSG_102 [Naoto]]
How is he our chief of operations...?

[msg MSG_103 [Exam system AI]]
NOW, FOR THE FINAL QUESTION...

[msg MSG_104 [Makoto]]
Huh? There's STILL more?

[msg MSG_105 [Akechi]]
At least this is the last one―the end is[n]within sight.

[msg MSG_106 [Exam system AI]]
THERE ARE TWO GATES UP AHEAD, LABELED[n]OVERHEAD WITH AN O AND AN X.

[msg MSG_107 [Exam system AI]]
UPON HEARING THE FINAL QUESTION, PLEASE[n]PASS THROUGH THE GATE LABELED WITH THE[n]CORRECT ANSWER.
IF YOU SELECT THE WRONG GATE, YOU WILL[n]BE IMMEDIATELY DISPOSED OF VIA LETHAL[n]ELECTRICAL CURRENT.

[msg MSG_108 [Yosuke]]
Wha―We'll get fried!?

[msg MSG_109 [Morgana]]
We can't peek past the gates for a hint,[n]either...
Look―the electric current's running near[n]the foot of the entrances.

[msg MSG_110 [Makoto]]
So, we have to get a running start and[n]hurdle over one of those? That seems[n]like a strange way to answer a question.

[msg MSG_111 [Futaba]]
Nope! Nope nope nope! No way!
C'mon, this is supposed to be a test of[n]knowledge! Demanding athletic feats from[n]us now? That's cheating!

COMMENCING QUESTION 3...
IS "INDIVIDUALITY" A BENEFICIAL[n]ATTRIBUTE FOR A UNIT?

[msg MSG_114 [Futaba]]
Huh!? What kind of question is that?

[msg MSG_115 [Yosuke]]
This is clearly an "O." No question!

[msg MSG_116 [Ribbon]]
......

[msg MSG_117 [Akechi]]
Hold on a moment―we're in the midst of[n]an inspection for mass-produced robots.
Our own beliefs may not necessarily be[n]the correct answer for an exam in this[n]world.

[msg MSG_118 [Mitsuru]]
If we consider the principles espoused[n]by this movie, "X" would appear to be[n]the correct one...

[msg MSG_119 [Morgana]]
Is individuality good or bad here...[n]Which answer should we go with, Joker?

[sel SEL_120 top]
X.
O.
☆.

[msg MSG_121 [Makoto]]

[msg MSG_122 [Futaba]]
I know what you mean, but it still[n]pisses me off... Screw this exam, man!

[msg MSG_123 [Makoto]]
I can understand how you feel, Joker,[n]but this is a question that robots are[n]supposed to answer.

[msg MSG_124 [Morgana]]
That rebellious attitude is admirable,[n]but it wouldn't do us any good if it got[n]us electrocuted here.

[msg MSG_125 [Yosuke]]
Of course! Let's jump through "☆" and―
Wait―c'mon! "O" or "X" are the only[n]options!

[msg MSG_126 [Makoto]]
*sigh* Could you two comedians cut the[n]routine short and take this seriously,[n]please?

[msg MSG_127 [Mitsuru]]
The answer that seems to fit the laws of[n]this world is "X." No one has any[n]objections to this, correct?

[msg MSG_128 [Ribbon]]
THAT IS CORRECT.

[msg MSG_129 [Futaba]]
Poor Ribbon...

[msg MSG_130 [Akechi]]
Now that we have our answer, all that's[n]left is to jump through the gate. Is[n]everyone ready?

[msg MSG_131 [Yosuke]]
No backing down now! Why don't we all go[n]through at the same time?

[msg MSG_132 [Mitsuru]]
Very well. Let's leave the timing to our[n]leader.

[msg MSG_133 [Morgana]]
All right, everybody! Follow Joker!
Once we get past here, the security[n]release switch should be on the other[n]side. Let's knock this exam out!

[msg MSG_134]
Meanwhile, in the "Power" exam room...

[msg MSG_135 [P4 Hero]]
Now that I think about it, wouldn't this[n]be easier if we just put ourselves on[n]the scale?

[msg MSG_136 [Teddie]]
Now that's our Sensei for you! I've been[n]thinking the same thing this entire[n]time!

[msg MSG_137 [Ryuji]]
Don't gimme that bullshit! You looked[n]like you were wetting your suit until[n]like three seconds ago!

[msg MSG_138 [Akihiko]]
Heh... That's pretty good.

[msg MSG_139 [Shinjiro]]
Hey, quit wastin' time chuckling at[n]frivolous shit and line up for the[n]scale!

[msg MSG_140 [Chie]]
Ah―Hang on! Can we, uh... not hop on[n]there one at a time? Please!?

[msg MSG_141]
Meanwhile, in the "Adaptability" exam[n]room...

[msg MSG_142 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I'll go first, so―everyone, just follow[n]my lead!

[msg MSG_143 [Haru]]
Right! I'll do my best!

[msg MSG_144 [Ken]]
Yeah, me too!

[msg MSG_145 [Ann]]
Wow, [f 6 1 27 0 0 0]-chan's really doing a great[n]job.
