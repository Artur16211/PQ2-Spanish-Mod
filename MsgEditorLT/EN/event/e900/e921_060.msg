Allow me to explain the basics[n]ofcommunicating with other worlds[f 0 1 0].
There are countless other worlds that[n]exist parallel to this one...
And indeed, countless parallel versions[n]of yourself. Even now, they seek to[n]contact you from their own worlds.
If you wish to communicate with these[n]other versions of you, you will need the[n][f 0 1 2]P-Book[f 0 1 0].
Your team's information and one[n]Sub-Persona can be included within the[n]P-Book.
When you exchange a Book with another[n]you,[f 0 1 2] you'll both be able to summon the[n]Sub-Personas within the Books[f 0 1 0].
Using this ability will give you the[n]opportunity to obtain powerful[n]Sub-Personas.
Now then, you must decide on a name to[n]differentiate yourself from the other[n]you.
It will be a name for the P-Book... So[n]this shall be known as your [f 0 1 2]P-Book name[f 0 1 0].
You can easily change this later, so set[n]it as whatever you please.
