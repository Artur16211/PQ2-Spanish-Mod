Okay, so lemme explain about how[n]tocommunicate with other worlds[f 0 1 0].
The deal is, there are apparently a ton[n]of worlds besides this one out there.
So, like, in those other worlds, there[n]are other "you"s...
And they're all trying to communicate[n]with your world from theirs.

[msg MSG_000_1 [Marie]]
So if you want to contact this other[n]you, you use the [f 0 1 2]P-Book[f 0 1 0].
The P-Book can hold your team's info and[n]one Sub-Persona.
When you exchange a Book with another[n]you, you'll both be able to summon the[n]Sub-Personas within the Books.
Obviously it'll still cost some money,[n]but you might end up with a really[n]strong Persona.

[msg MSG_000_2 [Marie]]
But first we'll need a name. So the[n]other yous can tell you apart, and[n]stuff.

[msg MSG_000_3 [Marie]]
Hmm... Well, it's a name that goes in[n]the P-Book, so...

[msg MSG_000_4 [Marie]]
Let's call it your [f 0 1 2]P-Book Name[f 0 1 0]!
You can change it whenever, so just give[n]me something to write down.

[msg MSG_001 [Morgana]]
A P-Book Name, huh...

[msg MSG_001_5 [Morgana]]
Why don't we use our Phantom Thieves[n]team name?

[msg MSG_002 [Marie]]
Uh, your what?
