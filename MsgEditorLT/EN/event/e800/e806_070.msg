[msg MSG_000 [Elizabeth]]
Welcome back. I take it you found the[n]ammonite...

[msg MSG_001 [P4 Hero]]
...Yeah, we did, but...

[msg MSG_002 [Makoto]]
They're a little busy right now... Would[n]you mind giving them a moment?

[msg MSG_003 [Elizabeth]]
Busy?

[msg MSG_004 [Yusuke]]
I feel as though I am now one with the[n]ancient world...
I am the ammonite! The ammonite is me!

[msg MSG_005 [Yukiko]]
Absolutely... I know exactly what you[n]mean Yusuke-kun! Viva ammonite!

[msg MSG_006 [Elizabeth]]
......
Please let me know when you are[n]finished.

[msg MSG_007 [Makoto]]
Sorry about this...

[msg MSG_008 [Teddie]]
I'm starting to worry that we've lost[n]the old Yuki-chan for good...

[msg MSG_009 [Haru]]
But aren't you excited to see[n]Yukiko-chan's artwork? She'll finally be[n]able to let her emotions flow.

[msg MSG_010 [Yusuke]]
Phew... I'd say it's not too bad. What[n]about you, Amagi-san?

[msg MSG_011 [Yukiko]]
I drew one too!

[msg MSG_012 [Yusuke]]
Th-This is...!

[sel SEL_013 top]
An explosion.
An ammonite?
I'm not sure...

[msg MSG_014 [Yusuke]]
Yes, an explosion of imagination! A big[n]bang of art!

[msg MSG_015 [Yusuke]]
The ammonite has left―no―burst through[n]its shell... How wonderful!

[msg MSG_016 [Yusuke]]
Indeed. Such creativity has left me[n]speechless as well... It's truly[n]amazing!

[msg MSG_017 [Yukiko]]
No... I just followed your advice,[n]Yusuke-kun.
You taught me to let myself go... I'd[n]never done anything like that before,[n]but...
I never thought it'd feel this good...

[msg MSG_018 [Yusuke]]
No... This was entirely your doing.
...I must thank you.

[msg MSG_019 [Yukiko]]
Huh?

[msg MSG_020 [Yusuke]]
Drawing isn't simply about skill or[n]knowledge...
It is an art born from one's soul―from[n]one's past experiences. It is these[n]things that give rise to creativity...
I had believed I was to teach you, but[n]it appears you ended up teaching me.

[msg MSG_021 [Yukiko]]
Not at all. My art is nothing compared[n]to yours.
If it's okay with you, do you think I[n]could have your picture?
If I'm going to decorate the inn, I want[n]something as expressive as this.

[msg MSG_022 [Yusuke]]
I'm honored to hear that.
And may I ask you to give me your[n]picture, Amagi-san?
I want to remember the feeling of[n]inspiration I had today.

[msg MSG_023 [Yukiko]]
Of course!

[msg MSG_024 [Chie]]
Did you two get to draw your pics?

[msg MSG_025 [Yukiko]]
Yeah! Look!

[msg MSG_026 [Chie]]
Whoa... That's really something...

[msg MSG_027 [Makoto]]
Well, it's... definitely unique, but I[n]think it's also kind of beautiful for[n]that reason.
You two seem to have really connected.

[msg MSG_028 [Teddie]]
By working together, you got a double[n]burst of creativity!

[msg MSG_029 [Yusuke]]
......!

[msg MSG_030 [Yukiko]]
Yusuke-kun...!

[msg MSG_031 [Yusuke]]
Yes...! We may be able to use this in[n]combat!

[msg MSG_032 [Chie]]
Ohh, there they go again.

[msg MSG_033 [Futaba]]
To be on the same wavelength as Inari...[n]She's got some real talent.

[msg MSG_034 [Yusuke]]
I would like to thank everyone.
With this, the Phantom Thieves will now[n]be even more powerful.

[sel SEL_035 top]
We're counting on you.
Sounds good.

[msg MSG_036 [Yusuke]]
Leave it to me.

[msg MSG_037 [Yukiko]]
Oh, that's right. I promised I'd give[n]you something in return.

[msg MSG_038 [Teddie]]
Something in return?

[msg MSG_039 [Yukiko]]
Mhm. I was planning to cook something[n]for Yusuke-kun as a way of saying thank[n]you...

[msg MSG_040 [Chie]]
Why didn't you say so!? I'll help!

[msg MSG_041 [Teddie]]
Th-That's probably...

[msg MSG_042 [Kanji]]
A bad idea. Someone's gonna croak...

[msg MSG_043 [P4 Hero]]
...If you're going to cook something,[n]we'd like to pitch in as well.

[msg MSG_044 [Kanji]]
Y-Yeah! If Yukiko-senpai wants to say[n]thanks, then we'll help too!

[msg MSG_045 [Yusuke]]
Your friends are truly wonderful,[n]Amagi-san.

[msg MSG_046 [Yukiko]]
Yeah! I'll have to work even harder for[n]everyone from here on!
