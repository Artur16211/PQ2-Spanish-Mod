So, Kanji. I hear you want training too?[n]You want to break your limits?

[msg MSG_001 [Kanji]]
Uh... I wanna break SOMEthin', I guess.

[msg MSG_002 [Akihiko]]
All right! Then let's head to the FOE's[n]position!
First, we'll do bunny hops all the way[n]there!

[msg MSG_003 [Junpei]]
At least let us walk! And what do you[n]mean by "first"!?

[msg MSG_004 [Akihiko]]
It's the first part of your training![n]I'm not gonna waste a single[n]opportunity.
Crawling on the ground, running at full[n]speed, walking on our hands... We've got[n]a lot of distance to cover.

[msg MSG_005 [Kanji]]
Hopefully we won't die before we even[n]get to the FOE...

[msg MSG_006 [Akihiko]]
Let's get moving, Joker!
The gong's already rung! Junpei, Kanji,[n]don't fall behind!
