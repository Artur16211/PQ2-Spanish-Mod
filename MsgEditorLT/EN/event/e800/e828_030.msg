Arf, arf!

[msg MSG_001 [Aigis]]
Target located. This must be the broken[n]robot.

[msg MSG_002 [Ken]]
Let's see, it's missing a component,[n]right? I wonder which one...

[msg MSG_003 [Aigis]]
I will take a look. Please wait a[n]moment.

[msg MSG_004 [Aigis]]
It seems to be missing its motor driver.[n]Repairs should be possible once we[n]locate it.

[msg MSG_005 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Okay, so that's all we need? Let's get[n]to it, then!

[msg MSG_006 [Ken]]
This sounds like a job for Koromaru.

[msg MSG_007 [Koromaru]]
Arf, arf!

[msg MSG_008 [Aigis]]
Koromaru-san is indeed very motivated.[n]He says his strong sense of smell will[n]aid us in our search.

[msg MSG_009 [Teddie]]
Now, wait just a minute! I've got a[n]pretty good sense of smell myself, you[n]know!
Witness the power of my all-smelling[n]nose! Let's see...*sniff sniff*
...Ah, this scent! It's coming from[n]Yosuke's pocket!

[msg MSG_010 [Yosuke]]
Hey! That's my gum, you idiot!
Look, just sit down and let Koromaru[n]handle it!

[msg MSG_011 [Teddie]]
Huwah!?

[msg MSG_012 [Koromaru]]
*sniff sniff*
Bark! Bark, bark!

[msg MSG_013 [Aigis]]
He wishes for us to follow him. It seems[n]he's picked up the scent.

[msg MSG_014 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Way to go, Koromaru! We can always count[n]on you!

[msg MSG_015 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_016 [Ken]]
Let's go!
