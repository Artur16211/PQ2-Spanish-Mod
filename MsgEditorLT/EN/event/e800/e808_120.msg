[msg MSG_000 [Naoto]]
Here's the searchlight terminal. Oracle,[n]would you please?

[msg MSG_001 [Futaba]]
Let's see...

[msg MSG_002 [Futaba]]
Sorry, I wasn't expecting this, but it's[n]not connected to the network...
Even if I did hack in here, I still[n]wouldn't be able to find those cars.

[msg MSG_003 [Naoto]]
Hmm, that is a problem. I suppose we'll[n]have to find them on our own.

[sel SEL_004 top]
We have to do something.
Is there another way?

[msg MSG_005 [Futaba]]
Hm? Wait a second... There was another[n]terminal, wasn't there?
Maybe I can access that one. Yeah, let's[n]give it a try.

[msg MSG_006 [Naoto]]
Then, in order to find the police cars,[n]we'll have to find the other terminal.
That or we switch to looking for the[n]cars on our own. We'll leave the[n]decision to you, Joker.

[msg MSG_007 [Futaba]]
This terminal isn't gonna cut it. We'll[n]have to hack the other one.

[msg MSG_008 [Futaba]]
Looks like we don't need this anymore.[n]We already know where the cars are.
