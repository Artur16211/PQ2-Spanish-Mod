Pardon me, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0].
Do you happen to know of this thing[n]that's popular amongst the young and hip[n]called "chu-rros"?

[msg MSG_001 [P3 Fem Protag]]
You mean "churros," like the snack?

[sel SEL_002 top]
No, I don't.
I've heard of them.
I love them.

[msg MSG_003 [Rise]]
Huh? Really?
They're like long, thin donuts covered[n]with cinnamon and sugar!

[msg MSG_004 [Rise]]
So you've never had one before?
They're like long, thin donuts covered[n]with cinnamon and sugar!

[msg MSG_005 [P3 Fem Protag]]
*chuckle* [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]-kun are you a big[n]sweets fan?

[msg MSG_006 [Ann]]
It's crunchy on the outside, super soft[n]on the inside, and jam-packed with[n]sweet, sugary goodness.

[msg MSG_007 [Rise]]
They're so good, and they're really[n]convenient too. It's the perfect snack[n]to take to the movies.

[msg MSG_008 [Elizabeth]]
Ah... So it's just as the rumors say: it[n]enhances the movie-going experience.
I would very much like to taste these[n]"churros"!
Having thought about this, I've ordered[n]Theo to either make me some or draw a[n]knife across his stomach as tribute.

[msg MSG_009 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Ahaha... That's quite an order... Do we[n]have the ingredients?

[msg MSG_010 [Elizabeth]]
I had him gather the ingredients, but[n]he's been whining about there being "one[n]thing missing."
According to him, we need something[n]called "Si-na-mom," which is known for[n]its alluring scent.

[msg MSG_011 [Rise]]
Oh, right, churros do have that cinnamon[n]smell, don't they? Without it, you would[n]feel like something's missing.

[msg MSG_012 [Elizabeth]]
...That said, if you would please offer[n]this pitiable woman your assistance.
I've heard that a plant known as the[n]"Cinnamon Fern" can be found somewhere[n]in the dinosaur movie.
If you wouldn't mind gathering some for[n]me... Not for free of course.

[sel SEL_013 top]
Got it.
Sounds like a drag...

[msg MSG_014 [Ann]]
Yay, it's settled, then! Let's seek out[n]some cinnamon!

[msg MSG_015 [P3 Fem Protag]]
*chuckle* You sound so excited. I bet[n]you're going for the churros.

[msg MSG_016 [Ann]]
Hehe, you got me.
Hot-n-fresh churros sound so good right[n]now!

[msg MSG_017 [Rise]]
Oh, I'm with you guys on this one! I'm[n]gonna be the best navigator I can be!

[msg MSG_018 [Ann]]
Aw, c'mon, Elizabeth needs us. Let's[n]help her out.
Plus, we'll probably get to eat some[n]churros once we're all done, right?

[msg MSG_019 [P3 Fem Protag]]
*chuckle* Is that what you're after,[n]Ann?

[msg MSG_020 [Ann]]
Hehe, you got me.
Hot-n-fresh churros sound so good right[n]now!

[msg MSG_021 [Rise]]
Oh, please say yes, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]-san! I[n]promise I'll be the best navigator I can[n]be!

[msg MSG_022 [Elizabeth]]
I appreciate everyone's kindness.
This may be selfish of me, but I've gone[n]ahead and prepared this as a special[n]screening.

[msg MSG_023 [Rise]]
That was fast!

[msg MSG_024 [Elizabeth]]
And what's more, the locations of the[n]Cinnamon Ferns have already been[n]determined. How incredibly fortuitous.
It may be best if you write them down.

[msg MSG_025]
The Cinnamon Ferns' locations have been[n]added to the map.

[msg MSG_026 [Ann]]
This is perfect. Let's get going!
