It would seem those two caused quite a[n]stir...
This was clearly negligence on Theo's[n]part. Fear not. I shall give him a[n]strict talking-to after this.
Here is your reward for this time.[n]Please accept it.
Excellent work, everyone.

[msg MSG_001 [Akechi]]
This case certainly was interesting.

[msg MSG_002 [Naoto]]
Yes, I agree.
...Seeing the two of them reminded me a[n]little of my old self.

[sel SEL_003 top]
Your old self?
You were like that?

[msg MSG_004 [Naoto]]
Well, I just mean that I understand what[n]it feels like when you can't be honest[n]with yourself.

[msg MSG_005 [Akechi]]
That's unexpected. I'd say you seem much[n]more mature than those two.

[msg MSG_006 [Naoto]]
There was once a time when I tried to[n]suppress who I really was in order to[n]become my ideal self.
It's thanks to my friends that I was[n]able to accept my true self...

[msg MSG_007 [Akechi]]
Your true self, huh...?

[msg MSG_008 [Naoto]]
Akechi-san?

[msg MSG_009 [Akechi]]
Oh, I was just thinking that you've got[n]some wonderful friends. Detectives[n]typically work solo, you know?
I'm glad I was able to team up with you[n]this time around.

[msg MSG_010 [Naoto]]
*chuckle* It was rather thrilling for me[n]as well.
Another Detective Prince... I feel as[n]though working with you will help me[n]sharpen my deductive skills.

[msg MSG_011 [Akechi]]
Indeed. Let's keep working together to[n]see that we all make it home safely.
