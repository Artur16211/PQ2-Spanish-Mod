This special screening concerns the[n]graffiti in the Kamoshidaman movie...
It would seem that one of those drawings[n]has changed drastically.
Your orders this time are to find the[n]drawing that is different from the[n]rest... That is all.

[msg MSG_001 [Makoto]]
When you say graffiti, you mean street[n]art, right?
Are you saying that there's a new one[n]out there somewhere?

[msg MSG_002 [Akechi]]
No. Elizabeth said that one of them has[n]"changed".
That would mean that one of the existing[n]drawings has been overwritten.

[msg MSG_003 [Elizabeth]]
*chuckle* Well done, Detective Prince.[n]Your deductive skills are quite sharp.
In any case, I think it will make more[n]sense once you see it for yourselves.

[msg MSG_004 [Ann]]
That wasn't much of an explanation...

[msg MSG_005 [Yusuke]]
Heh... Heheh... Hahahahaha!

[msg MSG_006 [Futaba]]
Whoa! What's gotten into you, Inari!?

[msg MSG_007 [Yusuke]]
While it goes without saying that this[n]special screening is perfectly suited[n]for me...
This is also a splendid opportunity to[n]introduce everyone to the visual wonders[n]of street art!

[msg MSG_008 [Rise]]
Hmm, it's true we don't see street art[n]that often.

[msg MSG_009 [Yukiko]]
Yeah, you'd cause quite a scene if you[n]tried that in Inaba.

[msg MSG_010 [Yusuke]]
A quest for street art... Heheh... I'm[n]absolutely trembling with excitement!
Urgh, but not yet... It's too soon! Be[n]still, my hand...!

[msg MSG_011 [Futaba]]
Oh, brother... Next thing you know,[n]Inari's gonna open up a third eye.

[msg MSG_012 [Yusuke]]
Either way, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0], allow me to handle[n]this special screening!

[sel SEL_013 top]
It's all you.
I think not.

[msg MSG_014 [Yusuke]]
Of course. Now then, let's be off. Our[n]quest for new inspiration begins!

[msg MSG_015 [Yusuke]]
What...!?
Erk, the shock is too great... I can't[n]stop shaking...!

[msg MSG_016 [Futaba]]
If we don't get going soon, he's gonna[n]summon Dark Inari or something.

[msg MSG_017 [Morgana]]
Sounds good. There's a reward in it, and[n]we can boost our strength too, so why[n]not?

[msg MSG_018 [Makoto]]
So all we have to do is look for some[n]newly-drawn street art?
Okay, let's go, [f 6 1 29 0 0 0]-kun.
