Target sighted! Let him have it!

[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
Y'know, now that I'm seein' that meat,[n]or weapon, or whatever it is again...[n]That thing is freakin' huge.

[msg MSG_002 [Yusuke]]
I knew it. The more I see it, the[n]stronger my curiosity and appetite[n]become.

[msg MSG_003 [Chie]]
Oh man, is that fried chicken? That[n]could feed, like, five―no―ten people!

[msg MSG_004 [Yosuke]]
Hey, hang on, guys. It's too dangerous[n]to just charge in there alone.
We're here too, so don't go takin' it[n]all for yourselves, all right?

[msg MSG_005 [Chie]]
...You're right. We gotta divide it[n]evenly.

[msg MSG_006 [Yosuke]]
I wasn't talking about the meat! I was[n]saying don't take all the glory!

[msg MSG_007 [Kanji]]
Huh? You sound pretty pumped,[n]Yosuke-senpai.

[msg MSG_008 [Yosuke]]
Haha. Yeah, I guess so...
All right, let's bring this guy down!
