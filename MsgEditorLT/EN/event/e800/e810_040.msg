[msg MSG_000 [Ryuji]]
There we go. This should be enough,[n]yeah?

[msg MSG_001 [Morgana]]
Looks like this one's just as fat as the[n]last one we found...

[msg MSG_002]
......!
There's a giant worm on the ground... I[n]should probably get this one too...

[msg MSG_003 [P4 Hero]]
Er...
Sorry about that. You probably found it[n]before me.

[sel SEL_004 top]
All right, I'll take it.
No, go ahead.

[msg MSG_005 [P4 Hero]]
Haha, I suppose it doesn't really matter[n]who picks it up.
Now that I think about it, this is the[n]first time I've ever really talked to[n]you... It feels kind of odd.

[sel SEL_006 top]
Yeah.
It doesn't feel like the first time...

[msg MSG_007 [P4 Hero]]
I wonder why... Could it be because[n]we're both leaders who use Personas?
......

[msg MSG_008 [Kanji]]
Yo, we got a ton of bait. Now we just[n]need to reel in that fiâ€•
Why're you two glarin' at each other[n]like that!?

[msg MSG_009 [Teddie]]
Two people staring intensely at one[n]another... They call this...

[sel SEL_010 top]
Having a Third Eye.
A duel.
Falling in love.

[msg MSG_011 [Ryuji]]
That's just you, man.
For real, though, what's with the[n]staredown? You two tryna finish what you[n]started back when you first met?

[msg MSG_012 [Ryuji]]
Seriously!? You two tryna finish what[n]you started back when you first met?

[msg MSG_013 [P4 Hero]]
This feeling in my chest... Is that what[n]this is?

[msg MSG_014 [Yosuke]]
Can't one of you take this seriously...?

[msg MSG_015 [P4 Hero]]
We were going to talk leader-to-leader,[n]but we couldn't think of anything to[n]say.

[msg MSG_016 [Kanji]]
Huh, that's unlike you, Senpai.

[msg MSG_017 [Naoto]]
It's possible that you two understand[n]each other so well, no words are[n]necessary.

[msg MSG_018 [Ann]]
Now that you mention it, they do seem[n]alike.

[msg MSG_019 [P4 Hero]]
Do you think we're alike, Joker?

[sel SEL_020 top]
Yeah.
No.
Big bro...

[msg MSG_021 [P4 Hero]]
Hm...

[msg MSG_022 [P4 Hero]]
Right.

[msg MSG_023 [Ann]]
Case in point!

[msg MSG_024 [P4 Hero]]
Oh... Little bro!

[msg MSG_025 [Teddie]]
Oookay, that's enough! Sensei already[n]has his pretty little sister!

[msg MSG_026 [Yosuke]]
Well, they do both kinda do their own[n]thing...

[msg MSG_027 [Yukiko]]
Oh! And they both look good in glasses!

[msg MSG_028 [Teddie]]
They also both like fishing!

[msg MSG_029 [P4 Hero]]
Fishing...
Ah, that's right. We found another giant[n]worm.

[msg MSG_030 [Teddie]]
Aaahh!

[msg MSG_031 [Haru]]
Wow! We're sure to catch a big one with[n]this!

[msg MSG_032 [P4 Hero]]
Now that we have our bait, let's go[n]catch that fish.

[sel SEL_033 top]
Let's go.
Let's get fishin'!

[msg MSG_034 [Ryuji]]
Heh! We're gonna be the ones to catch[n]that thing, right, Joker!?

[msg MSG_035 [Kanji]]
Like some old-ass fish has any chance of[n]gettin' away from our Senpai!

[msg MSG_036 [Yukiko]]
...Maybe it's because of those two.

[msg MSG_037 [Yusuke]]
Amagi-san, what's wrong?

[msg MSG_038 [Yukiko]]
Oh, it's nothing. An ancient fish,[n]hm...? Maybe we should make sashimi.

[msg MSG_039 [Yusuke]]
Sashimi... Music to my ears. It sounds[n]amazing, and I'm sure it'll taste[n]amazing too.
There's no time to waste! Off we go!
