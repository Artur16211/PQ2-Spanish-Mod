[msg MSG_000 [Haru]]
Oh, you guys...

[msg MSG_001 [Akechi]]
What is this...?

[sel SEL_002 top]
Is he dead...!?
Who did this?
Did Akechi do it?

[msg MSG_003 [Haru]]
He was like this when I found him...

[msg MSG_004 [Akechi]]
Hold on a minute. I only just arrived.

[msg MSG_005 [Haru]]
I was just passing by a moment ago when[n]I found him like this...

[msg MSG_006 [Morgana]]
Teddie... I may not have liked[n]everything about you, but you weren't[n]such a bad guy...

[msg MSG_007 [Naoto]]
Oh, um... He's not dead. He just took[n]off his costume...

[msg MSG_008 [Morgana]]
What? Talk about misleading...
And why's it full of popcorn crumbs...?

[msg MSG_009 [Haru]]
Hm? So if this is just the costume, then[n]where is the real Teddie?

[msg MSG_010 [Chie]]
Heeey!

[msg MSG_011 [Yukiko]]
Have any of you seen Teddie?

[msg MSG_012 [Naoto]]
Actually, we're looking for him too.
It seems he left his bear costume here[n]and went somewhere else.

[msg MSG_013 [Chie]]
What are you thinking, Teddie...?

[msg MSG_014 [Akechi]]
Did something happen?

[msg MSG_015 [Chie]]
Well, we were just hanging out in the[n]lobby, eating some of Theo's new[n]popcorn...
Actually, it might be better if you just[n]see for yourself. You mind?

[sel SEL_016 top]
Let's go.
Time to investigate the crime scene.

[msg MSG_017 [Naoto]]
I sense a case in the making.

[msg MSG_018 [Akechi]]
Indeed. Let's go.
