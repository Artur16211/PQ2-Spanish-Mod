All right, we're halfway there! We[n]should be finished soon if we keep this[n]pace.

[msg MSG_001 [Makoto]]
Yeah, I'm definitely warmed up now.[n]Let's get this done quick.

[msg MSG_002 [Ryuji]]
Yo, do Queen and Noir look a bit more[n]geared up than usual?

[sel SEL_003 top]
Now that you mention it...
They look the same to me.

[msg MSG_004 [Ann]]
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing!
They seem really motivated, like they're[n]bursting with energy or something.

[msg MSG_005 [Ann]]
Hmm. They're usually pretty serious, but[n]they look even more so today...
Don't they seem, I dunno... motivated?[n]Like they're bursting with energy or[n]something?

[msg MSG_006 [Morgana]]
Hmm... It is a little strange.
I doubt they'd go on a rampage like[n]Skull would, but they do seem more[n]driven than before.

[msg MSG_007 [Ryuji]]
Hey! I'm right here, cat.

[msg MSG_008 [Morgana]]
Anyway, it might be a good idea to keep[n]an eye on them, Joker.

[msg MSG_009 [Makoto]]
Um... Any reason you guys are staring at[n]us and whispering to each other?

[msg MSG_010 [Morgana]]
Huh? O-Oh, uh, it's nothing. We were[n]just noticing how motivated you two are.

[msg MSG_011 [Teddie]]
Yeah, it was nothing.
He was just worried that you two were so[n]motivated, you might go on a rampage!

[msg MSG_012 [Morgana]]
Don't just blurt that out!

[msg MSG_013 [Makoto]]
...Now I get it. Hehe, sorry to worry[n]you.
I'm fine, though. I don't plan on going[n]crazy or anything.

[msg MSG_014 [Haru]]
Mhm, I'm okay too. I'm just really in[n]the mood to move around right now.
I was feeling pretty cramped after being[n]tied up for so long. This should be just[n]what I need.

[msg MSG_015 [Kanji]]
You two are really goin' for it! I'm[n]with you!

[msg MSG_016 [Teddie]]
Ooh! Me too! I'll show everyone just how[n]extraordin-bear-y I can be!

[msg MSG_017 [Morgana]]
Good grief... Well, I'm glad everyone's[n]motivated, but try not to overdo it, all[n]right?
