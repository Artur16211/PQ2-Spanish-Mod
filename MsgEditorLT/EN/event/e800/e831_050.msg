[msg MSG_000 [Ryuji]]
Yo, you see that sign? There's a[n]shit-ton of people here too.

[msg MSG_001 [Yusuke]]
This place looks quite popular. This[n]must be it.

[msg MSG_002 [P3 Hero]]
Well, Elizabeth said all we needed to do[n]was find the place, so it looks like[n]we're done here.
Let's―

[msg MSG_003 [Junpei]]
Hold up! You wanna go home!?
We came this far, and you don't even[n]wanna see what it's like!?

[msg MSG_004 [Teddie]]
That's right! Sometimes a bear's gotta[n]fight for his right to party!
And with that... Charge!

[msg MSG_005 [Junpei]]
Hey, that ain't fair! Don't rush in by[n]yourself!

[msg MSG_006 [Yosuke]]
H-Hey! Guys!

[msg MSG_007 [Teddie]]
It was no use... The guard wouldn't let[n]me in...

[msg MSG_008 [Shinjiro]]
It's VIP only. We probably need some[n]kinda membership or something.

[msg MSG_009 [Teddie]]
No... It's not VIP only.

[msg MSG_010 [Yosuke]]
Huh? Then, why couldn't you get in?

[msg MSG_011 [Junpei]]
Guys can't get in on their own.
Security says guys can only come in if[n]they got girls with 'em.

[msg MSG_012 [Teddie]]
It's a harsh world for us lonely boys...

[msg MSG_013 [Junpei]]
I'm not lonely! Dammit... If only I had[n]my sweet Chidorita...
This calls for drastic measures. If we[n]ask our lovely ladies for help, I'm sure[n]we―

[msg MSG_014 [Yukari]]
Nope.

[msg MSG_015 [Mitsuru]]
*sigh* You're going to use us? And you[n]call yourself a gentleman...

[msg MSG_016 [Junpei]]
Ugh... I wanna become an adult. Let me[n]be one...

[msg MSG_016_1 [Kanji]]
You can start by not bein' such a[n]baby... C'mon, let's go back.

[msg MSG_016_2 [Teddie]]
Hmm... Wait! We have professionals with[n]us! Maybe they can help!
Masters of the night! Teach us your[n]ways! Please!

[msg MSG_017 [P3 Hero]]
Our ways...?
Any idea how we can trick security?

[sel SEL_018 top]
Cross dressing?
Find some girls?
A bribe?

[msg MSG_019 [Teddie]]
Ah! That's a great idea! If there are no[n]girls, then I shall become one!
Why, you'd be out of your mind not to[n]fall for this pretty face of mine!

[msg MSG_020 [Yosuke]]
Nah, there's no way that's going to...

[msg MSG_021 [Kanji]]
Uhhh, Teddie's gone, dude...

[msg MSG_022 [Teddie]]
Yeah! There's an idea! We go schmooze[n]some pretty, pretty, pretties, and[n]bingo―we're in!

[msg MSG_023 [Yosuke]]
Like any girl would agree to come along[n]with us. Let's just...

[msg MSG_024 [Kanji]]
Uhhh, Teddie's gone, dude...

[msg MSG_025 [Teddie]]
Oh-hoh... A little under-the-table[n]action, you say? You really are a bad[n]boy.

[msg MSG_026 [Yosuke]]
Well, what the heck are we supposed to[n]bribe 'em with?

[msg MSG_027 [Teddie]]
I may not have money inside me, but I do[n]have candy.
I'll get 'em with a half-eaten candy[n]surprise!

[msg MSG_028 [Teddie]]
It didn't work!

[msg MSG_029 [Junpei]]
Duh! They thought you were comin' on to[n]them!

[msg MSG_030 [Yosuke]]
Crap, we've got company!

[msg MSG_031 [P3 Hero]]
Are those... Shadows!? Guess it's a[n]fight, then.

[sel SEL_032 top]
Let's do it.
We do it together.

[msg MSG_033 [P3 Hero]]
Right, we can take them. Let's go!
