Excellent work out there, everyone.
I saw everything from the big screen.[n]You found the graffiti in question[n]without any trouble whatsoever.
Amidst that work of art was a small[n]glimpse of change... How terribly[n]fascinating.
It would seem words are not the only[n]form of expressing oneself. I'm rather[n]impressed by this revelation.
Thank you for allowing me to indulge in[n]such a wonderful screening. Allow me to[n]prepare your reward.
I'll give it to you in due time. Please[n]make good use of it.

What's up, Inari? Your hand getting out[n]of control again?

[msg MSG_003 [Yusuke]]
No. It's just that this latest special[n]screening has given much to think about.

[msg MSG_004 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Really? I kinda thought you had it all[n]figured out, Yusuke-kun!

[msg MSG_005 [Yusuke]]
I believed defeating Kamoshidaman would[n]have some sort of effect on the people's[n]thinking, but...
I had also believed that the movie would[n]only continue as long as we were[n]changing it.
After we left, I assumed time there[n]would stop.

[msg MSG_006 [Morgana]]
Actually, I was thinking the same thing.
Once it was all over, I didn't think[n]there'd be any more to it.

[msg MSG_007 [Yusuke]]
But after seeing that graffiti, I[n]realized that wasn't the case.
Even without our influence, the movie[n]will continue to change.
Those people have become independent,[n]and now they've started acting of their[n]own will.
It's no ordinary film. It's a living[n]entity... Wouldn't you agree?

[sel SEL_008 top]
I feel you.
You're exaggerating.
My hand, it trembles...

[msg MSG_009 [Makoto]]
A living entity, huh...? That's[n]certainly a different take on it.
I never imagined some simple graffiti[n]would broaden my views so greatly.

[msg MSG_010 [Makoto]]
Yeah, it's a little difficult to imagine[n]that the movie's actually alive.
Still, it does seem fitting... I[n]definitely see things differently now.
I never imagined some simple graffiti[n]would broaden my views so greatly.

[msg MSG_011 [Yusuke]]
Hah... You too? Having touched the art[n]of another, my hand refuses to settle[n]down.
Erk... No! Now that I'm thinking about[n]it, I'm losing control again!
I long to give shape to these feelings[n]welling within me...! Ahh, if only I had[n]a brush and a canvas right now!

[msg MSG_012 [Futaba]]
Hey, you mind not triggering Inari like[n]that? Now we're gonna have to wait for[n]him to settle down.

[msg MSG_013 [Ryuji]]
You got that right. It'll be pretty[n]interesting to see how this movie[n]changes from here on out.

[msg MSG_014 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I won't claim that we're serving justice[n]or anything... but I'm happy if we've[n]given those people a chance to change.
Ahh, how exciting! I think my hand is[n]starting to shake too!

[msg MSG_015 [Ann]]
All right, enough of that joke, or we're[n]all gonna start acting like Yusuke.
Let's just hope that all of the other[n]movies change for the better like this[n]one did!
