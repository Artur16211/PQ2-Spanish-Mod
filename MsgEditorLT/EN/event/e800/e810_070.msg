[msg MSG_000 [Elizabeth]]
This is definitely the fish I requested.
I must say, your fishing techniques were[n]truly a sight to behold.
I suppose I should've expected as much[n]from those with the power of the wild[n]card.

[msg MSG_001 [Kanji]]
You two were awesome... Guess you showed[n]us what being a leader is all about.

[msg MSG_002 [Ryuji]]
Yeah, your group's leader was just as[n]cool as ours!

[msg MSG_003 [Akechi]]
They both have the sort of charisma that[n]brings people together... I imagine[n]that's why they're so similar.

[msg MSG_004 [Yukiko]]
Mhm, you just get the feeling that[n]everything's going to be okay when[n]you're with your leader.

[msg MSG_005 [Ann]]
Yeah! I feel at ease knowing that he's[n]got my back.

[msg MSG_006 [P4 Hero]]
Agreed. I felt the same from during the[n]special screening.

[sel SEL_007 top]
Charisma?
The power of the wild card?

[msg MSG_008 [P4 Hero]]
No, nothing like that.
I just felt like you really would do[n]something reckless if it was for your[n]friends.
Why else would you challenge a swordsman[n]with nothing but a model gun?

[sel SEL_009 top]
I had to do something.
Sorry for any hard feelings.

[msg MSG_010 [P4 Hero]]
Yeah. All I could think about was[n]protecting my friends.
It's the same for you, isn't it?
You want to protect those who depend on[n]you... I can feel it.

[msg MSG_011 [P4 Hero]]
No, I'm sorry too.
I was just desperate to protect my[n]friends. I'm sure it was the same for[n]you.
You want to protect those who depend on[n]you... I can feel it.

[sel SEL_012 top]
You're right.
I guess we are pretty alike.

[msg MSG_013 [P4 Hero]]
I see...
I'm glad I was able to meet someone who[n]feels the same way I do.
Let's work together from hereon. As[n]friends.

[sel SEL_014 top]
Right.
Of course.

[msg MSG_015 [Futaba]]
Oh? It's like the two of them have gone[n]into super friendship mode!

[msg MSG_016 [Kanji]]
No kidding... The two of you guys[n]together are, like, Level 99 or some[n]shit...

[msg MSG_017 [P4 Hero]]
No... It's 530,000.

[msg MSG_018 [Yosuke]]
What the heck are you guys talking[n]about!?
Well, either way... If you two work[n]together, you got nothing to fear.

[msg MSG_019 [Morgana]]
I bet the two of you are gonna be even[n]stronger now!
