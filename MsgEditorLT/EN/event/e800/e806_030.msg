[msg MSG_000 [Rise]]
Oh! I'm sensing some water close by. You[n]guys are almost there!

[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
Yo, are we really gonna find one of[n]those ammonite things here? They lived[n]in the ocean, didn't they?

[msg MSG_002 [Makoto]]
That's right. Supposedly, ammonites[n]lived at the bottom of the ocean.
It's been said that fossils have been[n]found in rivers and lakes that were once[n]a part of the ocean.

[msg MSG_003 [Yusuke]]
Ahh. We'll be able to dig up the ancient[n]world with our own hands... This will[n]surely arouse my creativity!

[msg MSG_004 [Chie]]
Um... Is Fox always like this?

[sel SEL_005 top]
Pretty much.
He's more calm than usual.

[msg MSG_006 [Futaba]]
Actually, he's not so bad right now.
I mean, the other day he wanted to hike[n]Mt. Fuji just so he could paint the[n]sunrise.

[msg MSG_007 [Chie]]
Seriously!?

[msg MSG_008 [Futaba]]
Yeah, pretty much.
I mean, the other day he wanted to hike[n]to Mt. Fuji just so he could paint the[n]sunrise.

[msg MSG_009 [Haru]]
Yeah... At least we were able to stop[n]him from going up there in just his[n]uniform.

[msg MSG_010 [Ryuji]]
Normally, he plays it cool, but when he[n]gets like this, there's no tellin' what[n]he might do...
Dude's a real fool for art. He just[n]doesn't know how to hold himself back.

[msg MSG_011 [Yusuke]]
A fool, you say? I'll have you know, I[n]have far better grades than you...

[msg MSG_012 [Ryuji]]
That's not what I'm sayin'! Don't go[n]dissin' me like that!

[msg MSG_013 [Yukiko]]
Doesn't know how to hold himself back,[n]huh...? Honestly, I'm a little jealous.

[msg MSG_014 [Chie]]
Yukiko...

[msg MSG_015 [Yukiko]]
I've always tried to act proper and live[n]up to everyone's expectations.
Maybe it's showing up in my pictures[n]too.

[msg MSG_016 [Yusuke]]
So that's what it was... Don't worry,[n]Amagi-san.
The passion you hold in your heart is[n]real.
I will help you bare it all! Now, go![n]Expose yourself to the world!

[sel SEL_017 top]
Let's stop here.
Maybe hold yourself back.
Help! Police!

[msg MSG_018 [Makoto]]
Fox... May I speak with you for a[n]moment?

[msg MSG_019 [Yusuke]]
I-I'm only trying to teach Amagi-san the[n]wonders of art...

[msg MSG_020 [Chie]]
Yeah, yeah, tell it to the judge.

[msg MSG_021 [Futaba]]
Forgetting about the weirdo for now,[n]we're almost there! Keep going!
