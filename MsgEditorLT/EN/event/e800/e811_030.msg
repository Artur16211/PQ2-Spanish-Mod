There! Seidoptera dead ahead!

[msg MSG_001 [Teddie]]
It's so fearsome...
That beak looks like it could tear[n]Yosuke clean in two...

[msg MSG_002 [Yosuke]]
You mind not sayin' stuff like that!? I[n]can't get the image outta my head now!

[msg MSG_003 [Morgana]]
Look, there's a Treasure Spot over[n]there!

[msg MSG_004 [Akechi]]
That seems like the best place to hide[n]one's treasure... It's probably worth[n]investigating.

[msg MSG_005 [Morgana]]
It looks like the Seidoptera follows a[n]fixed path.
Take it slow and watch for an opening.[n]Remember, you can always back off if[n]things don't look good.

[msg MSG_006 [Chie]]
Aw man, I'm getting nervous...

[msg MSG_007 [Futaba]]
Don't worry, Joker's with you! We're[n]counting on you to get that treasure!
