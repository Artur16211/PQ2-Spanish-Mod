Hwataaa!
...You're already dead. Just kidding.

[msg MSG_001 [Kanji]]
Hell yeah, Senpai! That last move was[n]badass!

[msg MSG_002 [Chie]]
Nah, it was nothing special.

[msg MSG_003 [Yosuke]]
If anyone was special, it was Panther.[n]Where'd you learn how to do that?

[msg MSG_004 [Ann]]
Uh, I dunno. I just went with the flow[n]and tried to copy Chie-chan...

[msg MSG_005 [Chie]]
No, no, you've definitely got what it[n]takes for kung fu! I'm sure of it!
You just need to put a little more heart[n]into it!

[msg MSG_006 [Ann]]
L-Like this?

[msg MSG_007 [Chie]]
You gotta twist your hips more! Try to[n]picture the Rising Dragon in your mind!

[msg MSG_008 [Ann]]
Y-Yes, Master!

[msg MSG_009 [Yosuke]]
Since when did those two become master[n]and student...?

[sel SEL_010 top]
That's one passionate friendship.
She's been converted.
Take care of Panther.

[msg MSG_011 [P4 Hero]]
Yeah. Picturesque as an ocean sunset.

[msg MSG_012 [Yosuke]]
No comment.

[msg MSG_013 [Yosuke]]
Yeah... Sorry about that.

[msg MSG_014 [P4 Hero]]
Leave it to us. She'll be a kung fu[n]master in no time.

[msg MSG_015 [Yosuke]]
Dude, we're not running a dojo here...

[msg MSG_016 [Futaba]]
Hey, how long do you guys plan on[n]standing around?
Our mission's complete. Save it for[n]after we get back.

[msg MSG_017 [Chie]]
Oh yeah, good call.

[msg MSG_018 [Ann]]
Whoops, sorry. Okay, let's go!
