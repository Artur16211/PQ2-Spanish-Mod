Thus ends the showdown... It was a[n]thrilling battle that will surely go[n]down in ursine history.

[msg MSG_000_1 [Elizabeth]]
And Teddie... I am truly glad you were[n]able to fulfill your wish.

[msg MSG_001 [Teddie]]
I'm the best! Announcing the Bear[n]Supreme, the Ursa Major, the one bear to[n]rule them all!

[sel SEL_002 top]
Congrats.
That title will be mine...

[msg MSG_003 [Teddie]]
Thank you! It's all because you helped[n]my wish come true!

[msg MSG_004 [Teddie]]
Aha... A challenger appears, eh!? I'll[n]take you on whenever you want!

[msg MSG_005 [Yosuke]]
Dude, if that's what it'll take for you[n]to chill out, I'm rooting for him.

[msg MSG_006 [Hikari]]
But the way you stood up to that big,[n]strong enemy without any fear... You[n]looked really cool, Teddie.

[msg MSG_007 [Teddie]]
That's because I AM cool. And 'cause I[n]had all my friends backing me up!

[msg MSG_008 [Yosuke]]
Man, now he's got a big head... We'll[n]never hear the end of this.

[msg MSG_009 [Hikari]]
*giggle* Well, if Teddie's become the[n]best bear, then it's all thanks to his[n]best friends.
