So this zappy gate will let us recreate[n]that flavor?

[msg MSG_001 [Naoto]]
Well, the gate's open at the moment.[n]Let's come back after it's closed.

[msg MSG_002 [Teddie]]
So this zappy gate will let us recreate[n]that flavor?

[msg MSG_003 [Naoto]]
Yes. Let's not waste any time.

[msg MSG_004 [Akechi]]
It's done.

[msg MSG_005 [Teddie]]
Allow me to taste it...
Hm? Mmm!?
HWOOOOOOAAA!!!

[msg MSG_006 [Yukiko]]
Huh? You sound like an actual bear! Are[n]you okay, Teddie!?

[msg MSG_007 [Teddie]]
There it is! That feeling of a lightning[n]bolt bear-reling right through my skull![n]It tastes just like Theodore's popcorn!

[msg MSG_008 [Yosuke]]
Alriiight! Let's get this over to[n]Theodore.

[msg MSG_009 [Chie]]
Okay, let's go.

[msg MSG_010 [Teddie]]
Say...

[msg MSG_011 [Akechi]]
Hm? What is it?

[msg MSG_012 [Teddie]]
Who was the culprit? Is it one of us...?

[sel SEL_013 top]
Yes.
No.

[msg MSG_014 [Naoto]]
No, it's not one of us.

[msg MSG_015 [Akechi]]
And while we're on the subject, the[n]navigators are clean too.

[msg MSG_016 [Naoto]]
Oh, so you noticed?
That's right. None of us are guilty.

[msg MSG_017 [Akechi]]
And while we're on the subject, the[n]navigators are clean too.

[msg MSG_018 [Teddie]]
R-Really!?

[msg MSG_019 [Naoto]]
Considering the culprit was after the[n]popcorn, I'd say that rules us out[n]because we could just ask for our own.

[msg MSG_021 [Naoto]]
Let's go over the rest of what we know.
The culprit went out of their way to[n]steal popcorn they could have easily[n]asked for.
At the time of the incident, the culprit[n]was disguised as Teddie and was seen[n]stumbling around.

[msg MSG_022 [Akechi]]
Now then, Joker. Do you know who was[n]disguising themselves as Teddie?

[sel SEL_023 top]
Elizabeth.
Theodore.
Margaret.
Marie.
Caroline.
Justine.

[msg MSG_024 [Akechi]]
I see. So that's who you had in mind.
Well, you'll know if you're right soon[n]enough.

[msg MSG_025 [Naoto]]
Shall we head back, then?
