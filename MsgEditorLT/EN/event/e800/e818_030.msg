[msg MSG_000 [Junpei]]
Ta-dah da-da-daaah! Junpei obtained a[n]rare item!

[msg MSG_001 [P3 Fem Protag]]
This is going a lot smoother than I[n]expected. I guess it won't be too hard[n]with all of us here.

[msg MSG_002 [Morgana]]
Phantom Thieves times three, huh...?[n]Though, at this point, I don't feel much[n]like a thief.

[sel SEL_003 top]
That's 3x the attack power.
That means 1/3 the screen time...

[msg MSG_004 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Exactly. Imagine how much easier[n]climbing Tartarus would be with this[n]many people.

[msg MSG_005 [Junpei]]
Yeah, but I'd be worried about leavin'[n]someone behind every time we went up to[n]the next floor.

[msg MSG_006 [P3 Fem Protag]]
That's what you're worried about!?

[msg MSG_007 [Junpei]]
No, he's right. Junpei fans all over the[n]world are gonna be real disappointed.

[msg MSG_008 [Yukari]]
What're you talking about? Even's lost[n]faith in you.

[msg MSG_009 [P3 Fem Protag]]
......

[msg MSG_010 [Junpei]]
No kidding. She's speechless!

[msg MSG_011 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Sorry... It's just that I'm feeling[n]really emotional right now.

[msg MSG_012 [Yukari]]
Huh? Which part of that made you[n]emotional?

[msg MSG_013 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Well, I was just thinking that, no[n]matter which time or space I'm in,[n]Junpei's still just as silly as ever.

[msg MSG_014 [Junpei]]
Now you're dissin' me!?

[msg MSG_015 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Ahaha, don't think too hard about it![n]C'mon, let's find the next enemy!

[msg MSG_016 [Junpei]]
Hey! Hang on a second!

[msg MSG_017 [Yukari]]
What are they doing...?

[msg MSG_018 [Fuuka]]
*giggle* I think it's Junpei-kun's way[n]of being considerate.

[sel SEL_019 top]
Yeah.
How?

[msg MSG_020 [Yukari]]
He probably wanted to make sure didn't[n]feel uncomfortable.

[msg MSG_021 [Fuuka]]
-chan was laughing.

[msg MSG_022 [Fuuka]]
He was trying to help-chan feel more at[n]home.

[msg MSG_023 [Yukari]]
That Junpei... Always trying to help.

[msg MSG_024 [Fuuka]]
But I think it's helping her open up a[n]bit.
Now then, shall we get going? Our next[n]destination is 3-F.

[msg MSG_025 [Yukari]]
Got it. We don't wanna fall behind[n]Junpei, do we?

[msg MSG_026 [Fuuka]]
But I think it's helping her open up a[n]bit.
Now then, shall we get going? Our next[n]destination is 4-B.

[msg MSG_027 [Yukari]]
Got it. We don't wanna fall behind[n]Junpei, do we?

[msg MSG_028 [Fuuka]]
But I think it's helping her open up a[n]bit.
Now then, shall we get going? Our next[n]destination is either 4-B or 3-F.

[msg MSG_029 [Yukari]]
Got it. We don't wanna fall behind[n]Junpei, do we?
