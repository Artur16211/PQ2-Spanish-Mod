[msg MSG_000 [Rise]]
Oh! Welcome back!
Listen up, everyone. Theodore's made a[n]new kind of popcorn!

[msg MSG_001 [Yusuke]]
Popcorn... Just hearing the word is[n]making my stomach rumble.

[msg MSG_002 [Theodore]]
I've been waiting, everyone.
I believe I've outdone myself on this[n]latest creation. By all means, please[n]try some.

[msg MSG_003 [Haru]]
Wow, it's so colorful! You don't see[n]food that looks like that everyday.
Mmm, and it smells amazing too!

[msg MSG_004 [Yusuke]]
Well then, don't mind if I do...
......!?
Wh-What is this...!?

[msg MSG_005 [Futaba]]
Wha―What's wrong!? Why'd you freeze up[n]all of a sudden!?

[msg MSG_006 [Yusuke]]

[msg MSG_007 [Naoto]]
Could it be poisonous!? Spit it out,[n]quickly!

[msg MSG_008 [Ryuji]]
Is it really that dangerous!?

[msg MSG_009 [Yusuke]]
Yes, it is indeed dangerous...[n]Dangerously delicious!

[msg MSG_010 [Haru]]
Oh wow, you're right about it being[n]charged. I could eat this all day.

[msg MSG_011 [Morgana]]
...Seriously?

[msg MSG_012 [Yukiko]]
Hmm, this sounds interesting. Let me try[n]some, Theodore!

[msg MSG_013 [Ann]]
Oh, me too!

[msg MSG_014]
Everyone's trying the new popcorn...

[msg MSG_015 [Morgana]]
Girls are always more adventurous in[n]times like this...

[sel SEL_016 top]
Let's try some.
Let's wait and see.

[msg MSG_017 [Morgana]]
Y-Yeah. Us guys need to step it up.

[msg MSG_018 [Morgana]]
I know how you feel, but us guys should[n]step it up.

[msg MSG_019 [Theodore]]
Ah, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]...
My apologies, but I've just run out of[n]popcorn.

[msg MSG_020 [Morgana]]
Already!? That was barely any!

[msg MSG_021 [Theodore]]
I am truly sorry for the inconvenience.
I had some slight difficulty obtaining[n]the ingredients to produce that[n]flavor...

[msg MSG_022 [Akechi]]
Difficulty?

[msg MSG_023 [Theodore]]
Yes. I discovered a secret deep within[n]the jungle...
There, I was able to make use of a[n]certain something that helped give the[n]final product its charge.

[msg MSG_024 [Rise]]
I'm not sure what you're talking about,[n]but it sounds like a lot of work...
Well, we've got plenty here, so we can[n]split it between everyone once we get[n]back to the lobby.

[msg MSG_025 [Yusuke]]
Could I have some as well, Kujikawa-san?

[msg MSG_026 [Ann]]
Haven't you had some already!?

[msg MSG_027 [Theodore]]
I will need to restock the ingredients[n]at some point...

[msg MSG_028]
A new special screening: "Theodore's[n]Special Popcorn" has been added to the[n]box office.
