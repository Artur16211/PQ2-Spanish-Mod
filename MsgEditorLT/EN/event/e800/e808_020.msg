We have to find those police officers[n]first. Let's go see what they have to[n]say!

[sel SEL_001 top]
Why're you here?
It's dangerous here.

[msg MSG_002 [Futaba]]
I-I'm sorry... This one looked fun, so I[n]thought I'd tag along.
I won't bother you guys! Please let me[n]go with you!

[msg MSG_003 [Morgana]]
That shouldn't be a problem, right?[n]She's usually with us anyway.

[msg MSG_004 [Futaba]]
Oh, look! There's our first suspect!

[msg MSG_005 [Makoto]]
...But with how we're dressed, it might[n]be hard for us to speak with them.

[msg MSG_006 [Naoto]]
Please allow me to handle this.

[msg MSG_007 [Naoto]]
Excuse me, may I ask you something?
Is it true there's a fake police officer[n]causing a disturbance around here?

[msg MSG_008 [Fat Policeman]]
Who're you? Where'd you hear that?

[msg MSG_009 [Naoto]]
Oh, it's just a rumor... But as a[n]citizen I would appreciate some[n]information.

[msg MSG_010 [Fat Policeman]]
Hm, of course. It's important to share[n]this kind of info with the public.
The fake officer is riding in a car[n]marked with double 1s.
Please report to us if you find them.[n]They're very dangerous, so be sure not[n]to get too close.

[msg MSG_011 [Naoto]]
Thank you for the information. You be[n]careful as well.

[msg MSG_012 [Futaba]]
Whoa, that was fast. Nice work,[n]Detective.

[msg MSG_013 [Naoto]]
We'll have to find the other police[n]officers and gather more information.

[msg MSG_014 [Yusuke]]
"The fake officer is riding in a car[n]marked with double 1s."
...So this is our lead?

[msg MSG_015 [Naoto]]
It's not all we've learned.
The officer we interviewed drove a car[n]marked with the numbers "77-55."
Let's keep this in mind as well. It[n]should help provide us with an answer.

[msg MSG_016 [Futaba]]
Don't worry! I'll be sure to remember[n]it!

[msg MSG_017 [Morgana]]
All right! Let's keep up the search!

[msg MSG_018 [Naoto]]
Kamo City certainly is big...
We'd best mark the officers' locations[n]on the map.

[msg MSG_019 [Futaba]]
Okay, Skull! Where're those cops at?

[msg MSG_020 [Ryuji]]
Why you askin' me?

[sel SEL_021 top]
Maybe at the station?
Perhaps another crime scene?
Let's look for their cars.

[msg MSG_022 [Ryuji]]
I dunno where we're gonna find that. I[n]did see some police cars, though...

[msg MSG_023 [Futaba]]
That's right! There were police cars[n]around here!

[msg MSG_024 [Futaba]]
There you go! Good thinking, Joker!
There were some police cars around here![n]Maybe we'll find some nearby.

[msg MSG_025 [Naoto]]
Then, let's search the area. With any[n]luck, we'll find them soon.

[msg MSG_026 [Futaba]]
Oh, I know!
If you wanna know where the police cars[n]are, just ask me!

[msg MSG_027 [Naoto]]
That would be very helpful. But what[n]exactly do you plan to do?

[msg MSG_028 [Futaba]]
If I can hack into the city's computer[n]system, we'll know exactly where to find[n]'em.
They used a terminal to control the[n]searchlights, right? I'll hack in from[n]there. Heheheh.

[msg MSG_029 [Morgana]]
You know, you scare me sometimes...

[msg MSG_030 [Naoto]]
Let's think of a strategy, then.
If we want to speak to the police[n]officers, we'll need to first locate the[n]police cars.
And if we want to know where the police[n]cars are, we'll need to find a[n]searchlight terminal.

[sel SEL_031 top]
Got it.
Let's get going.

[msg MSG_032 [Naoto]]
We can either look for the cars on our[n]own or head to a searchlight terminal.[n]We'll leave it up to you, Joker.
Let's get started, shall we?

[msg MSG_033 [Futaba]]
Roger that! This is gonna be fun! It's[n]time to investigate!

[msg MSG_034]
He said the fake officer's in the car[n]with double 1s...
