Now then, let's get to gathering those[n]ingredients, shall we?
All we need are Tingly Kernels, isn't[n]that right?

[msg MSG_001 [Naoto]]
Yes, but it wouldn't be wise to search[n]blindly.
Theodore gave us a tip on where to find[n]some...

[sel SEL_002 top]
Bright places.
Windy places.
Damp places.

[msg MSG_003 [Teddie]]
Oh? He said that?

[msg MSG_004 [Akechi]]
No, he said we should look somewhere[n]damp.
In which case, we should probably[n]concentrate our search near bodies of[n]water.

[msg MSG_005 [Naoto]]
Yes, he mentioned searching in damp[n]locations.
In which case, we'll want to concentrate[n]our search near bodies of water.

[msg MSG_006 [Teddie]]
By the way, why do we need the popcorn?

[msg MSG_007 [Akechi]]
We currently only have circumstantial[n]evidence, so we have no choice but to[n]catch the culprit in the act.

[msg MSG_008 [Naoto]]
Therefore, we'll ask Theodore to make[n]his new popcorn again...
And we'll use that as bait to lure in[n]the culprit, correct?

[msg MSG_009 [Akechi]]
Yes. Plus, no one will suspect anything;[n]they'll think we're just trying to help[n]Theodore.

[msg MSG_010 [Teddie]]
Hrrm... How bear-y clever.

[msg MSG_011 [Akechi]]
*chuckle* You're too kind.

[msg MSG_012 [Naoto]]
We'll find Tingly Kernels near the[n]water. Let's begin our search.
