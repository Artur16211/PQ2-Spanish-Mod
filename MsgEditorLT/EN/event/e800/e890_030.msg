Well, everyone, the time has finally[n]come.
You've acquired four pieces of film.
Of those, three have regained their[n]shine, and only one remains sooty...

[msg MSG_001 [Naoto]]
So, once we display our ability to one[n]last arbiter of power...

[msg MSG_002 [Akechi]]
's power of the wild card will change[n]somehow.

[msg MSG_003 [Yosuke]]

[msg MSG_004 [Makoto]]
Loosely speaking, I suppose that's about[n]right...

[msg MSG_005 [Elizabeth]]
Now then! Answer the following!

[msg MSG_006 [Fuuka]]
Aah! You surprised me...

[msg MSG_008 [Yukari]]
Uh, what's she getting all worked up[n]about? Does she even need to ask?

[msg MSG_009 [Junpei]]
Nah, I think this one's more about the[n]showmanship.

[msg MSG_010 [Elizabeth]]
I can't hear you! Anyone?

Then, let us go to the Velvet Room, and[n]we shall―
...Ah, but before that...

[msg MSG_014 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Huh...? Where's she going?
Is that the Kamoshidaman sign? What's[n]she doing over there...?

[msg MSG_015 [Naoto]]
Retrieving something from behind it,[n]apparently.

[msg MSG_016 [Junpei]]
Hot dogs...? Wait, that's where she was[n]hiding hers!?
Whoa. She's just... gonna eat 'em all[n]right now, huh.

[msg MSG_017 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Oh, she's coming back...

[msg MSG_018 [Elizabeth]]
Pardon my stepping away. I am now fully[n]charged and ready to fight!

I need a bit more time.

[msg MSG_024 [Elizabeth]]
Understood. Then let us move to a more[n]suitable location.

[msg MSG_025 [Elizabeth]]
Understood. I shall wait for as long as[n]you require.
