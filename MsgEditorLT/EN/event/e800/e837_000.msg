Whew, we've covered a lot of ground. I[n]think a break would do us good―

[msg MSG_001 [Makoto]]
W-What!? An earthquake? Are we under[n]attack?

[msg MSG_002 [Chie]]
Here goes! The Satonaka-style secret[n]art... Dragon Kiiick!

[msg MSG_003 [Akihiko]]
Not bad! But too slow!

[msg MSG_004 [Chie]]
You're amazing, Master! You were so[n]fast, I didn't even see you move!

[msg MSG_005 [Akihiko]]
You've got a pretty amazing kick[n]yourself, Chie. If I'd taken that head-[n]on, I would've been sent flying.

[msg MSG_006 [Makoto]]
What are you two doing!?

[msg MSG_007 [Akihiko]]
Nothing to worry about! Just doing some[n]training. A little mock battle to get[n]the blood pumping.

[sel SEL_008 top]
Someone'll get hurt...
Now that's diligence.

[msg MSG_009 [Chie]]
Don't sweat it. We're used to this!

[msg MSG_010 [Makoto]]
You may be used to this, but I'M not...

[msg MSG_011 [Makoto]]
I'm glad to see you so proactive, but do[n]you really need to train all the way out[n]here?

[msg MSG_012 [Akihiko]]
Huh... Maybe we overdid it a little, but[n]I just couldn't contain myself.

[msg MSG_013 [Chie]]
Heheh, I know what you mean. You gotta[n]eat well, and fight well. That's how you[n]become the strongest!

[msg MSG_014 [Makoto]]
Is this all you two ever―I mean, do you[n]always train this hard?

[msg MSG_015 [Chie]]
Hmm, my usual routine is to do some[n]running, then I practice my kicks...[n]Finally, I wrap up with a beef bowl!

[msg MSG_016 [Akihiko]]
Yeah. You gotta launch your body into a[n]tough workout, then seal the deal with a[n]healthy bite of protein.

[msg MSG_017 [Makoto]]
*sigh*
Recklessly swinging at each other isn't[n]training. You have to think about[n]training your mind, too.
The same applies to your diet. You can't[n]just eat protein and nothing else. You[n]have to think about balance.

[msg MSG_018 [Akihiko]]
Oh, that's right! You practice aikido,[n]right, Queen? Well, I can't deny the[n]insight of a fellow fistfighter...

[msg MSG_019 [Makoto]]
So I'm part of this now, too, am I...?

[msg MSG_020 [Chie]]
...Oh! I just had a totally great idea![n]What if Queen comes up with a new[n]training course for us?

[msg MSG_021 [Akihiko]]
Good point. If we train the same way all[n]the time, we'll get too used to it. Can[n]you help us, Queen?

[sel SEL_022 top]
Give it a try.
You can do it.
Sounds like fun.

[msg MSG_023 [Makoto]]
I suppose I could...
But if I'm going to do that, I need to[n]gauge everyone's strength so I can come[n]up with realistic milestones...

[msg MSG_024 [Makoto]]
Oh, not you too... Though I suppose I[n]wouldn't mind teaching you.
But if I'm going to do that, I need to[n]gauge everyone's strength so I can come[n]up with realistic milestones...

[msg MSG_025 [Makoto]]
Is this really the time to say that?[n]Well, I suppose I don't mind teaching[n]you...
But if I'm going to do that, I need to[n]gauge everyone's strength so I can come[n]up with realistic milestones...

[msg MSG_026 [Haru]]
Oh, Queen! Mitsuru-san says we should[n]head out soon.

[msg MSG_027 [Makoto]]
Okay, we should get going for now. We[n]can discuss your regimen another time.

[msg MSG_028 [Chie]]
You got it, Coach!

[msg MSG_029 [Makoto]]
...Coach?
Um, okay then... Let's go.
