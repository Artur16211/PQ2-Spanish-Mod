Ch-Chie-chan!

[msg MSG_001 [Chie]]
Whoa! Y-You scared me...
What's up?

[msg MSG_002 [Ann]]
Er, um... This might sound kinda weird,[n]asking this out of nowhere, but...
Can you teach me kung fu!?

[msg MSG_003 [Chie]]
Kung fu? I guess I could... Wait!
Ann-chan, are you a kung fu movie buff[n]too!?
Oh, oh, oh! What's your favorite Trial[n]of the Dragon? It's hard to choose,[n]but... I think mine's the first one.

[msg MSG_004 [Ann]]
...Trial of the Dragon? Sorry, I don't[n]really know what that is.
I was just watching you fight, and I[n]thought you looked really cool...

[msg MSG_005 [Chie]]
C-Cool!? Me!?
No way! You're way cooler than me,[n]Ann-chan. How do I get a body like[n]yours? Is it your diet?
Do you eat meat? Please tell me you eat[n]meat and not just a bunch of leaves...

[msg MSG_006 [Ann]]
Leaves...?
Well, I guess diet is important, but I[n]also really like stuff with whipped[n]cream...

[msg MSG_007 [Chie]]
Then, do you work out?
Oh, I get it! Yeah, you Phantom Thieves[n]are always zipping around like crazy!

[msg MSG_008 [Ann]]
Yeah, that's true. I guess I do get[n]pretty worn out from that...

[msg MSG_009 [Chie]]
I knew it!
Okay, how about you teach me to move[n]like you do?

[msg MSG_010 [Ann]]
Huh!?

[msg MSG_011 [Chie]]
And, in return, I'll teach you kung fu.
That way, we'll both learn each other's[n]secrets to being cool. What do you[n]think?

[sel SEL_012 top]
Sounds like fun.
It's a deal.

[msg MSG_013 [Chie]]
-kun!? When did you get here!?

[msg MSG_014 [Ann]]
Umm, he's been here the whole time...
Anyway, if that's all you want to know,[n]then I'd be happy to teach you!

[msg MSG_015 [Chie]]
Ooh, that sounds so phantom thief-y...[n]So cool...

[msg MSG_016 [Ann]]
Hehe. Looks like we're both getting what[n]we want.
If that's all you want to know, then I'd[n]be happy to teach you!

[msg MSG_017 [Chie]]
All right, so in exchange for me[n]teaching you kung fu...

[msg MSG_018 [Ann]]
I'll teach you how to move like a[n]phantom thief. It's a deal!

[msg MSG_019 [Chie]]
Okay, where should we practice? The only[n]real way to learn this stuff is to go[n]out and do it...

[msg MSG_020 [Yosuke]]
Heyyy! Elizabeth says she's got a new[n]special screening.

[msg MSG_021 [Chie]]
Got iiit! We'll be right over!
We can figure the rest out later, okay?

[msg MSG_022]
A new special screening: "Kung Fu[n]Catwalk!" has been added to the box[n]office.
