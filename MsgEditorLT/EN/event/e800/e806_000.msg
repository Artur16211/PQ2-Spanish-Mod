Yusuke-kun, you study art, right?
If you don't mind, do you think you[n]could give me some drawing tips?

[msg MSG_001 [Yusuke]]
Are you interested in art as well,[n]Amagi-san?

[msg MSG_002 [Yukiko]]
Mhm. I was thinking I could put it on[n]display at our inn... What do you think?

[sel SEL_003 top]
Good idea.
It might draw in customers.
Why don't you help her out?

[msg MSG_004 [Yusuke]]
Hm. Something drawn by the manager[n]herself might help the inn grow more[n]popular.
Very well. I am still in training, but[n]if it's all right with you, then I[n]accept.

[msg MSG_005 [Yukiko]]
Thank you!
...So what do we do now?

[msg MSG_006 [Yusuke]]
First, I'd like to know what kind of[n]picture you wish to draw.
You may use whatever you like as a[n]motif.

[msg MSG_007 [Yukiko]]
Got it!

[msg MSG_008 [Yukiko]]
What do you think?

[sel SEL_009 top]
Looks good.
Looks good enough to eat.

[msg MSG_010 [Yusuke]]
It's not bad at all, and...
It perfectly encapsulates the natural[n]beauty of its curved shape. You've quite[n]the eye.

[msg MSG_011 [Yusuke]]
You're right. I must admit it's starting[n]to make me hungry...

[msg MSG_012 [Yukiko]]
Shrimp are great, aren't they? They're[n]delicious, and they're fun to look at!
You can make any parfait look gorgeous[n]just by placing a few shrimp on top.

[msg MSG_013 [Yusuke]]
A shrimp parfait? I suppose there are[n]still many dishes I've yet to learn[n]about...
As for your drawing...
Amagi-san... Might you be holding[n]yourself back?

[msg MSG_014 [Yukiko]]
Whaâ€•!?

[msg MSG_015 [Yusuke]]
It's by no means a bad picture, but this[n]shrimp seems somewhat restricted...

[msg MSG_016 [Yukiko]]
Restricted...?

[msg MSG_017 [Yusuke]]
Release your inner self! Let your pencil[n]guide you!
Now, face the shrimp again! What does it[n]mean to you!?

[msg MSG_018 [Yukiko]]
Huh!? Face the shrimp? What does it mean[n]to me...?

[msg MSG_019 [Yukiko]]
Sh-Shrimp... Shrimp...
Shrimp, shrimp... SHRIMP!

[msg MSG_019_02 [Yusuke]]
Yes... That's the look! That's the[n]feeling! Put it all on the canvas!

[msg MSG_020 [Yukiko]]
Right! I'll try!

[msg MSG_021 [Yusuke]]
Th-This is...!

[msg MSG_022 [Yukiko]]
Wh-What do you think? I feel like I was[n]really able to capture the essence of[n]the shrimp...

[sel SEL_023 top]
That's a shrimp?
You have quite a knack for this.
I don't follow...

[msg MSG_024 [Yusuke]]
H-How could this be... To think I called[n]myself an artist!

[msg MSG_025 [Yukiko]]
Huh? I-Is it bad?

[msg MSG_026 [Yusuke]]
Bad!? Quite the opposite! I can feel[n]your passion! This shrimp defies all[n]expectation!
I want to see more of your art,[n]Amagi-san!

[msg MSG_027 [Yukiko]]
That's nice of you to say, but I don't[n]know what else to draw...

[msg MSG_028 [Yusuke]]
I see... So you need a motif that's just[n]as moving as the shrimp?

[msg MSG_029 [Yukiko]]
Huh? Um... Yeah.

[msg MSG_030 [Yusuke]]
Then, I will find it for you. When I do,[n]I'd like you to sketch for me again!

[msg MSG_031 [Futaba]]
Heeey! I heard there's a new ticket[n]available.
Hm? What're you smirking at, Inari?[n]Anyway, let's go!

[msg MSG_032]
A new special screening: "Inspiration[n]Investigation!" has been added to the[n]box office.
