So the goal is to defeat eight Basalts,[n]right?
There's not much else to go on, so I[n]guess we should just do what we always[n]do?

[sel SEL_001 top]
Let's make this quick.
Let's take our time.

[msg MSG_002 [Futaba]]
Hm? Hang on a second, Joker!
I'm picking up more FOE signals than[n]usual.
Not only that, but the Basalts seem to[n]be hangin' around awfully close to them.

[msg MSG_003 [P4 Hero]]
Could that be one of the changes that[n]happens during a special screening...?

[msg MSG_004 [Futaba]]
Looks like it. And I think normal[n]pathways might be blocked off too.

[msg MSG_005 [Akechi]]
I see... It's like a short film version[n]of the labyrinth that lets us reach our[n]goal quickly.

[msg MSG_006 [Haru]]
You said the Basalts are gathered near[n]the FOEs, isn't that right?

[msg MSG_007 [Makoto]]
That means we'll achieve our goal faster[n]if we head toward them.
It's risky, but it's probably the most[n]efficient plan.

[msg MSG_008 [Futaba]]
FOEs are tough, though.
We'll leave it up to Joker to decide,[n]just like always! We're counting on you,[n]Joker!
