[msg MSG_001 [Morgana]]
How about it? Did you come up with a[n]regimen for Chie and Akihiko?

[msg MSG_002 [Makoto]]
Well, the thing is... I can't actually[n]find any weaknesses in either of them...

[sel SEL_003 top]
Isn't that a good thing?
They're pretty strong.

[msg MSG_004 [Makoto]]
Yes. They're both so strong already. Why[n]push themselves so hard?

[msg MSG_005 [Chie]]
Coach! Is something wrong?

[msg MSG_006 [Akihiko]]
You see anything missing in our[n]performance? Don't hesitateâ€• just tell[n]me straight.

[msg MSG_007 [Makoto]]
Well, not really...

[sel SEL_008 top]
Queen has a question.
What drives you?

[msg MSG_009 [Makoto]]
Joker... Thanks.

[msg MSG_010 [Makoto]]
Thanks.

[msg MSG_011 [Makoto]]
From what I can tell, you're both[n]already so strong. But you're so fixated[n]on getting even stronger...
Tell me, why do you two push yourselves[n]so hard?

[msg MSG_012 [Chie]]
What's driving me to get stronger?[n]Well...

[msg MSG_013 [Akihiko]]
Because I want to beat even stronger[n]opponents.

[msg MSG_014 [Makoto]]
Huh?

[msg MSG_015 [Chie]]
The stronger we are, the more bad guys[n]we can beat! It's the same for you,[n]right, Coach?

[msg MSG_016 [Akihiko]]
Yeah. Isn't that why you learned aikido?[n]You had something you needed to fight,[n]right?

[msg MSG_017 [Makoto]]
Well... My father was a policeman, so he[n]taught me and my sister aikido.
So it kind of just happened that way for[n]me. And I'm not as strong as my father[n]or my sister...

[sel SEL_018 top]
You aren't?
Sae-san's even stronger?

[msg MSG_019 [Makoto]]
There's always someone stronger. And my[n]father was one of the best.
...Though maybe he's a little bigger in[n]my memory than he was in life.

[msg MSG_020 [Makoto]]
I haven't sparred with her in awhile, so[n]I'm not sure, but I never managed to[n]beat her before.

[msg MSG_021 [Chie]]
Whoa, your dad was a police officer...?[n]That's so cool...

[msg MSG_022 [Akihiko]]
I'm sure he was a great man.
But you don't have to be so modest. Your[n]strength isn't just in your raw power.
You can calmly analyze a situation, then[n]make calculated decisions. That's[n]something we can't do.

[msg MSG_023 [Chie]]
Then let's have her come up with a[n]training regimen for us! Like a workout[n]for our minds?
Oh, but how are we supposed to train our[n]brains?

[msg MSG_024 [Makoto]]
Brain training, huh? *chuckle* You're[n]both so true to your goals.
Once you have that reason to be[n]strong...

[msg MSG_025 [Futaba]]
Sorry to interrupt, but I'm detecting a[n]lot of Shadows gathering up.
You guys better skedaddle.

[msg MSG_026 [Morgana]]
Save the talk for later. Let's go,[n]Joker!
