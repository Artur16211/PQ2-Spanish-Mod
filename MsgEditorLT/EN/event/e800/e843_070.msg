An out-of-control cart careens toward[n]the doomed workers! But at the last[n]moment, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0] decides their fate!
...Perhaps it was only two questions,[n]but they may have shown great insight[n]into your hearts.
While this was a bit of a departure from[n]the usual special screenings, I enjoyed[n]it nonetheless.

[msg MSG_001 [Futaba]]
But who made those signs in the first[n]place? And what about the spooky[n]announcer lady?

[msg MSG_002 [Junpei]]
Actually, now that I think of it, that[n]sexy voice was kinda familiar...
Ring any bells for you, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]?

[sel SEL_003 top]
No idea.
Elizabeth?
It WAS familiar...

[msg MSG_004 [Junpei]]
Man, but my Babe Radar is going wild!
Someone real sexy, real mature, with[n]that kinda sophisticated aura to her...

[msg MSG_005 [Elizabeth]]
Most unfortunately, it was not me.
I am more likely to be found in my seat[n]during screenings, devouring popcorn and[n]hot dogs with wild abandon.

[msg MSG_006 [P4 Hero]]
I'm glad you enjoyed the show, as usual.

[msg MSG_007 [Junpei]]
Nah, I get the feeling it's someone[n]older and more mature than Elizabeth...

[msg MSG_008 [Junpei]]
I know, right? And it felt like it was[n]someone super recent, like just after we[n]got to this theater.
Someone real sexy, real mature, with[n]that kinda sophisticated aura to her...

[msg MSG_009 [Elizabeth]]
We may never know the truth. But as for[n]my speculation on the orchestrator's[n]motives...
I believe she was intrigued by you, and[n]was driven by a desire to better[n]understand you all.

[msg MSG_010 [P4 Hero]]
Well, I can only hope she got what she[n]wanted out of it.

[msg MSG_011 [Elizabeth]]
Who can say?
I expect she will continue observing[n]your exploits in the trials to come.
In any case, it was a most entertaining[n]show. Please continue to keep up the[n]good work.
