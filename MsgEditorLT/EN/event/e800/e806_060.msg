Third time's the charm! We got this!

[msg MSG_001 [Kanji]]
Yeah! Let's do it!

[msg MSG_002 [Yusuke]]
Hm!? Could this be...!?

[msg MSG_003 [Ryuji]]
Oh! You find one!?

[msg MSG_004 [Yusuke]]
No, just this strange grass. Is this[n]some type of seaweed?
Perhaps I'll try a bite...

[msg MSG_005 [Ryuji]]
Dude, no way! That'll wreck your[n]stomach!

[msg MSG_006 [Naoto]]
Seaweed? That would mean...

[msg MSG_007 [Yukiko]]
Fox! Look at this...!

[msg MSG_008 [Kanji]]
More seaweed?

[msg MSG_009 [Yusuke]]
No! Look! It's an actual ammonite!

[msg MSG_010 [Yukiko]]
Wow! I've never seen a real one before![n]They really do exist!

[msg MSG_011 [Naoto]]
This must be seawater.
It's likely the water here was once part[n]of the ocean before the shape of the[n]land changed.

I must be lucky...

[msg MSG_013 [Ryuji]]
Don't even think about eatin' it...

[msg MSG_014 [Yusuke]]
Why would I eat it? Are you feeling all[n]right, Skull?

[msg MSG_015 [Ryuji]]
Uh, yeah... Sorry 'bout that.

[msg MSG_016 [Rise]]
Mission accomplished! Come on back,[n]everyone!

[msg MSG_017 [Yusuke]]
Ohh, I simply cannot wait to capture[n]this emotion I'm feeling right now!

[msg MSG_018 [Yukiko]]
Mhm! Me too! I think now I'll finally be[n]able to draw without holding anything[n]back!

[msg MSG_019 [Morgana]]
...Well, there you have it. Let's go,[n]Joker.
