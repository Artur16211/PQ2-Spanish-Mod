[msg MSG_000 [Margaret]]
Hmhm... And so I have lost.
I felt your power resound through my[n]whole body. I never guessed you'd excite[n]me this much...

[sel SEL_001 top]
Thank you.
That was a tough battle.
That was fun.

[msg MSG_002 [Margaret]]
No... if anyone deserves thanks, it is[n]you. I had a wonderful time.

[msg MSG_003 [Margaret]]
*chuckle* I'm honored to hear it. I hope[n]you took at least some enjoyment from[n]it.

[msg MSG_004 [Margaret]]
Yes, indeed... So much so that it's a[n]pity that it's over.

[msg MSG_005 [Elizabeth]]
Well done, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]. Now, what of the[n]film...?

[msg MSG_006]
The film that looked sooty is now[n]glowing faintly...

[msg MSG_007 [Teddie]]
Whoaaa, this one's all shiny now! That[n]means we did it!

[msg MSG_008]
......!
The two pieces of film are shining[n]brighter together now...

[msg MSG_009 [P4 Hero]]
What's happening...?
Are they resonating with each other...?

[msg MSG_010]
The glow quietly ebbed away...

[msg MSG_011 [Rise]]
Huh? It's back to how it was...

[msg MSG_012 [Akechi]]
But there was a clear reaction between[n]the two of them.

[msg MSG_013 [Naoto]]
Yes. I think we can conclude that[n]gathering and activating more of this[n]film is bound to have some effect.

[msg MSG_014 [Margaret]]
Hmhm... I'm glad if I could help.
I think I will also watch closely, to[n]see the possibilities of the wild card[n]for myself.

[msg MSG_015 [Elizabeth]]
I'm pleased that things are going[n]smoothly.
Now, we shall wait until we acquire[n]another ticket specifying its cast.

[msg MSG_016 [Naoto]]
Still, this is all fairly mysterious.[n]I've been wondering myself...
What could be the purpose of these[n]special screenings? What is generating[n]them?

[msg MSG_017 [Akechi]]
It's true, these screenings seem oddly[n]suited to our circumstances.

[msg MSG_018 [Yukiko]]
...Do you think... someone's watching[n]us?

[msg MSG_019 [Yukari]]
Gah! Yukiko-chan, you don't have to say[n]it like that...

[msg MSG_020 [Margaret]]
Ha... Perhaps you'd be better off not[n]thinking too hard about it.
As you proceed through these various[n]movies, you will continue to grow as a[n]matter of course.

[msg MSG_020_1 [Margaret]]
And so, you will find budding new[n]possibilities, granting you the power to[n]define your own fate...

[msg MSG_020_2 [Margaret]]
Cherish that fact, so that you will[n]never falter on your path.

[sel SEL_021 top]
I'll try.
Not sure I get it.

[msg MSG_022 [Margaret]]
Yes, I hope you do so. If you feel[n]you've lost your way, come and see me.

[msg MSG_023 [Margaret]]
*chuckle* Just keep doing what you've[n]always done. If you feel you've lost[n]your way, come and see me.

[msg MSG_024 [Elizabeth]]
Now then, since you've successfully made[n]my sister cry mercy, I have wonderful[n]news for you.

[msg MSG_025 [Margaret]]
Hmhm... I could hardly let you leave[n]empty-handed, after you've provided such[n]a stimulating diversion.
You've done so much to thrill me, it's[n]only fair that I give you a reward in[n]kind...

[msg MSG_026 [Yosuke]]
Whoa, seriously!?
Wh-When she says it like that... Oh man,[n]I've been waiting for this kinda reward[n]my whole life!

[msg MSG_027 [Chie]]
Whatever you're thinking, it's not that.[n]The only reward you're getting is a[n]swift kick in the butt.

[msg MSG_028 [Margaret]]
I hope it'll meet your expectations.[n]Make sure to pick it up from Elizabeth[n]later.
It's an item that should help you[n]further refine your power. I hope you[n]make good use of it.

[msg MSG_029 [Elizabeth]]
Well then, I believe that draws our[n]efforts to a close! Please visit again[n]if you―

[msg MSG_030 [Margaret]]
A moment, Elizabeth.
There should be another reward for them.[n]Hand it to them at once.

[msg MSG_031 [Futaba]]
Oooh! We got a one-more!

[msg MSG_032 [Elizabeth]]
......
My! I had, as they say, plumb forgotten.[n]I suppose it slipped my mind while I was[n]watching the battle.
Naturally, it was purely an accident,[n]and not a devious attempt to pilfer it[n]during the long conversations.
Now, please accept this.

[msg MSG_033 [Yosuke]]
...Uh...?

[msg MSG_034 [Makoto]]
...This is... another hot dog.

[msg MSG_035 [P4 Hero]]
We got one when we faced Theodore too. I[n]guess hot dogs are a pretty big deal[n]here...?

[msg MSG_036 [Margaret]]
Ah, I suppose that's understandable.
They are impressively tasty for one of[n]Theo's creations. I hear he puts great[n]time and effort into them.
Indeed, it gets to the point that we[n]fight over each one. Even Elizabeth is[n]partial to them, aren't you?

[msg MSG_037 [Elizabeth]]
Yes, I must say I'm surprised Theo[n]managed this. Truly, they are the[n]greatest treasure of this domain.

[msg MSG_038 [Margaret]]
...Hm, I have less on hand than I[n]thought... It's about time Theo made[n]another batch.

[msg MSG_039 [Elizabeth]]
Ah, seeing it in person only makes me[n]want one more! Truly, it is the hottest[n]of all possible dogs.
With a little threateni―that is to say,[n]polite reminding, I'm sure he will make[n]me some more.
Well then... farewell!

[msg MSG_040 [Margaret]]
Ah...!
Come back here, Elizabeth! My order must[n]be made first!

[msg PERSONA_STOCK_UP_MSG]
Overcoming this ordeal has strengthened[n]the power of the wild card. Your Persona[n]stock has increased by .
