I am most unsatisfied with your results.
Your goal was to "gather" the[n]ingredients, but it appears you went[n]ahead and cooked them...
Thanks to your selfishness, I sat here[n]half-starved.
Now my hunger is so intense, I'm fraught[n]with an ever-swelling urge to DESTROY[n]EVERYTHING!

[msg MSG_001 [Akihiko]]
We've got leftover ingredients. Shinji[n]can probably make something for you.

[msg MSG_002 [Shinjiro]]
The hell!? Don't volunteer me like[n]that...

[msg MSG_003 [Elizabeth]]
I suppose it can be arranged.
Very well. I'll wait for this feast[n]until the end of days if I must!

[msg MSG_003_05 [Shinjiro]]
Sheesh... This ain't gonna be easy.

[msg MSG_004 [Yusuke]]
It's rather peculiar, but I feel[n]significantly more powerful after eating[n]Aragaki-san's cooking.

[msg MSG_005 [Shinjiro]]
It's probably because you're full.

[msg MSG_006 [Yusuke]]
Indeed. Full of inspiration! What an[n]uplifting sensation!

[msg MSG_007 [Akihiko]]
You know what they say: you can't fight[n]on an empty stomach.
The only way to take on the really tough[n]opponents is with training and a proper[n]diet.

[msg MSG_008 [Shinjiro]]
Said it once, I'll say it twice: can it[n]with the protein, will ya?

[msg MSG_009 [Akihiko]]
Giving us protein's like giving wings to[n]a tiger. It's a match made in heaven.

[msg MSG_010 [Shinjiro]]
You little... What did I just say!?

[msg MSG_011 [Yusuke]]
Hmm, he has a point. That meal was[n]absolute perfection!
Perhaps I can channel this feeling into[n]my combat routine.

[msg MSG_012 [Akihiko]]
Yeah! We'll take some protein alongside[n]Shinji's meal and go in for the kill![n]It'll be great!

[msg MSG_013 [Shinjiro]]
These two are somethin' else...
Well, if you guys're hungry, I don't[n]mind cooking for you again...
But if I catch you puttin' that protein[n]shit on everything, there'll be hell to[n]pay, got it?

[msg MSG_014 [Yusuke]]
Understood... We'll just have to eat it[n]on our own time. Very well, then! Good[n]food and protein it is!

[msg MSG_015 [Akihiko]]
Sounds like a plan!
