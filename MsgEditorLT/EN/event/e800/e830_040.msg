Hey, we got two more warp spots over[n]here. Which do we take?

[msg MSG_001 [Ann]]
I got it! It's the one to the left!

[msg MSG_002 [Makoto]]
You seem certain, Panther. Did you[n]figure out the hint?

[msg MSG_003 [Ann]]
Nope! I've just got a hunch, that's all.
Actually, I just remembered I saw on TV[n]that Scorpio was the most lucky sign for[n]today.
And Scorpio's lucky color was blue. So[n]the blue warp spot is definitely the way[n]to go!

[msg MSG_004 [Ann]]
Um... or not.
Eheheh... I guess that's kinda flimsy.

[msg MSG_005 [Akechi]]
Which one do you think is right,[n]Aragaki-kun?

[msg MSG_006 [Shinjiro]]
Huh? How the hell should I know?

[msg MSG_007 [Akechi]]
Haha... No reason in particular.
Joker makes the final call anyway. I[n]suppose I just wanted your opinion for[n]reference.

[msg MSG_008 [Shinjiro]]
......
No idea.
For all we know, both of 'em are wrong.

[msg MSG_009 [Akechi]]
Hahaha, true enough...
If we do get this wrong, I hope we get a[n]chance to go back and make the right[n]choice.
