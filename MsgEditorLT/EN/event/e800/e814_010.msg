A new special screening has been added.[n]It concerns...
Finding a poor, young dinosaur and its[n]mother.

[msg MSG_001 [Futaba]]
It got separated from its mom?

[msg MSG_002 [Elizabeth]]
The family was attacked by a predator.[n]They managed to survive, but...
The young one was wounded and separated[n]from its mother.
Please help the dinosaur and its mother.

[msg MSG_003 [Kanji]]
If it's wounded and separated from its[n]family, we'll wanna hurry, yeah?

[msg MSG_004 [Haru]]
It's probably really lonely right now...
I'm sure it's scared and doesn't know[n]what to do.

[msg MSG_005 [Yukiko]]
Haru-san...
Yeah, I want to help it too. What do you[n]think, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]-kun?

[sel SEL_006 top]
Let's go right now.
I feel the same way.

[msg MSG_007 [Ann]]
Okay then, let's get going!
