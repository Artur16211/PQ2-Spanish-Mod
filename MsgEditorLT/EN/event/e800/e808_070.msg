It seems that's all of the hints we're[n]going to get for the time being.
Oracle, let's compare the data we've[n]acquired thus far.

[msg MSG_001 [Futaba]]
All right! Write it down if you need to.

[msg MSG_002 [Futaba]]
So the first officer said...
"The fake officer is riding in a car[n]marked with double 1s."
His car's numbered 77-55.

[msg MSG_003 [Futaba]]
And the second one...
"The officer with the car numbered 77-55[n]is real."
He's in car 11-10.

[msg MSG_004 [Futaba]]
Third one says...
"The officer in the car with double 4s[n]is real."
His car is 11-22.

[msg MSG_005 [Futaba]]
Fourth one...
"The officer with double 7s is acting[n]suspicious."
The number on his car was 44-11.

[msg MSG_006 [Futaba]]
And finally there's the fifth one...
"The officer by car number 11-10 seems[n]suspicious to me."
His numbers are 11-77. Crit fails and[n]lucky sevens.

[msg MSG_007 [Futaba]]
That's all we got! Wanna hear it again?

[sel SEL_008 top]
Please.
I'm good.

[msg MSG_009 [Futaba]]
Roger! Pay attention now.

[msg MSG_010 [Futaba]]
Okay! On to the thinking phase! Take it[n]away, Detective!

[msg MSG_011 [Naoto]]
The main point here is that only one of[n]them is lying.
We need to compare these testimonies and[n]highlight any suspects who violate our[n]rule that "there is only one liar."
Therefore, we simply need to test which[n]testimony is our one lie, and see if the[n]remaining testimonies hold true.

[msg MSG_012 [Futaba]]
How 'bout it, Joker? You figure out who[n]the liar is?

[sel SEL_013 top]
Officer 77-55.
Officer 11-10.
Officer 11-22.
Officer 44-11.
Officer 11-77.

[msg MSG_014 [Naoto]]
The officer by the car numbered 77-55,[n]correct?

[msg MSG_015 [Futaba]]
That one was near the starting point.

[msg MSG_016 [Naoto]]
The officer who was by car 11-10, you[n]say?

[msg MSG_017 [Futaba]]
That one was a little south of where we[n]started!

[msg MSG_018 [Naoto]]
So the officer with the car numbered[n]11-22?

[msg MSG_019 [Futaba]]
He was a little south from the starting[n]point, just before a turn.

[msg MSG_020 [Naoto]]
The officer with the car numbered 44-11,[n]is that right?

[msg MSG_021 [Futaba]]
I think he was... near the middle of the[n]map, by a Treasure Spot.

[msg MSG_022 [Naoto]]
The officer with car 11-77?

[msg MSG_023 [Futaba]]
He's in an open area on the west side.

[msg MSG_024 [Naoto]]
All right, let's go.
If you're correct, we'll probably be met[n]with a fight. Make sure we're ready.
