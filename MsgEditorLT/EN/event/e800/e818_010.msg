The goal of this next special screening[n]is to collect three types of materials.
Now, if our material specialist would[n]please describe the materials in[n]detail... Theo! Theo, where are you!?
Theo, get out here, or so help me, I[n]will fill your popcorn machine with[n]soybean powder andâ€•

[msg MSG_001 [Theodore]]
I-I'm here! How can I help you, Sister?

[msg MSG_002 [Elizabeth]]
Describe to them the required materials.

[msg MSG_003 [Theodore]]
Certainly. The Phantom Mage will drop[n]the Teddy Bear.
The Flowing Sand will drop the[n]Kaleidoscope...
And the Clay Figurine you can obtain[n]from the Rampage Drive.

[msg MSG_004 [Elizabeth]]
These are all rare parts of a Shadow...[n]We'd like you to extract them.

[msg MSG_005 [Junpei]]
Rare materials...? What a drag...

[msg MSG_006 [Theodore]]
Please refrain from saying such things[n]and accept this screening!

[sel SEL_007 top]
You're awfully enthusiastic.
What's wrong?
No.

[msg MSG_008 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Yeah, what's going on?

[msg MSG_009 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Mmhm, you seem stressed. Everything[n]okay?

[msg MSG_010 [Theodore]]
Have a heart!

[msg MSG_011 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hang on. I'm sure there's a good reason[n]he's acting like this. Right, Theo?

[msg MSG_012 [Theodore]]
Yes... If we gather the materials[n]listed, we'll be able to craft new[n]equipment.
Each material is quite sturdy. They will[n]allow us to craft bigger, better, and[n]bulkier equipment.

[sel SEL_013 top]
They're that strong?
That's exciting.
Bulky, huh?

[msg MSG_014 [Theodore]]
Yes. On my honor, I'll make you[n]something worthwhile.

[msg MSG_015 [Junpei]]
Tough equipment'd be a dream!

[msg MSG_016 [Theodore]]
Yes. On my honor, I'll make you[n]something worthwhile.

[msg MSG_017 [Yukari]]
I don't know how I feel about bulky...

[msg MSG_018 [Theodore]]
I'm merely referring to the strength of[n]the equipment.
Rest assured, I guarantee you will all[n]be happy with both its effectiveness and[n]its design.

[msg MSG_019 [Elizabeth]]
Goodness, how dare you think you can use[n]the special screening for your own[n]gain...
I've half a mind to tell you to impale[n]yourself where you stand...
It seems that my worthless brother is[n]determined to have his head cut off.

[msg MSG_020 [Theodore]]
M-My head!?
...Right. If you're willing to risk your[n]lives for the sake of these materials...
Then I will do the same. Please lend me[n]your assistance.
