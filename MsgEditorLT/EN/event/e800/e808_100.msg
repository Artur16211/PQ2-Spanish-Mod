All right! We beat him!

[msg MSG_001 [Makoto]]
He was awfully quick to reveal himself.[n]I thought he'd try to play dumb.

[msg MSG_002 [Naoto]]
Normally, that's what they would do.[n]However, this is a special screening.
It's essentially a movie, so I imagined[n]the Shadow would follow some sort of[n]rule for how the ending plays out.

Brilliant.
That was amazing, Detective.

[msg MSG_004 [Naoto]]
Please, this wasn't just me. We solved[n]this together.

[msg MSG_005 [Chie]]
Yeah, Oracle was amazing too! She[n]remembered all of those testimonies!

[msg MSG_006 [Futaba]]
Heheh. I do have a pretty good memory.
A great detective needs a great[n]assistant! Just call me Watson.

[msg MSG_007 [Naoto]]
Oh? Oracle, do you read detective[n]novels?

[msg MSG_008 [Futaba]]
I've read the classics all the way up to[n]some of the newer and more popular ones[n]at least once.
Amazing how many stories you can tell[n]about old houses and deserted islands!

[msg MSG_009 [Naoto]]
*chuckle* I'd like to investigate a[n]crime scene at a place like that one[n]day.
Though it's rare one encounters a crime[n]scene like the ones found in novels.
How often do you hear of a detective[n]just happening upon a crime scene? It[n]doesn't really work that way.
You also don't see people wander off on[n]their own knowing full-well there's a[n]murderer on the loose.
Unlike in the world of fiction, a[n]detective's job is pretty[n]straightforward.

[msg MSG_010 [Futaba]]
Totally! Those people that run off on[n]their own...!
You'd have to be a real fool to do[n]something like that!

[msg MSG_011 [Naoto]]
Haha. That's just what people expect[n]from detective novels, I suppose.
Without things like that, crimes[n]wouldn't happen, and detectives wouldn't[n]have anything to work with.

[msg MSG_012 [Futaba]]
Yeah. Those stories wouldn't be much fun[n]if it was just, "The police came in the[n]morning."

[msg MSG_013 [Naoto]]
Exactly. The detective would be out of[n]the job.
Speaking of what's expected, I noticed[n]something interesting...

[msg MSG_014 [Morgana]]
Heeey, I don't mean to spoil the fun,[n]but...

[msg MSG_015 [Kanji]]
The hell are you guys talkin' about...?

[msg MSG_016 [Naoto]]
M-My apologies. I suppose I got caught[n]up in the conversation.

[msg MSG_017 [Futaba]]
Hey, that was a fun chat. Let's talk[n]more sometime soon!

[msg MSG_018 [Naoto]]
Certainly, if you'd like.
Now then, let's head back. We should[n]share our results with Elizabeth.

[msg MSG_019 [Akechi]]
...Hmm. That was quite a show, Detective[n]Prince. Very entertaining.
