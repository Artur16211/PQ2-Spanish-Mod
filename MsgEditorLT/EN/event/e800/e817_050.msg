[msg MSG_000 [Morgana]]
This is the last one.

[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
All right, let's see what we can find[n]out!

[msg MSG_002 [Junpei]]
*sigh* I didn't learn anything...

[msg MSG_002_1 [Junpei]]
Lemme just take a quick break...

[sel SEL_003 top]
Quit slacking off!
Junpei!

[msg MSG_004 [Junpei]]
Wha―!? Y-You've got it all wrong! I[n]wasn't slacking or nothin'...

[msg MSG_004_1 [Junpei]]
Oh, it's just you, Joker. Don't scare me[n]like that, man, I thought you were[n]Mitsuru-senpai.

[msg MSG_005 [Mitsuru]]
Oh...? Is there a problem with me being[n]here?

[msg MSG_006 [Junpei]]
Ack!?

[msg MSG_006_1 [Junpei]]
N-Not at all! Y'know, I think I missed a[n]few people, so I'm gonna do a little[n]more askin' around...

[msg MSG_007 [Mitsuru]]
Hmph...

[msg MSG_008 [Makoto]]
Well, he's on his feet again, so I guess[n]it worked out.

[msg MSG_009 [Mitsuru]]
I'm sorry you had to see yet another[n]shameful display of leadership.

[msg MSG_009_1 [Mitsuru]]
It was a lack of communication on my[n]part. Seeing you only makes that more[n]clear.

[msg MSG_010 [Makoto]]
Me?

[msg MSG_011 [Mitsuru]]
You're a student council president and[n]an elder among your peers...

[msg MSG_011_1 [Mitsuru]]
And, unlike me, you've built a proper[n]foundation of trust with the younger[n]members of your group.

[sel SEL_012 top]
Now she has...
She was pretty scary at first.
She really loosened up.

[msg MSG_013 [Mitsuru]]
...It wasn't always like this?

[msg MSG_014 [Makoto]]
Well, no. For a long time, I felt[n]separated from everyone else just like[n]you do now.

[msg MSG_014_1 [Makoto]]
But since meeting everyone, I think I've[n]changed somewhat...

[msg MSG_014_2 [Makoto]]
If anything, I'm envious of you,[n]Kirijo-san.

[msg MSG_015 [Mitsuru]]
Envious? Of me?

[msg MSG_016 [Makoto]]
In my case, I wouldn't say I was good at[n]making friends or anything. I think I[n]just didn't have a sense of seniority.

[msg MSG_016_1 [Makoto]]
Truthfully, I sort of respect that[n]commanding presence of yours...

[msg MSG_017 [Mitsuru]]
...So that's how you see it?
Hah, it seems we both have our[n]weaknesses.

[msg MSG_018 [Yukari]]
Oh, Mitsuru-senpai!

[msg MSG_019 [Mitsuru]]
How are things? Any useful information?

[msg MSG_020 [Yukari]]
Same story―someone was jumped by[n]multiple attackers and had their[n]valuables stolen.

[msg MSG_021 [Junpei]]
These guys are pretty pathetic to only[n]target young ladies.

[msg MSG_022 [Mitsuru]]
All of the victims are women?

[msg MSG_023 [Junpei]]
It was a girl about the same age as us,[n]just like the last place.

[msg MSG_024 [Makoto]]
Just like last place, you say... What[n]about the first victim?

[msg MSG_025 [Ryuji]]
Oh, you know, I think I did hear[n]somethin' about it being a young girl...

[msg MSG_026 [Yusuke]]
Yes, it likely raises their chances of[n]success when compared with targeting[n]muscular men.

[msg MSG_026_1 [Yusuke]]
Regardless, these thieves are the scum[n]of the earth.

[msg MSG_027 [Makoto]]
Agreed. But knowing their usual target[n]may be useful to us...

[sel SEL_028 top]
Useful?
We can bait them.

[msg MSG_029 [Makoto]]
If we know they only target girls, then[n]we can set a trap for them.

[msg MSG_030 [Morgana]]
I see. We're going to lure them in.

[msg MSG_031 [Makoto]]
Right. If we know they only target[n]girls, then we can set a trap for them.

[msg MSG_032 [Ken]]
But won't it be dangerous for whoever[n]plays the bait?

[msg MSG_033 [Makoto]]
I think I'd be able to defend myself,[n]but with my appearance...

[msg MSG_034 [Yukari]]
Ahaha... Yeah, I doubt they'd wanna[n]target a phantom thief...

[msg MSG_034_1 [Yukari]]
Should I go?

[msg MSG_035 [Mitsuru]]
No, I'll do it. As an elder of the[n]group, it's my job to take the risk.

[sel SEL_036 top]
Please do.
Don't let your guard down.
Want me to cross-dress?

[msg MSG_037 [Makoto]]
Yeah, we'll be ready to jump in at[n]anytime, so you won't have to worry.

[msg MSG_038 [Mitsuru]]
I know. That was my intention from the[n]start.

[msg MSG_039 [Ryuji]]
Don't think that's gonna work, dude...

[msg MSG_040 [Mitsuru]]
I appreciate your concern, but I'll be[n]fine.

[msg MSG_041 [Mitsuru]]
Yamagishi!

[msg MSG_042 [Fuuka]]
Y-Yes, ma'am!

[msg MSG_043 [Mitsuru]]
Can you find us a good location to lure[n]in the thieves?

[msg MSG_044 [Fuuka]]
Let me see... How about the back alley[n]near the center of the map?

[msg MSG_044_1 [Fuuka]]
Mitsuru-senpai will wait there on[n]standby. The rest of you will cover the[n]exits and attack them from both sides.

[msg MSG_045 [Mitsuru]]
Thank you. I'll mark the location on the[n]map.

[msg MSG_046 [Makoto]]
We can't let them get away with any more[n]thefts. Let's make our way to the alley.
