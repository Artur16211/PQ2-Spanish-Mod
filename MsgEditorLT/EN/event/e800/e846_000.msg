...It's kinda weird. Walking through[n]here and seeing all these signs is[n]getting me kinda nostalgic.
Wonder if those dinosaurs from Junessic[n]Land are doing okay?

[msg MSG_001 [Fuuka]]
Ahah... Are you worried about them?

[msg MSG_002 [Ann]]
Just a little. They're probably okay,[n]but you can't replace friends, y'know?

[msg MSG_002_1 [Ann]]
I was just thinking that if they did[n]learn to open up to each other, then[n]they should really treasure that.

[msg MSG_003 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Even if you don't always agree with[n]them, there's a lot of stuff you'd never[n]be able to do without friends.

[msg MSG_003_1 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Where's this coming from, Panther? You[n]thinking about one of your friends, too?

[msg MSG_004 [Ann]]
Yeah. Back in school, when I had[n]problems fitting in, I had someone who[n]stuck by me no matter what.
She was so kind... Always cared about[n]the people around her. More than she[n]cared about herself.

[msg MSG_005 [Fuuka]]
She sounds like a great friend.

[msg MSG_006 [Ann]]
Yeah. I love her, you know? She's always[n]gonna be a part of my life.
But... Some bad stuff happened, and she[n]had to go live somewhere far away...

[msg MSG_007 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Oh... Are you feeling lonely?

[msg MSG_008 [Ann]]
Yeah... I'd be lying if I said I wasn't.
But she's my best friend. Shiho's helped[n]me so much. So I'm fighting hard for her[n]sake, too.
I don't want my choices to bring her any[n]more pain. And... I know I'll see her[n]again someday.

[sel SEL_009 top]
Without a doubt.
We'll help you.

[msg MSG_010 [Ann]]
Yeah. So it's fine! No problem!

[msg MSG_011 [Ann]]
Yeah... Thanks.

[msg MSG_012 [Ann]]
Whoops, sorry. You guys don't HAVE to[n]listen to me ramble, okay?
I just thought of Shiho, and then all[n]this sappy stuff started coming out...
Don't worry about me, okay? I'm fine.[n]Gotta focus on the fight ahead of us.

[msg MSG_012_1 [Ann]]
Okay, break time's over! Let's pull[n]ourselves together and move out!

[msg MSG_013 [Fuuka]]
Panther...

[msg MSG_014 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I saw her smiling, but I dunno if she[n]was really feeling it...

[msg MSG_015 [Fuuka]]
...Yeah. It sounds like part of what[n]she's holding onto was bringing her[n]down...
I wish we had some way to get her mind[n]off it, and help her feel better.

[msg MSG_016 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Yeah. Hmm... Any big ideas, Joker?

[sel SEL_017 top]
Get her a present?
Surprise her.
Give her some space.

[msg MSG_018 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Oh, that might be a good idea! Something[n]that'll put a smile on her face!

[msg MSG_019 [Fuuka]]
Hmm. I just hope we can find something[n]like that in this world...

[msg MSG_020 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Oh, I see! So like, come up with[n]something we can do for her that'll make[n]her smile?

[msg MSG_021 [Fuuka]]
Hmm. I just hope we can prepare[n]something like that in this world...

[msg MSG_022 [Fuuka]]
I'm sure it'd be easier not to get[n]involved, but would it be best...?

[msg MSG_023 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hmm... Well, if we think of something we[n]can do, I think we should go for it.

[msg MSG_024 [Fuuka]]
Yeah. Hopefully we can come up with[n]something good...

[msg MSG_025 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Once we have some solid ideas on how to[n]cheer Panther up, let's put our heads[n]together!

[msg MSG_026]
A new special screening: "A Present for[n]You" has been added to the box office.
