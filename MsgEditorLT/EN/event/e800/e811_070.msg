Nice work, everybody! Mission complete!

[msg MSG_001 [Yukiko]]
Thanks, Futaba-chan. Good job[n]navigating.

[msg MSG_002 [Chie]]
That was fun! I felt just like a real[n]phantom thief!

[sel SEL_003 top]
You did well.
You need more training.

[msg MSG_004 [Chie]]
Yes! I got the phantom thief leader's[n]seal of approval!

[msg MSG_005 [Chie]]
Haha, I'm just getting started! I'll get[n]it down eventually!

[msg MSG_006 [Morgana]]
You guys aren't half bad! We'll need to[n]step it up ourselves.

[msg MSG_007 [Elizabeth]]
Well done, everyone.
I was so entranced by that riveting[n]treasure hunt, I nearly forgot to[n]breathe.
That was a most skillful display. It was[n]like watching an actual phantom thief[n]movie.

[msg MSG_008 [P4 Hero]]
By the way, how much are these treasures[n]worth?

[msg MSG_009 [Chie]]
Probably a lot, right? They were being[n]guarded by dinosaurs.
You think they're worth a lifetime[n]supply of beef bowls, or is that too[n]much?

[msg MSG_010 [Yosuke]]
Beef bowls? Is that really all you think[n]about?

[msg MSG_011 [Haru]]
Hmm... There's something about this[n]crown...
It doesn't feel heavy enough to be real[n]gold, and these jewels don't look[n]genuine at all...

[msg MSG_012 [Ann]]
What? Did we mess up somewhere?

[msg MSG_013 [Chie]]
After all that hard work...

[msg MSG_014 [Elizabeth]]
No no, there's no need to worry.
The point of this special screening was[n]to witness the esteemed Phantom Thieves[n]in action.
I would wager that the authenticity of[n]the treasure is irrelevant in light of[n]everyone's outstanding performance!

[msg MSG_015 [Yosuke]]
You're really trying to cushion the[n]blow, huh...?

[msg MSG_016 [Naoto]]
*chuckle* It's not too great a loss.
This was quite a valuable experience. I[n]genuinely did feel like a phantom thief.

[msg MSG_017 [Ryuji]]
We had fun too. It'd been awhile since[n]we did some phantom thief work.

[msg MSG_018 [Elizabeth]]
Ahh, it would appear the touching[n]conclusion is nearly upon us.
The treasure may be fake, but the bonds[n]you've forged are most definitely real!

[msg MSG_019 [Futaba]]
There it is! The oh-so-clichã€’, feel-[n]good ending!

[msg MSG_020 [Elizabeth]]
I eagerly await your next showing.
