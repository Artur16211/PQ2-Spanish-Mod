...Huh?

[msg MSG_001 [Yukari]]
Wait, are you saying...

[msg MSG_002 [Yusuke]]
Yes, that was me. I was nearly starving[n]to death at the time.

[msg MSG_003 [Chie]]
You told this story for a gag!?

[msg MSG_004 [Junpei]]
Wait, Yukki! You did the reveal too[n]early!

[msg MSG_005 [Yukiko]]
Huh? I did? I was just doing what you[n]told me...

[msg MSG_006 [Junpei]]
The idea is to draw it out as long as[n]possible and put everyone on the edge of[n]their seats...

[msg MSG_007 [Yukari]]
You roped Yukiko-chan into this too...?[n]You've got some nerve, Stupei.
This has been a long time coming. Any[n]last words?

[msg MSG_008 [Junpei]]
Wait, time out! Let's not do anything[n]crazy, Yuka-tan!
I only did it to help Yukiko-chan master[n]the "Believe It, or Don't" thing...

[msg MSG_009 [Makoto]]
...Any more nonsense, and you'll have to[n]answer to the iron fist of justice.

[msg MSG_010 [Junpei]]
Eek...! I'm sorry! I got carried away![n]Please, anything but the spikes!

[msg MSG_011 [Futaba]]
Hehehe. Queen's fists are scarier than[n]any ghost story. You better watch out.
Welp, our investigation is over. I think[n]it's time we head back.
