*sniff* *sniff*
Yes... That's it! The smell of juicy[n]meat!

[msg MSG_001 [Yusuke]]
Hmm, yes. I, too, am picking up the[n]faint aroma of meat from the south...

[msg MSG_002 [Ryuji]]
Huh? I can't smell a damn thing.

[msg MSG_003 [Yosuke]]
Don't worry, you're fine. They've just[n]got a freakish sense of smell.

[msg MSG_004 [Teddie]]
Hrm, hrm... I can smell it too! The[n]sweet, sweet smell of cooked beef!

[msg MSG_005 [Ann]]
Huh? I thought that FOE was holding[n]chicken, not beef.

[msg MSG_006 [Futaba]]
Well, chicken or beef, I'm definitely[n]picking up an FOE to the south.

[msg MSG_007 [Yosuke]]
Oh, are we close? All right, let's go!

[msg MSG_008 [Rise]]
Hold on, guys! I'm sensing a bunch of[n]treasure boxes up north!

[msg MSG_009 [Morgana]]
T-Treasure!?

I guess that also applies to the[n]treasure boxes this time around.

[msg MSG_011 [Yusuke]]
Hmm. So we either take the short path[n]and go straight for the meat, or we take[n]the long way and grab the treasure...

[msg MSG_012 [Chie]]
Ngh... I really want that meat, but the[n]treasure...

[msg MSG_013 [Morgana]]
The target FOE is to the south, but a[n]mountain of treasure's waiting for us if[n]we take the roundabout path north...
As always, we'll leave it to you, Joker!
