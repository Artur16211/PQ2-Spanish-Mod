These special screenings have been one[n]masterpiece after another...

[msg MSG_000_1 [Elizabeth]]
As I sit and observe your exploits, I[n]have been consuming popcorn at near-mach[n]speeds.

[msg MSG_001 [Haru]]
*giggle* Well, I suppose we have[n]completed a fair number of them.

[msg MSG_002 [Elizabeth]]
And now, the time has come once more for[n]a very special screening!

[msg MSG_003 [Yusuke]]
Ah, then... another task that calls for[n]a specific cast.

[msg MSG_004 [Elizabeth]]
Yes. Exactly correct.
It would seem a vicious new enemy has[n]emerged in the depths of Junessic[n]Land...
Your task will be to slay this Shadow.

[sel SEL_005 top]
Again?
About time.

[msg MSG_006 [Elizabeth]]
My, I never imagined you would react so[n]grumpily. I hope this sour expression[n]begets sweet results.

[msg MSG_007 [Futaba]]
Man, this lady won't take no for an[n]answer.

[msg MSG_008 [Elizabeth]]
I do appreciate your patience. Indeed,[n]I've been looking forward to this[n]myself.

[msg MSG_009 [Makoto]]
So, does [f 6 1 29 0 0 0]-kun have to fight this[n]one too?

[msg MSG_010 [Elizabeth]]
Absolutely, undeniably, exactly wrong.

[msg MSG_010_1 [Elizabeth]]
Lo and behold, the ticket for this[n]showing reads: "Cast: [f 6 1 13 0 0 0]."

[msg MSG_011 [P4 Hero]]
Me...?

[msg MSG_012 [Elizabeth]]
I ask that you ensure participates in[n]this battle.

[msg MSG_013 [P4 Hero]]
All right. I'll do what I can.

[msg MSG_014 [Makoto]]
And once we win against this Shadow?[n]Will we be fighting Theodore again?

[msg MSG_015 [Elizabeth]]
Well, I couldn't ruin the surprise[n]waiting behind the proverbial door[n]number two. Please use your imagination.
First, please focus on bringing your[n]strength to bear against this deadly[n]foe.
Good luck to you all.
