Here we are.

[msg MSG_000_1 [Mitsuru]]
All right, Joker's team will man the[n]west end, and everyone else will cover[n]the north, just like we planned.

[msg MSG_000_2 [Mitsuru]]
As soon as the thieves show up, we[n]surround them and take them out at once.

[sel SEL_001 top]
Got it.
They won't get away.

[msg MSG_002 [Mitsuru]]
Then, let's begin. Everyone, to your[n]positions!

[msg MSG_003 [Yukari]]
I wonder if Mitsuru-senpai'll be okay...

[msg MSG_004 [Junpei]]
It's not like you to be worried about[n]your senpai, Yuka-tan.

[msg MSG_005 [Yukari]]
Well, even she'd be in trouble going up[n]against a large group on her own...

[msg MSG_006 [Akihiko]]
That's exactly why she volunteered for[n]such a dangerous role.

[msg MSG_007 [Shinjiro]]
Tch, reckless of her...

[msg MSG_008 [Akihiko]]
It just shows how much she trusts us.

[msg MSG_008_1 [Akihiko]]
She's willing to place her life in our[n]hands.

[msg MSG_009 [Junpei]]
......

[msg MSG_010 [Akihiko]]
They're here! Now, everyone!

[msg MSG_011 [Junpei]]
Chaaarge!

[msg MSG_012 [Yukari]]
Whaâ€•!? Junpei, wait for us!

[msg MSG_013 [Makoto]]
They're here! Everyone ready!?

[sel SEL_014 top]
Let's go!
Bring 'em down!

[msg MSG_015 [Junpei]]
Hyaaah! Keep your hands off my senpai!

[msg MSG_015_1 [Junpei]]
...Wait, these are the thieves!?

[msg MSG_016 [Makoto]]
They're Shadows!?

[msg MSG_017 [Mitsuru]]
Yes, it would appear so. Still, that[n]doesn't change anything.

[msg MSG_018 [Futaba]]
Here they come! Get ready...
