[msg MSG_000 [Chie]]
This is the spot.

[msg MSG_001 [Yusuke]]
Good. Let the search begin.

[msg MSG_002 [Makoto]]
It doesn't look like there's anything[n]here...

[msg MSG_003 [Ryuji]]
Man, let's take a break. My hip's[n]startin' to hurt.

[msg MSG_004 [Futaba]]
You sound like an old man, Skull.

[msg MSG_005 [Ryuji]]
Shut up! It just means I've been workin'[n]hard!

[msg MSG_006 [Morgana]]
Well, we can't just keep blindly poking[n]around.
My paws are getting cold.

[sel SEL_007 top]
Let's take a break.
We need to try harder.
Think I'll go for a swim.

[msg MSG_008 [Morgana]]
What's gotten into you!?

[msg MSG_009 [Naoto]]
I don't believe trying harder is going[n]to help...

[msg MSG_010 [Ann]]
Then let's all just take a break!

[msg MSG_011 [Rise]]
That's your idea of relaxing!?

[msg MSG_012 [P4 Hero]]
Calm down.

[msg MSG_013 [Akechi]]
I think it'd be best if we just take a[n]break.

[msg MSG_014 [Yusuke]]
A break...?
I'm going to continue looking around.[n]Feel free to take a break if you wish.

[msg MSG_015 [Chie]]
Whoa now, there's no need to push[n]yourself.

[msg MSG_016 [Yusuke]]
This doesn't even come close to pushing[n]myself.
I was once forced to survive on nothing[n]but grass and bean sprouts for three[n]whole days.

[msg MSG_017 [Ryuji]]
What, were you stranded on an island or[n]somethin'!?

[msg MSG_018 [Yukiko]]
Is it all right if I continue looking[n]too?

[msg MSG_019 [Teddie]]
Wh-Wha!? You really are excited about[n]this, Yuki-chan!

[msg MSG_020 [Futaba]]
Well, it doesn't look like there's many[n]Shadows around. Just be careful.

[msg MSG_021 [Yukiko]]
I don't see anything over here. What[n]about you, Fox?

[msg MSG_022 [Yusuke]]
I'm afraid it's the same for me.

[msg MSG_023 [Makoto]]
You two should take a break. You're[n]going to tire yourselves out.

[msg MSG_024 [Naoto]]
There doesn't appear to be any ammonites[n]in the area. We'll have to search[n]somewhere else.

[msg MSG_025 [Ryuji]]
Yeah. But let's let these two rest[n]first.

[msg MSG_026 [Yusuke]]
My apologies for dragging all of you[n]into this...

[sel SEL_027 top]
Don't worry about it.
We're used to it.
We'll need something in return.

[msg MSG_028 [Ann]]
Yeah, I wanna see more of Yukiko-chan's[n]amazing art too!

[msg MSG_029 [Futaba]]
Agreed. In fact, it's weird to hear you[n]apologize for it.

[msg MSG_030 [Makoto]]
Mhm. We'll need you to work just as hard[n]for us. Sound fair?

[msg MSG_031 [Yusuke]]
Hmhm, It seems I've made some good[n]friends...

[msg MSG_032 [Ryuji]]
Hm? You say somethin'?

[msg MSG_033 [Yusuke]]
Nothing... Where do we go from here?

[msg MSG_034 [Futaba]]
Closest body of water's to the[n]northwest.

[msg MSG_035 [Yusuke]]
All right, let's move!
...On second thought, I think I may be[n]too hungry to move.

[msg MSG_036 [Haru]]
I brought some cookies, so why don't you[n]finally take a break? You too,[n]Yukiko-chan.

[msg MSG_037 [Yukiko]]
Oh, okay. Thank you.

[msg MSG_038 [Morgana]]
It's settled, then. We take a break then[n]head northwest!
