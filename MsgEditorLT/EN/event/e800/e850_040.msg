Even Shadows of tremendous power are[n]nothing but child's play for you.
You've all grown admirably since your[n]arrival here. Your newfound power is[n]truly remarkable.

[msg MSG_001 [Hikari]]
You're all really amazing...
I've been watching you, so I can tell.[n]You've all been getting stronger and[n]stronger.

[msg MSG_002 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Yeah, I kinda surprised myself!

[msg MSG_002_1 [P3 Fem Protag]]
But still... I'm fighting for everyone,[n]not just myself. I think that's the only[n]reason I made it this far.

[msg MSG_003 [Elizabeth]]
You each work to hone your ability, and[n]fateful meetings give birth to further[n]power.
I feel I've learned something vitally[n]important from watching your exploits on[n]the silver screen...

[msg MSG_003_1 [Elizabeth]]
Though it may not be my place, I'd like[n]to thank you all once more.

[sel SEL_004 top]
It's your turn next.
We're not done yet.

[msg MSG_005 [Elizabeth]]
Yes, I understand.

[msg MSG_005_1 [Elizabeth]]
Limitless possibilities are hidden[n]within that obscured film...
I feel the hour drawing near. Soon, we[n]will see all its secrets laid bare.
But for now... there is nothing more I[n]can say.

[msg MSG_005_2 [Elizabeth]]
In any case, please come speak to me[n]once you are prepared.
