A house on a dead end... Well, this[n]looks promising.

[msg MSG_001 [Hikari]]
Yeah, this has to be it. I sense[n]something inside the house.
...It's here! The precious item I[n]forgot!

[msg MSG_002 [Futaba]]
Careful, you've attracted the attention[n]of some Shadows! They're not about to[n]just let you walk on past!

[msg MSG_003 [Yosuke]]
Hey, no skin off our nose. Let's give[n]'em what they came for!

[msg MSG_004 [Junpei]]
Just watch, Hikari-chan. The Phantom[n]Thieves' famed cleanup hitter Junpei[n]Iori is up to bat!

[msg MSG_005 [Ryuji]]
Look alive, guys! Whatever Hikari's[n]lost, we're getting it home to her, safe[n]and sound!
