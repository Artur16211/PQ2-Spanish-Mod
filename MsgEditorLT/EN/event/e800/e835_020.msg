Well, we're here! Man, this place[n]screams sci-fi everywhere you look.
So we gotta find an egg, right?

[msg MSG_001 [Ann]]
Hey, look over there!

[msg MSG_002 [Futaba]]
The picture on the monitor changed? It's[n]an arrow now.

[msg MSG_003 [Ann]]
Oh, yeah, I remember this from when I[n]was little.
During Easter egg hunts, there would be[n]signs like those to help you find the[n]hiding spots.

[msg MSG_004 [Junpei]]
Ooh, leave it to Panther to school us on[n]some overseas bidness!
You're sayin' we just gotta follow the[n]arrows, yeah?

[msg MSG_005 [Futaba]]
Hmm, so there's an Easter egg hidden at[n]the end of the path?
Aaaaall right, Joker. Keep your eyes on[n]the monitors and follow those arrows!
