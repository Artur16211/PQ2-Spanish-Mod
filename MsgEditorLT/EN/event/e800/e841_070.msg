Here is your reward.

[msg MSG_001 [Margaret]]
I would like to personally thank you as[n]well. It was kind of you to fulfill[n]Marie's request.
Marie? Don't you also have something to[n]give to them?

[msg MSG_002 [Marie]]
Um, well... There's this...

[sel SEL_003 top]
What is it?
You're giving us something?

[msg MSG_004 [Marie]]
N-N-N-Nothing! It's nothing!
It's definitely not like I'm thanking[n]you or anything, for letting me come[n]with you into the movie.

[msg MSG_005 [Marie]]
Huh!? Uh, well... you know...
I-I mean, it's not like I'm feeling[n]happy that you let me tag along inside[n]the movie or anything like that.

[msg MSG_006 [Marie]]
The point is... thanks. I want you to[n]have this.

By the way, Marie, did you finish your[n]poem?

[msg MSG_009 [Marie]]
Yeah, I think it's almost done...
I mean, no! It's not a poem! It's more[n]like... an expression of pathos...

[msg MSG_010 [Akechi]]
Isn't that basically a poem?

[msg MSG_011 [Marie]]
No, it's not like that![n]You'restupidIhateyouyou'retheworst!

[msg MSG_012 [P4 Hero]]
Nevertheless, we'd love to see the[n]finished product at some point.

[sel SEL_013 top]
Yeah, looking forward to it.
Even though it tortures her?

[msg MSG_014 [P4 Hero]]
Of course!

[msg MSG_015 [P4 Hero]]
...You've got a point.
