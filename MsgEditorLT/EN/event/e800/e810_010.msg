It seems that a new special screening[n]has been added.
The task this time is to catch an[n]ancient fish in Junessic Land.
We'll be fishing in ancient times.

[msg MSG_001 [Chie]]
Fishing? I don't have a lotta experience[n]with fishing...

[msg MSG_002 [Kanji]]
Well, it's not like you care much about[n]fish, right, Chie-senpai?

[msg MSG_003 [Chie]]
Aw, c'mon, you make it sound like all I[n]ever want is meat.
Now that I think about it, fishing's not[n]exactly something I'd expect from a[n]phantom thief.

[msg MSG_004 [Ryuji]]
I mean, we do go to fishing ponds every[n]now 'n' then, don't we,?
You're good at this stuff, aren't ya?

[sel SEL_005 top]
Kinda.
Leave it to me.
Not as good as Ms. Kawakami.

[msg MSG_006 [Teddie]]
Ngh... These city boys can do[n]anything...
But Sensei can do so much more!

[msg MSG_007 [Teddie]]
So much confidence...
But Sensei can do so much more!

[msg MSG_008 [Ryuji]]
Yeah, she gets a bite the moment it hits[n]the water. She's a friggin' pro...
So you're not that good, but you're[n]still pretty confident, yeah?

[msg MSG_009 [Teddie]]
Hoho... But our Sensei can do so much[n]more!

[msg MSG_010 [P4 Hero]]
I've got some fishing experience myself.[n]I'm sure I can help.

[msg MSG_011 [Haru]]
Really? What kind of fish have you[n]caught, [f 6 1 12 0 0 0]-kun?

[msg MSG_012 [P4 Hero]]
Let's see... Everything from a bus stop[n]sign to the legendary Sea Guardian.

[msg MSG_013 [Haru]]
A bus stop sign...?

[msg MSG_014 [Elizabeth]]
We have two fishing rods here...
Therefore, we'll entrust this to the two[n]who wield the power of the wild card,[n]given their loads of fishing experience.
Fish, fish, fish all the fish you wish.
