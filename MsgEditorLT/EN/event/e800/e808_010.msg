[msg MSG_000 [Elizabeth]]
Next time, on Dragon Ba―I mean―the[n]special screening...

[msg MSG_001 [Futaba]]
Oh hoh. This next one sounds like some[n]"over 9000" business...

[msg MSG_002 [Yusuke]]
Over 9000? What are you talking about?

[msg MSG_003 [Futaba]]
Wha―!? You don't know!? The whole world[n]knows what that is!

[msg MSG_004 [Naoto]]
I-Is that so? I'm afraid I don't[n]understand either...

[msg MSG_005 [Elizabeth]]
Quiet, please! Special screenings are[n]not to be taken lightly...
If you don't keep quiet, you'll face my[n]power of 530,000!

[msg MSG_006 [Ryuji]]
Oh geez, she's goin' all out with[n]this...

[msg MSG_007 [Naoto]]
What would you have us do, Elizabeth?[n]Please elaborate.

[msg MSG_008 [Elizabeth]]
I'm glad you asked.
This special screening asks that you[n]find a police impersonator!
A Shadow is creating confusion amongst[n]the citizens of Kamo City.

[sel SEL_009 top]
That's unforgivable.
You want us to take care of it?

[msg MSG_010 [Kanji]]
Hell yeah! We'll just find the Shadow[n]and put the hurt on 'im!

[msg MSG_011 [Elizabeth]]
It may not prove as easy as it sounds.
The Shadow has disguised itself as one[n]of the police officers patrolling the[n]city.
In order to find it, you will need to[n]find and speak with each of them.

[msg MSG_012 [Chie]]
Wow! So it'll be like an investigation?[n]We'll be like actual detectives!

[msg MSG_013 [Naoto]]
The question is: Will the fake police[n]officer admit that he's a fake?

[msg MSG_014 [Elizabeth]]
The Shadow will most likely try to lie[n]its way out of being caught.
Therefore, you'll need to speak to all[n]of the police officers.

[msg MSG_015 [Ann]]
But how do we know which one is lying?

[msg MSG_016 [Naoto]]
Ah... It's like a logic puzzle.

[msg MSG_017 [Chie]]
Logic puzzle?

[msg MSG_018 [Naoto]]
It's a type of puzzle where you have to[n]identify a contradiction among the[n]information you are given.
In this case, we must speak to the[n]police officers and find the[n]contradiction within their testimonies.

[msg MSG_019 [Futaba]]
So we have to find the lie! Sounds like[n]fun!

[sel SEL_020 top]
Got it.
It's a little confusing...

[msg MSG_021 [Ann]]
Are you serious? I didn't get any of[n]that... You're pretty smart, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0].

[msg MSG_022 [Futaba]]
No sweat! I've got your backs!

[msg MSG_023 [Naoto]]
You needn't worry. It's not so bad once[n]you give it a try.
First and foremost, we'll need to find[n]the police officers.

[msg MSG_024 [Akechi]]
Let's see what you can do, Detective[n]Prince.
