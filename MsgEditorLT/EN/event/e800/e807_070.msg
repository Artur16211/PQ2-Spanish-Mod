Well done, everyone. I have confirmation[n]that the FOE was indeed defeated.
However... there is one thing I am[n]dissatisfied with.
I had been restlessly waiting for you to[n]bring back some chicken as a souvenir,[n]and yet you've brought nothing!

[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
You're not really cryin', are ya?

[msg MSG_002 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Sorry, Elizabeth. It wasn't real[n]chicken...
But I get that knowing you can't eat it[n]probably makes you want it even more.

[msg MSG_003 [Chie]]
Got that right...
*れもむめ* びめま よょゅを るまぺれよょ と ゐぺれ ろるをもょむ れよ めぺるぽ[n]ゐぺれ ほまぼぺゎれま と ろめよゎむめろ と'ぽ むまろ ろよ ぽもむ もょろよ れよゆま[n]みるもまぽ ぼめもぼやまょ よょぼま ゐま ゐまるま ぽよょまテ

[msg MSG_004 [Yusuke]]
Agreed. Fried chicken is the only thing[n]that could possibly fill the void that[n]is now my stomach...

[msg MSG_005 [Yosuke]]
Wow, those two look really depressed...
Okay, you know what? Once all this is[n]over, I'll treat you guys at Junes, so[n]just hold out till then.

[msg MSG_006 [Chie]]
Really!?

[msg MSG_007 [Yusuke]]
How much do you plan to treat us to?[n]Will this be an all-you-can-eat affair?

[msg MSG_008 [Yosuke]]
It's just fried chicken. Eat as much as[n]you want.

[msg MSG_009 [Chie]]
Yaaay! Mind adding some steaks to that!?

[msg MSG_010 [Yusuke]]
Chicken and beef don't create a good[n]balance. We'd best include some pork as[n]well.

[msg MSG_011 [Yosuke]]
Arrgh! Don't just start ordering[n]whatever you want!
Sheesh... How 'bout creating a good[n]balance for my wallet first!?

[msg MSG_012 [P3 Fem Protag]]
You're really good at looking out for[n]others, aren't you, Yosuke-kun? That's[n]so cool!

[msg MSG_013 [P4 Protag]]
Yeah, Yosuke always keeps an eye on the[n]people he cares about and helps put[n]everyone in a good mood.
Although, he often does too good of a[n]job, and his wallet suffers for it...

[msg MSG_014 [Yosuke]]
Haha... It's 'cause these guys don't[n]have any self-control...

[msg MSG_015 [P4 Hero]]
...Still, you should take it easy every[n]now and then, Yosuke.

[msg MSG_016 [Yosuke]]
Huh? Whaddya mean, partner?

[msg MSG_017 [P4 Hero]]
You don't always have to be the one to[n]depend on.
If anything's ever got you down, you can[n]lean on us too.

[msg MSG_018 [Yosuke]]
......
Heheh, is it that obvious? Nothin' gets[n]past you, eh, partner?

[msg MSG_019 [P4 Hero]]
You're still bothered by how you got[n]separated from us in Junessic Land,[n]aren't you?

[msg MSG_020 [Yosuke]]
I don't know if everyone was trying to[n]avoid touching on it for my sake or not,[n]but I guess I do feel kinda guilty...
I just couldn't shake the feeling that I[n]needed to make up for that somehow...[n]Sorry, everyone.

[msg MSG_021 [Chie]]
You were worried about that, Yosuke? You[n]always get so serious about the weirdest[n]things.

[msg MSG_022 [Kanji]]
Guess you're softer than you look,[n]Yosuke-senpai.

[msg MSG_023 [Yosuke]]
Aw, lay off! I'm sensitive, all right!?[n]I think about these things!

[msg MSG_024 [Yukiko]]
*giggle* But that's one of your strong[n]points, Yosuke-kun.

[msg MSG_025 [Teddie]]
Yeah, Yosuke, if you want someone to[n]lean on, you can always lean on me!
Here, Teddie's gotcha! Come lean!

[msg MSG_026 [Yosuke]]
Uh, no thanks. You're all sticky from[n]the ice cream.
*sigh* You know, somehow, after talking[n]with you guys, all my worries just kinda[n]fade away.

[sel SEL_027 top]
You've got good friends.
People really like you.

[msg MSG_028 [Yosuke]]
Heheh, I know, right?

[msg MSG_029 [Yosuke]]
That or they just like free food...[n]Sometimes it's hard to tell.
They are good friends, though, aren't[n]they?

[msg MSG_030 [Naoto]]
True, Yosuke-senpai always manages to[n]lighten the mood when he's around.

[msg MSG_031 [Ann]]
Yeah, I'm starting to see why everyone[n]likes you, Yosuke-kun.
I'm glad you made it back to your[n]friends.

[msg MSG_032 [P4 Hero]]
Yeah, we couldn't have done it without[n]your help.
Thanks for helping us save him.

[msg MSG_033 [Yosuke]]
Wait! If we're giving out thanks, then[n]let me give mine too!
Thanks for coming after me, guys. I'm[n]glad to be here with everyone!

[msg MSG_034 [Elizabeth]]
Oh my, we've somehow gone from talk of[n]fake chicken to a touching exchange on[n]the beauty of friendship...
Though the matter of the chicken is[n]still quite regrettable...
Nevertheless, I suppose this outcome is[n]satisfactory.
Here is your reward. Please accept it.
