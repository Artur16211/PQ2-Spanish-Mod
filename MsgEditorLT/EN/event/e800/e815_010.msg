Now, for this special screening...
You are to go to Junessic Land and end[n]the unchecked tyranny of the Ravenous[n]Beast.

[msg MSG_001 [Rise]]
Carnivorous... Wait, so it's not one of[n]those FOEs?

[msg MSG_002 [Elizabeth]]
Correct... It's a much more malicious[n]menace than any ordinary dinosaur.
Devouring everything in sight, it's the[n]definition of B-E-A-S-T.
It's currently running amok, doing[n]whatever it pleases, wherever it[n]pleases...
If something is not done soon, it is[n]sure to prey on you sooner or later...[n]or so I fear.

[msg MSG_003 [Shinjiro]]
The shit you're sayin' sure doesn't[n]match your expression...

[msg MSG_004 [Akihiko]]
Wow, that sounds like one terrifying[n]opponent.

[msg MSG_005 [Shinjiro]]
Same with you...
So, how do we find this thing? Can the[n]navigators spot it for us?

[msg MSG_006 [Rise]]
Hmm, it's moving around so much, I don't[n]think we can pinpoint its exact[n]location...
If only we had some kinda hint as to[n]where it might be...

[sel SEL_007 top]
Let's look for bones.
Near its prey.

[msg MSG_008 [Akechi]]
Good idea. All we have to do is look for[n]the tracks left behind by this Ravenous[n]Beast.
If it's attacking and eating everything[n]it lays eyes on, then we can follow its[n]feeding trail...

[msg MSG_009 [Shinjiro]]
And eventually we'll come face to face[n]with the bastard, huh? Pretty gruesome.

[msg MSG_010 [Akechi]]
So we'll need to find traces of its[n]latest meal... In other words, fresh[n]dinosaur bones.
Sound good, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]?

[sel SEL_011 top]
I'll leave it to you.
Whatever you want.

[msg MSG_012 [Akechi]]
Me...?
Haha, very well. I suppose I should pull[n]some weight every now and then.

[msg MSG_013 [Akechi]]
Haha, are you saying you want me to[n]handle this?
Very well, then. I was curious about[n]this Ravenous Beast anyhow.

[msg MSG_014 [Akihiko]]
Whatever it is, it's definitely tough. I[n]can't wait to meet it.

[msg MSG_015 [Akechi]]
Haha, I'm glad I can count on you. I'll[n]try to meet expectations as well.
