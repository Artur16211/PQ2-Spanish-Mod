Phew... I think that makes eight.

[msg MSG_001 [Makoto]]
Yeah, that should be all of them. Let's[n]hurry back and report in.

[msg MSG_002 [Ann]]
Whoa! They finished it just like[n]that...?

[msg MSG_003 [Teddie]]
*huff* *puff* They're so fast... I could[n]bear-ly keep up...
Are you two always like this?

[msg MSG_004 [Makoto]]
Well, not exactly... We've just had[n]something on our minds lately...

[msg MSG_005 [Morgana]]
Something on your minds? Is there[n]anything wrong?

[msg MSG_006 [Haru]]
Um, we probably shouldn't just stand[n]around here talking. Why don't we head[n]back first?
If you really want to know, we can tell[n]you later... Okay?

[msg MSG_007 [Ryuji]]
Yeah, that's cool. All right then, let's[n]get goin'.
