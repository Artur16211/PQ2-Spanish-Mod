No matter what I eat, I'm never[n]satiated. Is it a sin to feel this way?

Ooh, is that what you were looking for?

[msg MSG_004 [Marie]]
Sweet fruit... No. It needs to sound[n]more tempting... and more toxic...

[sel SEL_005 top]
Forbidden fruit.
Poisoned apple.
Rotten fruit.

[msg MSG_006 [Marie]]
Yes, that's it! You're pretty good at[n]poetry. Maybe you have secret yearnings[n]of your own...?
...The sweet forbidden fruit. Yes[n]indeed, I like the sound of that!

Poisoned apple... Forbidden apple... No,[n]forbidden fruit!

Oh, are you done?

[msg MSG_012 [Marie]]
*gasp* NYAAAAAAAH! Was I talking out[n]loud!?
This can't be! Please, stop up your[n]ears! Fling such words far away from[n]your memory!

[msg MSG_013 [P4 Hero]]
Okay, okay. Calm down. Why don't you[n]just tell me if your poem is finished?

[msg MSG_014 [Marie]]
Er, what's a poetic way of saying this?[n]Almost.
If I can just get a bit more[n]inspiration, I think I can finish...

[msg MSG_015 [Singing flower]]
If your soul is unfulfilled... then go[n]NORTH, young lass!

[msg MSG_016 [Akechi]]
Oh, that's right. I heard singing up[n]there. It was deep in an area with a[n]bear FOE...

[msg MSG_017 [Yosuke]]
Yeah, that was definitely up north.[n]Okay, then! Let's go!

[msg MSG_018 [P4 Hero]]
Let's just remember to keep our eyes[n]peeled for FOEs.
