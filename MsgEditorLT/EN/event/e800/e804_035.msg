[msg MSG_000 [Ann]]
Whew... Looks like we made it through.

[msg MSG_001 [Chie]]
Man, this really does tire you out...

[msg MSG_002 [Ann]]
You say that, but you handled it[n]perfectly.

[msg MSG_003 [Chie]]
R-Really? Hehe... It's probably just[n]because you're such a good teacher,[n]Panther...

[msg MSG_004 [Ann]]
I just gave you a little hint, is all.
You might even be cut out for the[n]Phantom Thieves, Chie-chan.

[sel SEL_005 top]
You're welcome to join.
What about the Investigation Team?
It'll be a double life.

[msg MSG_006 [Yukiko]]
Even if you did join the Phantom[n]Thieves, we'll always be there for you,[n]Chie.

[msg MSG_007 [Teddie]]
The Investigation Team AND the Phantom[n]Thieves, hm?
With someone as passionate as you,[n]Chie-chan, I bet you'd do great in both!

[msg MSG_008 [Chie]]
I'll be, like, investigator by day,[n]phantom thief by night! Something like[n]that?

[msg MSG_009 [Teddie]]
With someone as passionate as you,[n]Chie-chan, I bet you'd do great in both!

[msg MSG_010 [Teddie]]
The Investigation Team AND the Phantom[n]Thieves, hm?
With someone as passionate as you,[n]Chie-chan, I bet you'd do great in both!

[msg MSG_011 [Yukiko]]
Even if you did join the Phantom[n]Thieves, we'll always be there for you,[n]Chie.

[msg MSG_012 [Ann]]
Yeah, I'm sure you'd make a great[n]phantom thief, Chie-chan!

[msg MSG_013 [Chie]]
Awww geez, you guys are making me blush.
You won't get anything out of me except[n]for maybe some meat gum...

[msg MSG_014 [Yosuke]]
Uh, no thanks. We're good.

[msg MSG_015 [Chie]]
Still, I'm really happy to hear you say[n]that, Panther...

[msg MSG_016 [Ann]]
Huh?

[msg MSG_017 [Chie]]
You're, like, a supermodel from the[n]city.
Yeah, you're pretty, but you're also[n]stylish. You're on top of all the latest[n]fashion and stuff.

[msg MSG_018 [Teddie]]
Hrrm, I see... It's true that your[n]beauty is on par with our girls out in[n]the country...
And you are a beary trendy lady,[n]Panther.

[msg MSG_019 [Ann]]
You think so?

[msg MSG_020 [Yosuke]]
Well yeah, you can find all the latest[n]fashion trends in the city, can't you?

[msg MSG_021 [Yukiko]]
Do ya ever chill at da nightclubs in[n]Shibuya, or eat da sushi over in Ginza?

[sel SEL_022 top]
No nightclubs for us.
Sometimes we eat sushi.
Why are you talking like that?

[msg MSG_023 [Yukiko]]
Oh, then, we've got you beat there!

[msg MSG_024 [Ryuji]]
Whaâ€•? You guys've actually been to a[n]nightclub?

[msg MSG_025 [Kanji]]
Well, Senpai sorta dragged us along...

[msg MSG_026 [Yosuke]]
You serious...?

[msg MSG_027 [Yusuke]]
That isn't to say it's good because it's[n]expensive, but it certainly is[n]delicious...

[msg MSG_028 [Yukiko]]
I just figured that's how celebrities[n]from the city talk.

[msg MSG_029 [Futaba]]
But you guys have a national idol in[n]your group...

[msg MSG_030 [Chie]]
Man, the city sounds so cool. You guys[n]probably have so much to do up there.
Pretty much the only place we have to[n]hang out is Junes.

[msg MSG_031 [Ann]]
Junes?

[msg MSG_032 [Chie]]
Uh, it's like a supermarket?
But it also sells, like, electronics and[n]clothes and stuff. There's even a food[n]court on the roof.

[msg MSG_033 [Ann]]
Whoa, that's convenient! I'm so jealous.[n]I'd love to check that out sometime.

[msg MSG_034 [Chie]]
Huh? It's not that out of the ordinary,[n]is it...?

[msg MSG_035 [Yosuke]]
The city doesn't really have big[n]department stores like that.

[msg MSG_036 [Chie]]
All right then, I'll show you around[n]next time! And Yosuke can treat you at[n]the food court!

[msg MSG_037 [Yosuke]]
Why me!? Fine, whatever, you'll probably[n]just order steak again anyway...
Well, it's something to look forward to[n]when we get back. Right now we need to[n]find that manhole.
Let's go, guys.
