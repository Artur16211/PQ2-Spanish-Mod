Two down, two to go. That one wasn't so[n]bad.

[msg MSG_001 [Shinjiro]]
Yeah, well, it ain't over yet.

[msg MSG_002 [Akihiko]]
Sorry, Shinji, but this competition is[n]mine. No hard feelings, all right?

[msg MSG_003 [Shinjiro]]
Yeah, sure... Dumbass.

[msg MSG_004 [Mitsuru]]
Stop it, you two! Aren't you[n]embarrassed, acting like that in front[n]of the underclassmen!?

[msg MSG_005 [Akihiko]]
Don't worry, Mitsuru. Shinji'll calm[n]down once this is all over.

[msg MSG_006 [Shinjiro]]
Oh, like I'm gonna lose? You're gonna[n]eat those words, you little shit!

[msg MSG_007 [P3 Fem Protag]]
*giggle* Okay, let's go! Onto the third[n]one!

[msg MSG_008 [Mitsuru]]
