[msg MSG_000 [P3 Hero]]
Doesn't look like there are a lot around[n]here...

[msg MSG_001 [P4 Hero]]
Yeah, not here either.

[msg MSG_002 [Haru]]
Excuse me, but I was wondering...
Are you two really such big eaters? I[n]would never have guessed...

[msg MSG_003 [P4 Hero]]
Yeah, I don't know. I've never thought[n]of myself as one.

[msg MSG_004 [Yosuke]]
Whoa, whoa, man. Anyone who can finish[n]Aiya's Mega Beef Bowl is definitely some[n]kind of monster...
That thing's loaded with five times the[n]beef, right?

[msg MSG_005 [Yukiko]]
The only ones who can finish it are-kun,[n]or maybe Chie.

[msg MSG_006 [P4 Hero]]
Now that was a battle...

[msg MSG_007 [P3 Hero]]
Huh. Sounds pretty impressive.

[msg MSG_008 [Junpei]]
Hey, look who's talking! You eat like a[n]horse too, right?

[msg MSG_009 [Yukari]]
Extra noodles in your ramen, speed-[n]eating takoyaki... I think you've got a[n]reputation at Paulownia Mall.

[msg MSG_010 [Aigis]]
Your intake exceeds your body's[n]estimated capacity, yet your vitals and[n]expression indicate no difficulty.

[msg MSG_011 [Ryuji]]
Those two really are amazing... No[n]wonder the blue crew's all over them.

[sel SEL_012 top]
They're unbeatable.
I'm on their level.

[msg MSG_013 [Ryuji]]
Huh? But you actually beat the Big Bang[n]Challenge, didn't you?

[msg MSG_014 [Yosuke]]
Wait, you too!?

[msg MSG_015 [Ryuji]]
Now that I think about it, you did beat[n]the Big Bang Challenge...

[msg MSG_016 [Haru]]
I'd say it takes quite a bit of guts to[n]finish that...

[msg MSG_017 [Kanji]]
Huh. So your leader's the same way?
I guess if you wanna be the boss, you[n]gotta eat tons of food?

[msg MSG_018 [Yosuke]]
C'mon, no way... Eating's just about how[n]big your stomach is, right?

[sel SEL_019 top]
It's about guts.
It's about knowledge.
It's about proficiency.
It's about kindness.

[msg MSG_020 [P4 Hero]]
Right. To eat well, you need[n]understanding of your limits, knowledge[n]to control your pace...
The courage to face an unrelenting tide[n]of food, and the diligence to persevere[n]against a colossal challenge.

[msg MSG_021 [Aigis]]
Those are precisely the skills necessary[n]to be a leader.

[msg MSG_022 [Yosuke]]
Oh. Uh... okay. Sorry.

[msg MSG_023 [P4 Hero]]
Don't worry about it. Let's find the[n]parts we need.

[msg MSG_024 [P3 Hero]]
Yeah. Let's keep moving.

[msg MSG_025 [Mitsuru]]
So a ravenous appetite is the key to[n]true leadership...? Fascinating...

[msg MSG_026 [Junpei]]
Uh, I dunno if you wanna use these guys[n]as reference for that...
