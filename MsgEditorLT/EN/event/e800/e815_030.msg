Arf! Woof, woof!

[msg MSG_001 [Ken]]
Look, more bones! We're really making[n]progress, huh?

[msg MSG_002 [Akechi]]
Yes, thanks to Koromaru-kun. All right,[n]it looks like it's my turn.

[msg MSG_003 [Akechi]]
These certainly look like leftovers, and[n]they're pretty recent too.

[msg MSG_004 [Akihiko]]
What!? Is it finally time for the[n]face-off!?

[msg MSG_005 [Akechi]]
Haha, sorry, not quite yet.
I said recent, but it's still been some[n]time since these bones were left behind.

[msg MSG_006 [Koromaru]]
Bark, bark, bark!

[msg MSG_007 [Akechi]]
I see. So we should make our way east[n]now?

[msg MSG_008 [Ken]]
......!

[sel SEL_009 top]
You can understand him?
I think he said west.

[msg MSG_010 [Akechi]]
Oh, no, not really. I just sort of[n]pictured him saying that.
Was I right, Amada-kun?

[msg MSG_011 [Ken]]
...Yeah. It sounds like Koromaru's[n]saying to head east.

[msg MSG_012 [Akechi]]
Hm? Was I wrong?

[msg MSG_013 [Ken]]
...No, you were right, Crow. Koromaru[n]said to head east.

[msg MSG_014 [Rise]]
Wow, Crow and Koro-chan make a pretty[n]good team.
Okay then, we're heading east!
