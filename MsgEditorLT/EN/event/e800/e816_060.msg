There's the container!

[msg MSG_001 [Yusuke]]
Now to look for that "Next-Gen[n]Mechanism"!

[msg MSG_002 [Koromaru]]
Arf, arf!

[msg MSG_003]
We looked inside the container...

[msg MSG_004 [Junpei]]
Sheesh, nothin' but dust and mold... and[n]now we're covered in it.

[msg MSG_005 [Akechi]]
It seems the container's been left like[n]this for some time.

[msg MSG_006 [Ryuji]]
Well, we pulled everything out, but it[n]looks like it's all just a buncha crap.

[msg MSG_007 [Naoto]]
......
...Wait, what's this!?
The excellent wiring, this exceptional[n]design... What could this possibly be[n]used for?

[msg MSG_008 [Yusuke]]
It looks somewhat worn, but its aura is[n]incredibly unique!
There's no doubt about it! This is what[n]we were looking for!

[msg MSG_009 [Naoto]]
I think so too! So, this connects to[n]here...

Looks like you're having fun.

[msg MSG_011 [Yusuke]]
Hold on, I'm going to try and capture[n]the inspiration I felt when I first laid[n]eyes upon it!

[msg MSG_012 [Naoto]]
This material is rather peculiar... Is[n]it some kind of alloy? What's the mixing[n]ratio, I wonder?

[msg MSG_013 [Morgana]]
Aw, man... They're gonna be a while.

[msg MSG_014 [Naoto]]
This material is rather peculiar... Is[n]it some kind of alloy? What's the mixing[n]ratio, I wonder?

[msg MSG_015 [Yusuke]]
All right, I'm going to try and capture[n]the inspiration I felt when I first laid[n]eyes upon it!

[msg MSG_016 [Morgana]]
Man, they're in their own world right[n]now... This could be a while.

[msg MSG_017 [Fuuka]]
Aw, that's not fair... I want to see it[n]too!

[msg MSG_018 [Futaba]]
C'mon, the techie here wants a turn. We[n]can't leave her out of it.
Hey, you mecha nerds, come back here[n]when you're done.

[msg MSG_019 [Yusuke]]
Hahaha! I could sketch this forever!
This is a wellspring of inspiration![n]What a truly amazing device!

[msg MSG_020 [Naoto]]
...Oh, I see! The drive system absorbs[n]the energy here then converts it here[n]and...
