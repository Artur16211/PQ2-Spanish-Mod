[msg MSG_000 [Elizabeth]]
Now then, the goal of this special[n]screening is to...
Steal the Seidoptera's treasure!

[msg MSG_001 [Morgana]]
T-Treasure!?

[msg MSG_002 [Makoto]]
I don't think it's the kind of treasure[n]we're familiar with.

[msg MSG_003 [Akechi]]
Right. This isn't a Palace, so perhaps[n]it's something like gold or silver?

[msg MSG_004 [Elizabeth]]
According to the ticket, the target is a[n]pair of Golden Crowns.

[msg MSG_005 [Ryuji]]
Aw yeah! Now THAT sounds like treasure!

[msg MSG_006 [Elizabeth]]
Yes. Please steal the flying dinosaurs'[n]hidden treasures, and bring them here.

[msg MSG_007 [Yosuke]]
Wait, those things are FOEs, right?
If we try to take 'em head-on, we'll[n]probably just end up as dinosaur food.[n]How we supposed to get the treasure?

[sel SEL_008 top]
We don't need to fight.
We train until we can beat them.

[msg MSG_009 [Chie]]
Huh? How do we get the treasure, then?

[msg MSG_010 [Morgana]]
Nyahaha... We're the Phantom Thieves. We[n]gotta do things in style.

[msg MSG_011 [Chie]]
Ohh, training, huh? Okay, I'll do my[n]best!

[msg MSG_012 [Morgana]]
Hey, come on, we can do better than[n]that. We're the Phantom Thieves, aren't[n]we?

[msg MSG_013 [Makoto]]
That's true. The Seidopteras might not[n]be carrying their treasures with them.
If we can figure out where they are...

[msg MSG_014 [Futaba]]
Then, we move in and take 'em! Business[n]as usual!

[msg MSG_015 [Chie]]
Wow, you really do sound like phantom[n]thieves! This is so exciting!

[msg MSG_016 [Elizabeth]]
Please use this to carry the treasure.
It's a pouch that Theo crafted himself.

[msg MSG_017 [Ann]]
Whoa, Theodore made this? He's so[n]talented.

[msg MSG_018 [Elizabeth]]
Yes. He came to me with tears in his[n]eyes and begged me to make use of it.

[msg MSG_019 [Futaba]]
It's obvious you're lying when you smile[n]like that.

[msg MSG_020 [Elizabeth]]
That reminds me...
Where there are phantom thieves, there[n]is treasure, and vice versa. These two[n]are deeply and inseparably linked.
I look forward to finally seeing the[n]Phantom Thieves showcase their true[n]abilities.
Dancing through the air, dashing across[n]the ground! Everywhere and nowhere at[n]the same time!

[msg MSG_021 [Haru]]
Um, I don't know if we can do all[n]that...

[msg MSG_022 [Elizabeth]]
You mustn't give up. "I think I can! I[n]think I can!"
I believe in all of you! Now, go!

[msg MSG_023 [Makoto]]
You're really putting on the pressure...[n]At this point, it's kind of hard to say[n]we can't do it...

[msg MSG_024 [Ann]]
Uh, we should definitely say, "We think[n]we can't."

[msg MSG_025 [Morgana]]
Hmm, Miss Elizabeth sort of borrowed[n]those words from somewhere else, but I[n]think it's working! I'm all fired up!
It's only natural for a phantom thief to[n]be drawn to treasure, after all!
Nya-hoo! Treasuuure!

[msg MSG_026 [Teddie]]
Oho! Morgana's looking beary motivated!

[msg MSG_027 [Yosuke]]
It's like someone slipped him some[n]catnip...

[msg MSG_028 [Morgana]]
I'm. Not. A. CAT! N-O-T! You got that!?

[msg MSG_029 [Yukiko]]
Yes. You. Are. C-A-T!

[msg MSG_030 [Morgana]]
Noooooo...

[msg MSG_031 [Ryuji]]
Haha, you're gettin' way too excited.
Well, I ain't at Morgana's level, but[n]I'm kinda hyped myself, y'know?

[msg MSG_032 [Chie]]
Huh? Really, Ryuji-kun? Are you getting[n]all catnippy too?

[msg MSG_033 [Ryuji]]
I'm not a cat! ...Did I really just say[n]that?
Yo, remember how, earlier, I was sayin'[n]we haven't done any real phantom thief[n]work in awhile?

[msg MSG_034 [Chie]]
Oh yeah, you were! But now we get to do[n]just that!

[msg MSG_035 [Ryuji]]
This ain't a typical setting like a bank[n]or a museum, though.
Still, I think this movie'll be the[n]perfect place for us to do our thing.

[msg MSG_036 [Chie]]
And then you fight the Seidopteras in[n]midair and snag the treasure, right?
Yeah! Sounds nice and thief-y!

[msg MSG_037 [Yusuke]]
...I doubt we're capable of that.

[msg MSG_038 [Futaba]]
Wait, you guys are planning on fighting[n]the Seidopteras? You know those are[n]FOEs, don't you?

[msg MSG_039 [Elizabeth]]
Things are really heating up now. I[n]shall be here, watching with bated[n]breath.
Go, go, Phantom Thieves! Go get that[n]treasure!
...And there you have it.

[sel SEL_040 top]
Let's begin.
That treasure's ours!

[msg MSG_041 [Ryuji]]
Oh, you're lookin' pretty pumped up too,[n][f 6 1 30 0 0 0]. Gotta say, it's the first time[n]I've felt this way in awhile.

[msg MSG_042 [Teddie]]
Me too! I'll show everyone the[n]Teddie-way of phantom thievery!

[msg MSG_043 [Morgana]]
All right, let's move out. Make sure[n]we're ready.
