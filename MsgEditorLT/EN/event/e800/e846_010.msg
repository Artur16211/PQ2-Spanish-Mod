[msg MSG_000 [Elizabeth]]
Let's see... This special screening is a[n]bit different than the usual.
Well, that is to say...
Your goal will be to retrieve music from[n]Hikari's movie.

[msg MSG_001 [Akechi]]
Retrieve music...? Is that metaphorical?

[msg MSG_002 [Elizabeth]]
No indeed! It was quite literal. I meant[n]it just as I said.
That said, music has no physical form,[n]so it would be difficult to bring back.
So please, take a look at this.

[msg MSG_003 [Naoto]]
A music box?

[msg MSG_004 [Elizabeth]]
Yes. Though it currently holds no music,[n]I'm afraid.

[msg MSG_005 [Akechi]]
Aha, I think I see...
So we're supposed to put the music into[n]the music box, and bring it back that[n]way?

[msg MSG_006 [Elizabeth]]
Ding ding ding! We have a winner!

[msg MSG_006_1 [Elizabeth]]
If you want to know more, please head to[n]the movie and figure it out for[n]yourselves.

[msg MSG_007 [Yosuke]]
What!? Don't just skip the most[n]important part! I don't know why I[n]expected any different...

[msg MSG_008 [Elizabeth]]
What kind of music will it play...? I[n]will await on tenterhooks until you[n]bring it forth.

[msg MSG_009 [P3 Fem Protag]]
A music box... That's it!

[msg MSG_009_1 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hey, Fuuka, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]-kun! Wouldn't this[n]work perfectly for that thing we were[n]talking about?
You know, the thing for Ann!

[sel SEL_010 top]
What thing?
For cheering her up?

[msg MSG_011 [P3 Fem Protag]]
The thing about helping Ann feel better![n]I think music would be a great idea.

[msg MSG_012 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Yeah! Music always helps, right?

[msg MSG_013 [Fuuka]]
Yes, that sounds like a great idea. A[n]good song can do a lot for your mood...

[msg MSG_014 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Let's get this music in the music box,[n]and then give it to Ann as a present.

[msg MSG_014_1 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I'll just sidle up to Elizabeth and ask[n]if it's cool to give it to Ann...

[msg MSG_015 [Ann]]
Huh? Did someone say my name?

[msg MSG_016 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Huh? Oh uh, don't mind us! N-Nothing to[n]see here!

[msg MSG_017 [Ann]]
Uh, you realize that makes you even more[n]suspicious...

[msg MSG_018 [Elizabeth]]
Oh, one very important detail I[n]neglected to mention.

[msg MSG_018_1 [Elizabeth]]
The music within the movie is an[n]ephemeral, delicate thing...

[msg MSG_018_2 [Elizabeth]]
Even after capturing the music, it will[n]disappear if too much time passes.

[msg MSG_019 [Akechi]]
Meaning there's a time limit, then?

[msg MSG_020 [Elizabeth]]
Correct. In order to successfully bring[n]the music back, you must do it "within[n]46 steps of capturing it."
Be warned that if the music ends up[n]disappearing from the box, you will have[n]to go back and try again.
In addition, it seems that using a[n]Goho-M or a Goba-K will also dispel the[n]music.
A song is such a delicate thing.

[msg MSG_020_1 [Elizabeth]]
Now then, I eagerly await my chance to[n]hear the song once it is safely in your[n]hands.

[msg MSG_021 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Okay, let's get out there and make this[n]a success!
