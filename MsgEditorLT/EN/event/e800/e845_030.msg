W-Wait, stop! Joker, this is bad!

[sel SEL_001 top]
What happened?
Calm down.

[msg MSG_002 [Fuuka]]
It looks like... there's another of[n]those bear FOEs out there!

[msg MSG_003 [P4 Hero]]
What?

[msg MSG_004 [Aigis]]
This situation is indeed suboptimal.[n]Which target do we attack first?

[msg MSG_005 [Teddie]]
Huh? Well, we'll just beat both, right?

[msg MSG_006 [Yosuke]]
Dude, you can't just say that! You think[n]we can just take both of them at once!?

[msg MSG_007 [Teddie]]
Maybe YOU can't, but she definitely said[n]this would be a "double bear-relled[n]battle"!

[msg MSG_007_1 [Teddie]]
If we don't beat two at once, then the[n]tagline wouldn't make sense.

[msg MSG_008 [Aigis]]
Double bear-relled...
We have a single bear on our side, and[n]the enemy possesses two.

[msg MSG_008_1 [Aigis]]
In other words, the FOEs are the double[n]bears in question. I see.

[msg MSG_009 [Teddie]]
Yeah, just like I told Ellie-chan! Now,[n]put 'em up! We'll see who's the last[n]bear standing!

[msg MSG_010 [P4 Hero]]
Somehow... I can feel Elizabeth[n]smirking, even from over here.

[msg MSG_010_1 [P4 Hero]]
Either way, it looks like we'll have to[n]beat two of them. Stay on guard,[n]everyone.
