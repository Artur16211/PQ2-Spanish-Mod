[msg MSG_000 [Elizabeth]]
Well, I imagine you're all used to this:[n]I have another special screening!
You've made good use of the resources[n]here. As the proprietor, I must say I'm[n]proud.

[msg MSG_000_1 [Elizabeth]]
And now, the time has come to raise the[n]curtain on a very special screening!

[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
Oh, one of those specific-cast ones? So[n]we're fighting a big one again, huh?

[msg MSG_002 [Elizabeth]]
*chuckle* I see this is routine for you[n]by now. Yes, you're correct.

[msg MSG_002_1 [Elizabeth]]
This time, your brutal deathmatch is[n]against a villain who has appeared in[n]the depths of "A.I.G.I.S."
Please crush the living hell out of it[n]and then return to me.

[sel SEL_003 top]
Consider it crushed.
This is getting old.

[msg MSG_004 [Elizabeth]]
My, you're brimming with confidence.
Or perhaps you're more focused on the[n]bout beyond this task...?

[msg MSG_005 [Morgana]]
Well, it's true this is just an opener[n]for the real battle. But we can't let[n]our guard down.

[msg MSG_006 [P3 Hero]]
Yeah. Doesn't matter who we're up[n]against. We'll fight with all we've got.

[msg MSG_007 [Elizabeth]]
Grrr... Then again, this would be the[n]third one. I suppose anyone might be[n]losing their zeal by now.

[msg MSG_008 [Morgana]]
C'mon, don't be like that. The Phantom[n]Thieves have to take on anyone in their[n]way!

[msg MSG_009 [P3 Hero]]
Haha... That's just your style, huh?[n]Guess I've got to step up my game.

[msg MSG_010 [Elizabeth]]
Your chance may come sooner than you[n]think, [f 6 1 16 0 0].

[msg MSG_010_1 [Elizabeth]]
As it happens, your name is the one[n]written on this ticket.

[msg MSG_011 [P3 Hero]]
Huh. Well, okay. Guess that means I'm up[n]for the next battle.

[msg MSG_012 [P3 Hero]]
Let's do this, Leader. Sounds like a[n]pretty big responsibility, but I'll give[n]it a shot.

[sel SEL_013 top]
Show me your best.
I know you can do it.

[msg MSG_014 [P3 Hero]]
Of course. I owe you, anyway. Gotta[n]repay you for saving my life.

[msg MSG_014_1 [P3 Hero]]
Well, it's going to be as tough as the[n]last ones were. Let's work together and[n]take it out.
