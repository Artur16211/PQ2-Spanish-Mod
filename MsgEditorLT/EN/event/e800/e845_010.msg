[msg MSG_000 [Elizabeth]]
Thank you all for waiting.
I would like to let you know that the[n]special screening you all requested is[n]now ready.

[sel SEL_001 top]
Wait, what request?
I don't remember...

[msg MSG_002 [Elizabeth]]
Hm? How curious...

[msg MSG_002_1 [Elizabeth]]
I was sure I heard you all wanted to[n]fight an FOE in Hikari's movie.

[msg MSG_003 [Hikari]]
The FOE in my movie...? You mean the[n]cute teddie bear?

[msg MSG_004 [Teddie]]
Oh, over here! You were looking for a[n]beary adorable Teddie bear?

[msg MSG_005 [Hikari]]
Oh, not you, Teddie... It is a bear, but[n]it's the bear from my movie, so...

[msg MSG_006 [Teddie]]
Awww... How can Hikarin bear that[n]unbearable ab-bearation, but still think[n]I'm overbearing...?

[msg MSG_007 [P4 Hero]]
Just grin and bear it, Teddie. That bear[n]bear-ly has the bearlike bearing you[n]bear.

[msg MSG_008 [Aigis]]
Approaching speeds of fifteen bears per[n]minute.

[msg MSG_009 [Yosuke]]
Look, jokes aside... Are we seriously[n]fighting this bear? Who even put in that[n]request...?

[msg MSG_010 [Elizabeth]]
Why, Teddie here assured me that[n]everyone already agreed to this.

[msg MSG_011 [Teddie]]
Hrmm... I guess I did say that.

[msg MSG_012 [Yosuke]]
It was you!? You can't just make these[n]decisions on your own!

[msg MSG_013 [Teddie]]
Aw, c'mon! Don't you guys want to find[n]out who's the bearest of them all?

[msg MSG_014 [Yosuke]]
Don't drag us into your weird bear[n]complex!

[msg MSG_015 [P4 Hero]]
Don't get too worked up, Yosuke.

[msg MSG_015_1 [P4 Hero]]
It'll be a powerful opponent, but it's[n]always good when we can learn from a[n]tough fight.

[msg MSG_016 [Yosuke]]
Well, yeah... I guess so, but...

[msg MSG_017 [Aigis]]
Right. Teddie-san, you aim to prepare[n]yourself for even greater battles ahead,[n]do you not?

[msg MSG_018 [Teddie]]
Absolutely, positively! Sensei, Ai-chan,[n]you two totally get me!

[msg MSG_019 [Yosuke]]
*sigh* ...You seriously need to learn[n]when to stop talking.

[msg MSG_020 [Yosuke]]
A fight against that bear FOE, huh...?[n]What do you say, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]?

[sel SEL_021 top]
Let's take it on.
Might as well.

[msg MSG_022 [Teddie]]
Yaaay! That settles it! This bear's all[n]hyped up and ready to go!

[msg MSG_023 [Yosuke]]
Sorry about this. We didn't mean to drag[n]you into our dumb bear's shenanigans.

[msg MSG_024 [Elizabeth]]
Has it been decided?

[msg MSG_024_1 [Elizabeth]]
Let us begin! It's time for a Teddie[n]Showdown! Double bear-relled battle![n]Lights, camera, action!

[msg MSG_025 [Teddie]]
Action!

[msg MSG_026 [Aigis]]
23 bears-per-minute action!

[msg MSG_027 [P4 Hero]]
Uh, are we making this a thing...?[n]Action!

[msg MSG_028 [Hikari]]
You're going up against a pretty tough[n]bear. It sure will be action!

[msg MSG_029 [Yosuke]]
Ugh... now "bear"'s lost all meaning...
