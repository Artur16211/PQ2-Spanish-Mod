Foraging onward on a treasure hunt for[n]the ages, the team finds a cache of[n]untold riches!
How did you enjoy this fantastical[n]treasure hunt? Were you swimming in[n]coins, like a rich tycoon?

[msg MSG_001 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Well... It didn't happen like that,[n]but... we definitely found a bunch of[n]treasure.

[msg MSG_002 [Elizabeth]]
Indeed, I must commend you for your[n]sense of calm and responsibility.
Why, nobody even complained about the[n]relative mundanity of this task...
And nobody rushed ahead recklessly,[n]blinded by the prospect of riches.

[msg MSG_003 [Junpei]]
What? What're you talking about?

[msg MSG_004 [Ryuji]]
Huh... Does that happen in movies?

[msg MSG_005 [Morgana]]
Haha! Sounds like a rookie mistake.[n]That's definitely not us.

[msg MSG_006 [Shinjiro]]
Heh... Someone put out those fires[n]before they got outta control.
Guess that's thanks to those two.

[msg MSG_007 [Mitsuru]]
I've heard you're fond of gardening? Not[n]just horticultural theoryâ€•you even care[n]for the flowerbeds.

[msg MSG_008 [Haru]]
Oh, you make it sound so impressive![n]It's little more than a hobby, really...

[msg MSG_009 [Mitsuru]]
I'm currently trying to devise a plan[n]for my own garden. Do you suppose you[n]could give me some advice?

[msg MSG_010 [Haru]]
*giggle* I'd be more than happy to. I'll[n]consult some gardener friends...

[sel SEL_011 top]
What's going on?
Double empresses?

[msg MSG_012 [Shinjiro]]
Not much we can do against it. No matter[n]how much power we got, we can't beat[n]that aura.

[msg MSG_013 [Yusuke]]
Hm... It's difficult to describe with[n]words. They have some natural ability to[n]command others...
So that must be what charisma is. I[n]suppose it's a skill, in its own way.

[sel SEL_014 top]
I still don't get it.
I want to be like that.

[msg MSG_015 [Shinjiro]]
Hah... I guess it's hard to explain.

[msg MSG_016 [Shinjiro]]
Hah. It's not something you can just[n]learn to be. Don't worry about it.

[msg MSG_017 [Shinjiro]]
They both think pretty highly of you,[n]anyway. Have some confidence.

[msg MSG_018 [Haru]]
Ah, so your passions lie with tea!

[msg MSG_019 [Mitsuru]]
I'm more of an enthusiast than an[n]authority, but you're welcome to join me[n]for a cup.
I keep some fine leaves on me for such[n]occasions. I'd be happy to share with[n]someone who appreciates them.

[msg MSG_020 [Haru]]
Oh, most certainly! I'd be delighted to[n]provide some scones.
You see, there's this pastry shop run by[n]a friend of the family since my[n]grandfather's days...

[msg MSG_021 [Mitsuru]]
Oh? That does sound promising. I'd be[n]more than happy to sit down for a[n]discussion sometime.

[msg MSG_022 [Chie]]
H-Hey, do they live in a totally[n]different world from us...?
Don't lose, Yosuke! Fight for the pride[n]of Junes!

[msg MSG_023 [Yosuke]]
Uh, screw that! We're there for the[n]commoners!

[msg MSG_024 [Haru]]
Oh, everyone else is welcome too!

[msg MSG_025 [Mitsuru]]
Yes. Perhaps when all this is taken care[n]of, a small party is in order.

[msg MSG_026 [Chie]]
Really!? All right! Time for a barbecue[n]party! Goblets full of steak sauce!

[msg MSG_027 [Yosuke]]
They said it's a tea party! If you're[n]gonna guzzle steak sauce, do it[n]somewhere else!

[msg MSG_028 [Shinjiro]]
Mitsuru used to be so detached from the[n]rest of us, nobody would ever talk to[n]her. But now...
Looks like she's doing pretty good for[n]herself. I guess things are finally[n]starting to change.

[msg MSG_029 [Yusuke]]
It's a relief to see that gentleness in[n]Haru's expression again...
They say meeting new people changes our[n]outlook. I suppose we should cherish[n]these encounters...
