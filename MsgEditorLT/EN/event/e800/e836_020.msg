Now, let us gather these parts.
Our quarry this time would be the[n]Roaring Turrets, then? Are they nearby?

[msg MSG_001 [Fuuka]]
Looks like these Roaring Turrets are[n]around the southwest part of the map...
My readings say there's a large group by[n]the security gates!

[msg MSG_002 [Rise]]
Let's head there first!
We need three of those Futuristic[n]Gizmos!

[msg MSG_003 [Kanji]]
Sounds pretty simple... Okay, let's tear[n]'em apart!

[msg MSG_004 [Futaba]]
Just don't go crazy out there, okay?[n]Good luck, guys!
