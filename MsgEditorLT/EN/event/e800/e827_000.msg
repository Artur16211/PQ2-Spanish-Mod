[msg MSG_000 [Elizabeth]]
...However, [f 6 1 16 0 0]'s stomach truly knows[n]no limit.
Certainly, I believe his gastronomic[n]capacity is far beyond that of ordinary[n]humans...

[msg MSG_001 [Margaret]]
I wonder. You'll find my guest has quite[n]an uncanny skill for it as well.

[msg MSG_002 [Junpei]]
Yikes, sparks are flyin'. Are those two[n]glaring at each other?

[msg MSG_003 [Theodore]]
Well, it began innocently enough...
They were discussing the capabilities of[n]their respective guests, and [f 6 1 13 0 0 0]...
They could not agree on who was the more[n]voracious eater, and now it's become[n]quite an argument.

[msg MSG_004 [Yosuke]]
How does this stuff happen...?
Geez. If those two aren't even here,[n]this is just gonna go on forever.

[sel SEL_005 top]
Let's call them over.
Hey, [f 6 1 16 0 0]!
Hey, [f 6 1 13 0 0 0]!

[msg MSG_006 [P3 Hero]]
...I have a bad feeling about this.

[msg MSG_007 [P4 Hero]]
Yeah. I'm starting to think we need an[n]escape plan...

[msg MSG_008 [Margaret]]
Ah, there you are.

[msg MSG_009 [P3 Hero]]
...Too late, I guess.

[msg MSG_010 [P4 Hero]]
Ah, geez...

[msg MSG_011 [Elizabeth]]
Allow me to explain. The fact is, et[n]cetera, et cetera, et cetera...
We would like to decide the winner[n]between you two once and for all.

[msg MSG_012 [P3 Hero]]
This is pretty short notice...

[msg MSG_013 [Margaret]]
The rules are simple.
Your only task is to eat as much as you[n]can within the allotted time.

[sel SEL_014 top]
Sounds easy enough.
Oh, this'll be good.
Eating what?

[msg MSG_015 [Chie]]
Yeah, it's like an all-you-can-eat[n]contest. But what food do we even have[n]around here?

[msg MSG_016 [Ann]]
You're not joining in, are you?

[msg MSG_017 [Makoto]]
Please don't complicate this further...
Besides, do we even have that much food[n]for them to eat?

[msg MSG_018 [Haru]]
We have a lot of popcorn, but I'm not[n]sure that's suitable for a competition[n]like this...

[msg MSG_019 [P3 Hero]]
Ah, what a shame. And we don't have[n]cooking supplies, either. Guess it's[n]impossible―

[msg MSG_020 [Hikari]]
We... might have some cooking supplies.

[msg MSG_021 [P3 Hero]]
...Oh. That's just... great.

[msg MSG_022 [Hikari]]
I think I saw some at the concession[n]stand... One moment...

[msg MSG_023 [Hikari]]
This is it...

[msg MSG_024 [Chie]]
A square tray thing?

[msg MSG_025 [Fuuka]]
Oh... This is a sieve for a deep fryer.

[msg MSG_026 [Chie]]
Oh! We can deep fry some stuff! Let's[n]make some fried chicken! Or maybe even[n]some croquettes!

[msg MSG_027 [Shinjiro]]
We wouldn't have the ingredients for[n]that. All we've got is a ton of flour...

[sel SEL_028 top]
Donuts?
Udon?
Soba?

[msg MSG_029 [Shinjiro]]
Yeah, that'll work fine.

[msg MSG_030 [Shinjiro]]
You don't fry that, genius. And we don't[n]have any soup.
Guess we could make donuts or something.

[msg MSG_031 [Chie]]
I like that! I'll eat as much as you[n]guys can make!

[msg MSG_032 [Shinjiro]]
Not happening. It's not made with flour,[n]and it's not fried.
Guess we could make donuts or something.

[msg MSG_033 [Ann]]
Donuts...!

[msg MSG_034 [P4 Hero]]
Fried, heavy dough!?

[msg MSG_035 [Elizabeth]]
Then it is decided. Here begins the[n]grandest donut-eating competition of[n]all―

[msg MSG_036 [Theodore]]
Um, Sister... I do apologize for[n]interrupting, but...
I believe the deep fryer needs some more[n]parts before it'll function.

[msg MSG_037 [Elizabeth]]
......

[msg MSG_038 [Margaret]]
Then I suppose the verdict will have to[n]wait.

[msg MSG_039 [Elizabeth]]
Yes... None can escape our final[n]judgment.

[msg MSG_040 [P3 Hero]]
Final... judgment?

[msg MSG_041 [Elizabeth]]
Oh? It appears another special screening[n]has been added.
This mission's objective is to obtain[n]two Cognitive Devices in A.I.G.I.S.

[msg MSG_042 [Theodore]]
Ah! That's exactly what we need to fix[n]the fryer.

[sel SEL_043 top]
A little too perfect...
What a coincidence.

[msg MSG_044 [Margaret]]
Yes... Most fortuitous indeed.

[msg MSG_045 [P4 Hero]]
......

[msg MSG_046 [Elizabeth]]
This task will not only earn you the[n]standard reward...
You will win the chance at all the[n]donuts you can eat!

[msg MSG_047 [Futaba]]
Whoa!

[msg MSG_048 [Yusuke]]
All we can eat!?

[msg MSG_049 [Elizabeth]]
It seems their hopes lie with you.

[msg MSG_050 [P3 Hero]]
......

[msg MSG_051 [Elizabeth]]
So I do hope that you all accept this[n]mission.

[msg MSG_052]
A new special screening: "Wildcard[n]Buffet" has been added to the box[n]office.
