Now then, for this special screening,[n]you will seek a lost, but most cherished[n]possession of Hikari's...
The only wrinkle is... nobody knows what[n]she lost!

[msg MSG_001 [Hikari]]
I know it was really, really special.

[msg MSG_002 [Elizabeth]]
Twinkle, twinkle, item of Hikari, how I[n]wonder what you might be...
Somewhere in her movie's scene, like a[n]film star on the screen...
But I digress. I imagine you will need[n]to look around for likely contenders in[n]the movie.

[msg MSG_003 [Yosuke]]
You really think we should go in with no[n]idea what we're looking for?
I guess we can handle the fighting and[n]exploring, but... Will you know what[n]we're looking for, Hikari-chan?

[msg MSG_004 [Hikari]]
...Yeah, I think I'm slowly starting to[n]remember. Sorry I can't be more reliable[n]than that.

[msg MSG_005 [Junpei]]
No need to feel guilty! Relax, relax!

[msg MSG_006 [Makoto]]
So the movie we're entering is "Hikari,"[n]right?
Can you at least remember where in the[n]movie it might be?

[msg MSG_007 [Hikari]]
I'm sorry... I don't know...

[msg MSG_008 [Elizabeth]]
And on that discouraging note, let's all[n]pay attention to me now, shall we?
According to this super-secret book that[n]never leaves my hands...
The flowers in that movie might give you[n]a clue to the whereabouts of your[n]quarry.

[msg MSG_009 [Ryuji]]
The flowers? You mean those things with[n]faces? That look like singing toys?

[msg MSG_010 [Hikari]]
They can give clues? What do you mean?

[msg MSG_011 [Elizabeth]]
What do I mean? Not even I know, hehe.[n]You'll just have to go out there and[n]see.

[msg MSG_012 [Junpei]]
Yeah, we'll figure it out once we get[n]there, guys! I mean, seein' is[n]believin', right?
Uh, as long as someone else figures out[n]how to get there! Where are we going[n]again?
