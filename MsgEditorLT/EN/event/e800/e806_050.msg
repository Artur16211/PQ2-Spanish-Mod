[msg MSG_000 [Ann]]
Well, here we are. I'm sure we'll find[n]one this time!

[msg MSG_001 [Yusuke]]
Right! I'll find an ammonite no matter[n]what it takes!

[msg MSG_002 [Ryuji]]
Dude, I can't find crap... I mean, what[n]the hell even is an ammonite anyways?

[sel SEL_003 top]
No idea.
It's like a conch shell.
A creature from outer space.

[msg MSG_004 [Yosuke]]
You mean you've been looking for it[n]without actually knowing what it is!?

[msg MSG_005 [Makoto]]
*sigh* An ammonite is a type of shelled[n]sea creature.
More specifically, it's like a squid or[n]an octopus that lives inside a shell.

[msg MSG_006 [Makoto]]
Correct, an ammonite is a type of[n]shelled sea creature.
More specifically, it's like a squid or[n]an octopus that lives inside a shell.

[msg MSG_007 [Kanji]]
No foolin'!?

[msg MSG_008 [Makoto]]
It might look like it, but it's actually[n]not! It's a type of shelled sea[n]creature.
More specifically, it's like a squid or[n]an octopus that lives inside a shell.

[msg MSG_009 [Yusuke]]
Squid and octopus... I'm getting hungry[n]just hearing about it.

[msg MSG_010 [Yukiko]]
You know, Fox, your attachment to food[n]is really amazing.

[msg MSG_011 [Yusuke]]
I lost my parents when I was young and,[n]as a result, had a difficult time with[n]money.
There was a man who once looked after[n]me, but for many reasons, I've found[n]myself alone once again.

[msg MSG_012 [Yukiko]]
Oh... I'm sorry to hear that.

[msg MSG_013 [Yusuke]]
No, it's quite all right. Currently, art[n]supplies are my biggest expense...
Those I cannot do without. Even if it[n]were to mean eating grass again.

[msg MSG_014 [Yukiko]]
You sure are passionate.

[msg MSG_015 [Yusuke]]
Well, I wouldn't be this way if I were[n]truly by myself.
I've had a lot support from my friends.[n]They saved me and gave me a place to[n]belong.

[msg MSG_016 [Yukiko]]
I think I understand now.
The reason I can be myself is because[n]I'm surrounded by people who accept me[n]for who I am.

[msg MSG_017 [Yusuke]]
That's right. Passion or not, I can't do[n]it alone.
I don't know how many times I've been[n]fed by the cafã€’ Joker's staying at...

[msg MSG_018 [Yukiko]]
I feel like that's a little different...
Oh, but if you're short on food, why[n]don't I make you something to say[n]thanks?

[msg MSG_019 [Yusuke]]
What!? Are you sure!?

[msg MSG_020 [Chie]]
Heeey! You two find anything?

[msg MSG_021 [Yukiko]]
No, not yet.

[msg MSG_022 [Naoto]]
Then, perhaps we should change location.
Rise-san said she sensed more water west[n]of here.

[msg MSG_023 [Yukiko]]
Then, that's where we'll head next![n]Let's go, Fox!

[msg MSG_024 [Yusuke]]
Yes, let's!

[msg MSG_025 [Chie]]
Hey, wait up, you two! Don't tell me[n]Yukiko's all art-crazy now too?

[msg MSG_026 [Futaba]]
I guess Fox's really made an impression[n]on her...
Either way, we've got more water to the[n]west. Let's go check it out!
