[msg MSG_000 [Elizabeth]]
Bravo, bravo. My hat is off to your[n]investigational skills.

[msg MSG_001 [Junpei]]
You really gave us a hard time, y'know.[n]It was tough figurin' it all out with[n]next to no info.

[msg MSG_001_1 [Junpei]]
But the people of Kamo City can sleep[n]soundly tonight, thanks to me...

[sel SEL_002 top]
Junpei, Ace Detective?
......

[msg MSG_003 [Mitsuru]]
...J-Junpei, Ace Detective...

[msg MSG_004 [Junpei]]
Huh?

[msg MSG_005 [Yukari]]
What the...!?

[msg MSG_006 [Mitsuru]]
...I just had a feeling you were going[n]to say that.

[sel SEL_007 top]
That's thinking like Junpei.
Are you feeling okay?
That was beautiful...

[msg MSG_008 [Mitsuru]]
Will you stop talking about it!?

[msg MSG_009 [Mitsuru]]
Y-You said I should try it, so I did...

[msg MSG_010 [Mitsuru]]
Don't act like it's so moving...!

[msg MSG_011 [Ryuji]]
Well, we really only solved the case[n]because of all the info we got from the[n]people around town.

[msg MSG_012 [Ann]]
I don't think they would've ever done[n]something like that before. They really[n]have changed.

[msg MSG_013 [Junpei]]
Guess the most important thing is the[n]guy in charge. That's just the way of[n]the world.

[msg MSG_014 [Yukari]]
Because you know so much about that...

[msg MSG_015 [Elizabeth]]
Now then, here is your reward. Please[n]accept it.

[msg MSG_016 [Mitsuru]]
Pardon me, but I'd like you to have[n]these.

[msg MSG_017 [Makoto]]
Gloves?

[msg MSG_018 [Mitsuru]]
They're motorcycle gloves. I wanted to[n]thank you for everything you did for me[n]this time around.

[msg MSG_019 [Makoto]]
You don't need to thank me... Besides, I[n]don't even have my license yet.

[msg MSG_020 [Mitsuru]]
Really? After seeing your Persona, I[n]assumed...

[msg MSG_021 [Makoto]]
I think it's just a representation of[n]how I feel.

[msg MSG_021_1 [Makoto]]
Responsibility, regulations... I just[n]want to throw all of those things away[n]and take off at full speed.

[msg MSG_022 [Mitsuru]]
It seems we both carry a similar burden[n]after all.

[msg MSG_022_1 [Mitsuru]]
I feel the same sense of freedom when[n]I'm riding my motorcycle.

[msg MSG_022_2 [Mitsuru]]
I won't force you to accept these[n]gloves, but...

[msg MSG_022_3 [Mitsuru]]
Seeing as you bear the same burden as[n]me, I want you to know that feeling of[n]the wind on your face someday.

[msg MSG_023 [Makoto]]
Kirijo-san...

[msg MSG_023_1 [Makoto]]
Thank you. What do you say we both take[n]our bikes out somewhere, once I get my[n]license?

[msg MSG_024 [Mitsuru]]
Of course. Once we're back in the real[n]world...

[msg MSG_024_1 [Mitsuru]]
Let's ride together, full throttle!

[msg MSG_025 [Makoto]]
Yeah, that's a promise!
