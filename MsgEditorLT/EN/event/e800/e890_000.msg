[msg MSG_000 [Elizabeth]]
Everyone, I apologize deeply for the[n]long wait.
I've studied that film you discovered,[n]and come up with some theories.

[sel SEL_001 top]
Let's hear it.
What did you find out?

[msg MSG_002 [Elizabeth]]
Well, please keep in mind that this is[n]mostly speculation, but...
In the special screening in question,[n]engaged in battle, as requested on its[n]ticket.
The film was left behind by the Shadow[n]defeated by [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]'s might. In other[n]words...
I hypothesize that his power is directly[n]responsible for the film's appearance.

[sel SEL_003 top]
Which power?
I don't get it.

[msg MSG_004 [Elizabeth]]
I refer to your limitless possibilities.[n]What we call the power of the wild card.

[msg MSG_005 [Elizabeth]]
My, have you still not realized?
I refer to the limitless possibilities[n]slumbering within you. We know it as the[n]power of the wild card.

[msg MSG_006 [Elizabeth]]
And those with the power of the wild[n]card never gain such power without[n]reason.
In other words, that film is a key― one[n]meant to draw out further possibilities[n]from within you...

[msg MSG_007 [Akechi]]
Hmm... That seems like a bit of a reach[n]to me, but let's suppose this film[n]actually is a "key" to his power.

[msg MSG_007_1 [Akechi]]
himself doesn't seem to have changed[n]much... How do you explain that?

[msg MSG_008 [Elizabeth]]
......

[msg MSG_008_1 [Elizabeth]]
For the sake of answering this query,[n]allow me to offer an idea of my own.

[msg MSG_009 [Elizabeth]]
Theo! Theo! Come here at once!
Theo! Theooooo! Don't make me get the[n]soybean powder―

[msg MSG_010 [Theodore]]
Th-That's enough, Sister!

[msg MSG_010_1 [Theodore]]
Even the mere mention of it... I can[n]feel my tongue shriveling, drying into[n]lifeless dust...

[msg MSG_011 [Ryuji]]
The hell kinda PTSD is that...? What did[n]she do to you, man?

[msg MSG_012 [Theodore]]
Goodness! What a pleasant surprise to[n]see you all gathered here.
So, Sister? What did you need of me?

[msg MSG_013 [Elizabeth]]
Theo, surely you have not forgotten that[n]you are one who governs power?

[msg MSG_014 [Theodore]]
Why, certainly not.
However I may be dressed, I take pride[n]in performing my duties.

[msg MSG_015 [Elizabeth]]
Well then. Have a bout with them right[n]now.

[msg MSG_016 [Theodore]]
...Huh?

[msg MSG_016_1 [Theodore]]
A bout...? You want me to fight and his[n]companions!?

[msg MSG_017 [Elizabeth]]
Indeed! Naturally, there's no need to[n]hold back.
Of course, I ask the same of you all as[n]well. Please fight as if you wish to[n]kill him.

[sel SEL_018 top]
This makes no sense.
I'm totally lost.

[msg MSG_019 [Theodore]]
Yes, this is ridiculous. Look, they're[n]all struggling to keep up with you...

[msg MSG_020 [Elizabeth]]
Oh...?
Are you back-sassing me? I didn't know[n]you had such an attitude problem, Theo.

[msg MSG_021 [Theodore]]
O-Oh, no... Believe me, there was no[n]variety of sass intended...!

[msg MSG_022 [Elizabeth]]
, I truly apologize if this suggestion[n]is too sudden or brash...

[msg MSG_022_1 [Elizabeth]]
However, I believe this battle will bear[n]fruitful results indeed.
This is but a step to solving the[n]mystery of that film, and delving into[n]the possibilities of the wild card.

[msg MSG_023 [Theodore]]
This is for the power of the wild[n]card...?

[msg MSG_024 [Makoto]]
How is fighting Theodore going to solve[n]anything?

[msg MSG_025 [Elizabeth]]
I shall happily explain further once[n]you've beaten the crap out of Theo.

[msg MSG_025_1 [Elizabeth]]
Come now, and I shall witness it all![n]Theo VS. everyone! Round 1! FIGHT!

[msg MSG_026 [Futaba]]
Whoa, Zabby's hyped.

[msg MSG_027 [Theodore]]
...Well, I'm sure you know by now. Once[n]my sister seizes on an idea, there is[n]little point resisting.
Would you do as my sister says, and have[n]a bout with me?

[sel SEL_028 top]
Bring it on.
I'll need a moment.

[msg MSG_029 [Theodore]]
Understood.
I shall go prepare myself as well. Let[n]us meet in the Velvet Room.

[msg MSG_030 [Theodore]]
Of course. Please speak to me again once[n]you are prepared.

[msg MSG_031 [Theodore]]
Ah, welcome. Are you ready for our bout?

[sel SEL_032 top]
We're ready.
Not yet.

[msg MSG_033 [Theodore]]
Understood.
I shall go prepare myself as well. Let[n]us meet in the Velvet Room.

[msg MSG_034 [Theodore]]
In that case, please speak to me again[n]once you are prepared.
