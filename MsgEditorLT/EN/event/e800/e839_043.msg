Oh me, oh my, look at all of you. You[n]seek the "black thing," yes?

[msg MSG_001 [Smiling flower]]
Along a dark, blocked path, a house[n]stands a-swirl in wrath. Seen through a[n]door, infused with evil long ignored.

[msg MSG_002 [Shrill Flower]]
...Oh, but you must take care, great[n]care. For they are waiting in that[n]house.

[msg MSG_003 [Yosuke]]
Hey, I just thought of something. When[n]they say "blocked path," do they mean a[n]dead end?
A house located at a dead end... sweet,[n]I figured it out! And it's on the other[n]side of some door...
Hey, there was a door right by where we[n]came down, right? Wasn't it west of[n]here? Man, I'm on a roll!

[msg MSG_004 [Junpei]]
Dude, you are! Let's make our way over[n]there!
