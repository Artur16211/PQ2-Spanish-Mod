Welcome back! You did great, Naoto-kun,[n]Futaba-chan!

[msg MSG_001 [Makoto]]
Yes, I was very impressed with both[n]Futaba's memory and Shirogane-san's[n]analysis skills.
Thanks to you two, we were able to solve[n]the crime.

[sel SEL_002 top]
Good work!
A perfect pair.
It's all thanks to me.

[msg MSG_003 [Futaba]]
Ohh! You sound like a police chief!

[msg MSG_004 [Naoto]]
Thank you. It makes me happy to hear you[n]say that.
Of course, we mustn't forget we had your[n]help as well, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]-san.

[msg MSG_005 [Futaba]]
Yeah! Maybe we can make it a thing!

[msg MSG_006 [Naoto]]
*chuckle* You were a great partner,[n]Futaba-san. I would very much enjoy[n]working with you again.

[msg MSG_007 [Morgana]]
C'mon... Let them have their moment.

[msg MSG_008 [Naoto]]
*chuckle* Of course, we couldn't have[n]done it without your leadership,-san.

[msg MSG_009 [Haru]]
But detectives are so cool! I was[n]absolutely amazed!

[msg MSG_010 [Teddie]]
Me too! I wanna see more!

[msg MSG_011 [Rise]]
Oh, maybe Akechi-san can go next time.[n]It'll be the old Detective Prince versus[n]the new one!

[msg MSG_012 [Yukiko]]
Wow! That would be great! I bet they'd[n]solve the crime in no time!

[msg MSG_013 [Akechi]]
Haha. Hopefully, I can be of some help.
By the way, what I saw today was great.[n]It truly helped broaden my horizons.
Should we ever get the chance, allow me[n]to assist you, Detective Prince.

[msg MSG_014 [Naoto]]
I'd be honored. If the time comes,[n]please do.
