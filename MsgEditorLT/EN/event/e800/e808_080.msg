So that's the fake, huh? Let's get 'im!

[msg MSG_001 [Naoto]]
No, stay calm. We don't want to cause a[n]scene.
I'll go check with him one last time.[n]Please wait here.

[msg MSG_002 [Naoto]]
I'm sorry to say this, but your guess[n]was incorrect. He's a real police[n]officer.
And if he's lying, then it goes against[n]the condition that there's only one[n]liar.

[msg MSG_003 [Futaba]]
Hmm... This might be kinda hard. The[n]path to becoming an amazing detective[n]sure is tough.
What's the plan, Joker? You wanna go[n]over the info again?

[sel SEL_004 top]
If you don't mind.
There's no need.

[msg MSG_005 [Futaba]]
Okay! Here we go.

[msg MSG_006 [Futaba]]
Okay. You sure you got it this time?

[msg MSG_007 [Naoto]]
Then, let's keep going. Please head to[n]the police officer you believe to be[n]fake.

[msg MSG_008 [Futaba]]
So the first officer said...
"The fake officer is riding in a car[n]marked with double 1s."
His car's numbered 77-55.

[msg MSG_009 [Futaba]]
And the second one...
"The officer with the car numbered 77-55[n]is real."
He's in car 11-10.

[msg MSG_010 [Futaba]]
Third one says...
"The officer in the car with double 4s[n]is real."
His car is 11-22.

[msg MSG_011 [Futaba]]
Fourth one...
"The officer with double 7s is acting[n]suspicious."
The number on his car was 44-11.

[msg MSG_012 [Futaba]]
And finally there's the fifth one...
"The officer by car number 11-10 seems[n]suspicious to me."
His numbers are 11-77. Crit fails and[n]lucky sevens.

[msg MSG_013 [Futaba]]
That's all we got! Wanna hear it again?

[sel SEL_014 top]
Please.
I'm good.

[msg MSG_015 [Futaba]]
Roger! Pay attention now.

[msg MSG_016 [Futaba]]
Think about it again. Remember, only one[n]of them is lying.
