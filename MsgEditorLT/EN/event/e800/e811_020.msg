[msg MSG_000 [Morgana]]
All right, guys. First, we'll need to[n]come up with a plan!

[msg MSG_001 [Yosuke]]
Ooh, that sounds like something a[n]phantom thief would say. He looks so[n]into it too...

[msg MSG_002 [Yukiko]]
Is this where he really shines?

[msg MSG_003 [Ryuji]]
Well, Mona usually plans things out,[n]then the team follows his lead.

[msg MSG_004 [Ann]]
Didn't you just recently get into a huge[n]fight with him?

[msg MSG_005 [Ryuji]]
Uh, well... I had a lot to think about!

[msg MSG_006 [Kanji]]
...Somethin' happen between 'em?

[sel SEL_007 top]
Difference of opinion.
A lot.
You should apologize to Mona.
They were both at fault.

[msg MSG_008 [Ryuji]]
Huh... Y'know, somethin' feels kinda off[n]when you word it nicely like that.
I dunno... I wasn't thinkin' all that[n]straight at the time...

[msg MSG_009 [Ryuji]]
Yeah...
I really gotta learn to stop flyin' off[n]the handle so easily...

[msg MSG_010 [Ryuji]]
Aagh... C'mon, I said I was sorry.
Matter of fact, you were there, Joker![n]You saw me apologize!

[msg MSG_011 [Ryuji]]
Nah. The whole thing fell apart 'cause I[n]flew off the handle...

[msg MSG_012 [Ann]]
...Come to think of it, it was kind of[n]our fault too.
We thought it was just another ordinary[n]fight, so we didn't do anything to stop[n]it.

[msg MSG_013 [Naoto]]
...Well, it turned out all right, yes?[n]There will always be times when you[n]disagree.
However, it's through overcoming those[n]conflicts that you learn to truly trust[n]one another.

[msg MSG_014 [Haru]]
Yeah, slowly but surely you'll come to[n]understand each other.

[msg MSG_015 [Makoto]]
*chuckle* This became a rather serious[n]discussion, didn't it?
We'll keep working together as a team,[n]but we have to find our target first...

[msg MSG_016 [Yukiko]]
Let's see... We need to find where[n]they're hiding those crowns.

[msg MSG_017 [Morgana]]
Where would a Seidoptera hide its[n]treasure...? Any ideas, Joker?

[sel SEL_018 top]
Near its territory.
In a Treasure Spot.

[msg MSG_019 [Naoto]]
Good point. I imagine it would hide its[n]treasure somewhere it can keep under[n]close watch.

[msg MSG_020 [Naoto]]
Ah, so it conceals it within a Treasure[n]Spot then protects the surrounding[n]area... It's certainly possible.

[msg MSG_021 [Futaba]]
All right, sounds like finding a[n]Seidoptera first is our best bet.
Seidopteras are FOEs, so you should be[n]able to see them on your map.

[msg MSG_022 [Rise]]
There's two of them. So I'm guessing[n]each one has a treasure?

[msg MSG_023 [Ryuji]]
Well, we'll know once we get there.
All right, let's go scope out those[n]Seidopteras!

[msg MSG_024 [Chie]]
Yeah! Let's get a move on!
