[msg MSG_000 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Uhm, so we just have to defeat the[n]targets at the locations Elizabeth[n]specified, right?

[msg MSG_001 [Akihiko]]
That's all we need to do? That'll be[n]easy.

[msg MSG_002 [Mitsuru]]
Just remember, these Shadows aren't[n]weak. Don't hesitate to run if things[n]get out of hand.
Especially you, Akihiko. You get heated[n]far too easily. Set a good example for[n]the underclassmen.

[msg MSG_003 [Akihiko]]
I know. Give me some credit.

[msg MSG_004 [Shinjiro]]
Hah, do you now...?

[msg MSG_005 [Akihiko]]
What, you don't believe me, Shinji?

[msg MSG_006 [Shinjiro]]
Try being the one who has to rein you in[n]every time you run off on your own.

[msg MSG_007 [Akihiko]]
Wha―Well, what about you, Shinji!?[n]You've been talking down to us for who[n]knows how long...!

[msg MSG_008 [Mitsuru]]
*sigh* This again... They'll be a[n]moment.

[sel SEL_009 top]
Please say something, Mitsuru.
Help, [f 6 1 27 0 0 0].
Let's leave them be.

[msg MSG_010 [Mitsuru]]
Even if I were to intervene, they'd just[n]keep going.
Perhaps it's because they've known each[n]other since they were kids. I swear,[n]they're so immature...

[msg MSG_011 [Mitsuru]]
I don't think [f 6 1 26 0 0 0] could help if she[n]tried.
It's these two we're talking about.[n]It'll just start up again.

[msg MSG_012 [Mitsuru]]
It'll never end. You don't intend to[n]wait it out, do you?

[msg MSG_013 [P3 Fem Protag]]
It's okay, I have an idea! Just leave it[n]to me!

[msg MSG_014 [Mitsuru]]
What do you plan to do,?

[msg MSG_015 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Shinjiro-senpai! Akihiko-senpai! Listen[n]up!
This is a hunting mission, so why don't[n]we have a competition to see which one[n]of you is the better fighter?

[msg MSG_016 [Akihiko]]
A competition, huh?

[msg MSG_017 [P3 Fem Protag]]
That's right. But you can't just defeat[n]the enemies.
We're in this together, so flying solo's[n]off limits.
This will be about observing your[n]teammates and doing your best to support[n]them.
We'll decide the winner based on their[n]overall performance. Deal?

[msg MSG_018 [Akihiko]]
Heh... Interesting. I accept.
If I win, then you have to train with[n]me, Shinji.

[msg MSG_019 [Shinjiro]]
Wha―!? Why the hell would I have to do[n]that?

[msg MSG_020 [Akihiko]]
What, you're not afraid of losing, are[n]you?

[msg MSG_021 [Shinjiro]]
You little... There's no way I'd lose to[n]you, Aki.

[msg MSG_022 [Akihiko]]
All right, it's a duel, Shinji!

[msg MSG_023 [Shinjiro]]
Hah, don't come crying to me later.
So where're these enemies? I'm ready for[n]'em.

[msg MSG_024 [Akihiko]]
Trying to go at it alone...? That's[n]against the rules. Minus one point!

[msg MSG_025 [Shinjiro]]
What!? That doesn't count. We haven't[n]even started yet.

[msg MSG_026 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Working together is key, okay? Good[n]luck, you guys!

[msg MSG_027 [Mitsuru]]
To think you'd be able to tame those[n]two... Not bad, [f 6 1 26 0 0 0].

[msg MSG_028 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Ahaha, I'm used to it. The ones I know[n]are just like that!

[msg MSG_029 [Mitsuru]]
*sigh* They're like that over there too?[n]It's already giving me a headache...
Either way, thanks to we can finally[n]move forward. Let's get going.
