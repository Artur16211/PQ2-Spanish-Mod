A macho enemy and a thrilling brawl!
It was a rather sweaty―excuse me―heated[n]screening, and it left me very[n]satisfied.

[sel SEL_001 top]
Glad to hear it.
It was tough.

[msg MSG_002 [Elizabeth]]
Yes, the surprising battle near the[n]climax... My eyes were glued to the[n]screen until the very end.
And it looks like a new bond was formed[n]between the two "men."

[msg MSG_003 [Ryuji]]
...And that's when we beat the[n]ever-lovin' crap outta the Shadow!
Whaddya think? It's a special attack I[n]just thought up!

[msg MSG_004 [Kanji]]
Yeeeah! That's perfect! Friggin'[n]AMAZING!
So, first I'll go, "Raaah," and then...?

[msg MSG_005 [Ryuji]]
Here, I wrote it down. We can practice[n]it later!

[msg MSG_006 [Kanji]]
Why don't we give it a name? Something[n]super "manly"!

[msg MSG_007 [Ryuji]]
Good thinkin'! What about...

[msg MSG_008 [Morgana]]
Looks like you two are getting along[n]just fine now.

[msg MSG_009 [Kanji]]
......!
Y-Yeah...
......
......

[msg MSG_010 [Morgana]]
Wh-Why're you so quiet all of a sudden?

[msg MSG_011 [Ryuji]]
You've been staring at Morgana a lot[n]lately.
I thought it was 'cause you were tryna[n]pick a fight.

[msg MSG_012 [Kanji]]
Uh―No, it's not 'cause I don't like[n]him...

[msg MSG_013 [Ryuji]]
I mean, yeah, a talkin' cat's pretty[n]weird. But this one... He ain't that[n]bad.

[msg MSG_014 [Morgana]]
Stop calling me a cat!

[msg MSG_015 [Kanji]]
Well, yeah I was looking at him, but[n]it's just 'cause...

[msg MSG_016 [Ryuji]]
Because what...?

[msg MSG_017 [Kanji]]
...te.

[msg MSG_018 [Ryuji]]
...Hm?

[msg MSG_019 [Kanji]]
C...u...

[msg MSG_020 [Ryuji]]
What!? Just say it!

[msg MSG_021 [Kanji]]
Aarrgh! Just look how cute he is!
How can I not be interested in somethin'[n]that adorable!?
I wanna see how fluffy he is... How his[n]paws feel...
I'm all about that shit, damn it!
*gasp*

[msg MSG_022 [Ryuji]]
Ohh... So that's what it was.
Why didn't you just say so? Have at him.

[msg MSG_023 [Kanji]]
Seriously?

[msg MSG_024 [Morgana]]
Wha―? Ryuji! You can't just―

[sel SEL_025 top]
Go ahead.
Be gentle.
I recommend his paws.

[msg MSG_026 [Morgana]]
You too!?

[msg MSG_027 [Kanji]]
O-Okay, here I go...
H-Hold still, Mona... I'll be nice...

[msg MSG_028 [Morgana]]
Eeeeek!

[msg MSG_029 [Kanji]]
Get back here, Mona! Lemme feel how[n]fluffy your chin is!

[msg MSG_030 [Morgana]]
What kind of thief stops when someone[n]tells them to!?
Aaaahhh...!
