Heads up, guys! We've got two FOEs[n]nearby!

[msg MSG_001 [Shinjiro]]
Tch, they here 'cause of the security[n]change?

[msg MSG_002 [Futaba]]
Looks like we got a little more[n]investigating to do.
We'll have to beat those FOEs if we[n]wanna get through here. That or find[n]another way around.
Whether we take down the FOEs or search[n]for an alternate route is up to you,[n]Joker!
