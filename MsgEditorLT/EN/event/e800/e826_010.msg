This next special screening promises to[n]be a rather action-packed adventure...
It's a treasure hunt. Your task will be[n]to locate the hidden treasure deep[n]within the jungle!

[sel SEL_001 top]
What else is new?
That's our thing.
Hidden treasure?

[msg MSG_002 [Morgana]]
Yeah. Finding treasure is the Phantom[n]Thieves' specialty.
So what kind of treasure is it?

[msg MSG_003 [Elizabeth]]
It seems to be some sort of prized[n]artifact a researcher intended to offer[n]to his lover...
Hoping to do so once his research was[n]complete, he hid it for safekeeping.

[msg MSG_004 [Rise]]
...What happened to the researcherâ€•

[msg MSG_005 [Elizabeth]]
Here is a map of the treasure's[n]location... Oh? There appears to be[n]something scribbled on the back...
"Once this job is over, I'll finally[n]propose to her."
"This work is the sheer embodiment of[n]both beauty and allure. She's sure to[n]love it..."

[msg MSG_006 [Futaba]]
Guess he tempted fate...

[msg MSG_007 [Ann]]
So it was a present to his[n]girlfriend...? I'm kinda curious about[n]what it was.

[msg MSG_008 [Yukari]]
He said it was the embodiment of beauty.[n]Maybe it's some kind of jewel?

[msg MSG_009 [Rise]]
Wow, that's so romantic!

[msg MSG_010 [Junpei]]
The girls sure are excited about this...

[msg MSG_011 [Teddie]]
Ooh! This is it!

[msg MSG_012 [Yosuke]]
Huh!? What're you goin' on about!?

[msg MSG_013 [Teddie]]
Whoever finds the treasure first will be[n]crowned the number-one mascot!

[sel SEL_014 top]
Number-one mascot?
Why?

[msg MSG_015 [Teddie]]
A mascot's duty is to make the ladies[n]happy and provide comfort whenever they[n]need it...
Naturally, if finding the treasure makes[n]everyone happy, then it's only fair that[n]the one who finds it gets the title!

[msg MSG_016 [Koromaru]]
Woof...

[msg MSG_017 [Aigis]]
Koromaru-san says he has no idea what[n]you're talking about.

[msg MSG_018 [Morgana]]
You said it. No one cares about your[n]silly little contest...

[msg MSG_019 [Teddie]]
Oho...? Well, if there's no competition,[n]then I guess I win by default.
And then I get pretty Ann-chan all to[n]myself...

[msg MSG_020 [Morgana]]
Arrrgh! Where do you get off!?

[msg MSG_021 [Teddie]]
If you don't like it, just try and take[n]the title from me!

[msg MSG_022 [Morgana]]
Dammit... Fine, I'll do it! But let's[n]get one thing straight...
I don't care about your stupid title![n]I'm only doing this to make Lady Ann[n]happy!

[msg MSG_023 [Yukari]]
It's getting pretty heated over there.[n]Are they okay?

[sel SEL_024 top]
They're fine.
It's actually convenient.
Morgana's gonna win.

[msg MSG_025 [Futaba]]
Well, it is a treasure hunt. It's good[n]for everyone to be motivated.

[msg MSG_026 [Morgana]]
...
Right. There's no way I'm losing to some[n]pervy bear!

[msg MSG_027 [Haru]]
What about you, Koro-chan?

[msg MSG_028 [Koromaru]]
Arf! Arf, arf!

[msg MSG_029 [Aigis]]
"The contest is of little interest to[n]me, but I'll gladly help look for the[n]treasure..."
...So says Koromaru-san.

[msg MSG_030 [Teddie]]
Then, that settles it! Let the[n]first-ever Mascot Match-up begin!
May the manliest of all men, come on[n]down!

[msg MSG_031 [Morgana]]
Yeah!

[msg MSG_032 [Koromaru]]
Arf!
