Mission accomplished. Come on back,[n]everyone.

[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
All right! Let's roll, Ken.

[msg MSG_002 [Ken]]
Um, would it be all right if I asked one[n]more thing?

[msg MSG_003 [Morgana]]
Hm? What is it?

[msg MSG_004 [Ken]]
Can you change anyone's heart, no matter[n]who they are?

[sel SEL_005 top]
If they're evil...
If they're on the navigator.

[msg MSG_006 [Morgana]]
Yeah. If there's evil in someone's[n]heart, we should be able to find them on[n]the Metaverse Navigator.
Why do you ask?

[msg MSG_007 [Ken]]
Navigator? You mean Oracle?

[msg MSG_008 [Morgana]]
No, the Metaverse Navigator. It usually[n]only reacts to criminals.
Why do you ask?

[msg MSG_009 [Ken]]
Oh, no reason. I was just a little[n]curious.
Well, we've finished up here, so let's[n]head back!

[msg MSG_010 [Ryuji]]
