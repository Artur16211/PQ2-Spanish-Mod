This special screening this time is a[n]bit fanciful, a bit ethereal, like a[n]fairy tale...
I'd like for you to find a butterfly in[n]Hikari's movie, and bring it here.

[sel SEL_001 top]
Sounds easy.
I don't like bugs...

[msg MSG_002 [Hikari]]
Now that I think about it, there were a[n]lot in my movie. They were all so[n]beautiful...

[msg MSG_003 [Chie]]
S-Same here... But I think I can handle[n]butterflies.

[msg MSG_004 [Yukari]]
So we have to go catch a butterfly? A[n]specific one, or any of them?

[msg MSG_005 [Elizabeth]]
If we're going through the trouble[n]anyway, I'd prefer you catch a real[n]lunker.

[msg MSG_006 [Futaba]]
Can butterflies be "lunkers"? Isn't that[n]a fish thing?
I better not see you trying to eat one,[n]Inari. I don't care how much protein[n]they have!

[msg MSG_007 [Yusuke]]
Insects? Even I have my limits.
Though... Perhaps if there was no other[n]choice...

[msg MSG_008 [Naoto]]
I-Is it too late to raise objections?

[msg MSG_009 [Akihiko]]
Interesting. You said they're full of[n]protein?

[msg MSG_010 [Yukari]]
How about you stop right there.

[msg MSG_011 [Haru]]
*giggle* It sounds almost like a picnic,[n]doesn't it? Surrounded by flowers,[n]looking for butterflies...

[msg MSG_012 [Morgana]]
With all those Shadows around, we can't[n]let our guards down... but I guess we[n]can relax a little.
Okay... Once we're ready, let's go.
