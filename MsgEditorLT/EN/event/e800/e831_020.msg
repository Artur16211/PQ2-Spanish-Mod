[msg MSG_000 [Ryuji]]
A nightclub, huh...? Any idea where[n]we're supposed to look?

[msg MSG_001 [Yusuke]]
I'm not too familiar with such places[n]myself.
From the conversation from earlier, it[n]sounds like [f 6 1 16 0 0]-san's an expert...

[msg MSG_002 [P3 Hero]]
I'm no expert... I just go every now and[n]then.

[msg MSG_003 [Shinjiro]]
Club Escapade at Paulownia Mall...?

[msg MSG_004 [Kanji]]
Oh! I know that place! We went there[n]during our school trip!

[msg MSG_005 [Teddie]]
Yeah, we had a reeeeeeal good time!

[msg MSG_006 [Yosuke]]
I feel like you guys were just drunk off[n]the atmosphere...
So is that where you and your pals like[n]to hang out, [f 6 1 15 0 0 0]?

[msg MSG_007 [P3 Hero]]
No, I usually go by myself.

[msg MSG_008 [Kanji]]
W-Whoa... You're like an adult...
What the hell you even do at clubs and[n]bars if you go by yourself?

[sel SEL_009 top]
Talk to the adults.
Work.
Listen to drunks complain.

[msg MSG_010 [P3 Hero]]
Yeah. You meet all sorts of interesting[n]people you probably wouldn't otherwise.
Like a monk...

[msg MSG_011 [P3 Hero]]
Work, huh...? It's tough keeping up with[n]all the orders, isn't it?
There was always this monk asking me to[n]bring him drinks...

[msg MSG_012 [P3 Hero]]
You get to hear things you normally[n]wouldn't.
Like a monk preaching, for example...

[msg MSG_013 [Junpei]]
A monk!? You met a monk at a nightclub!?

[msg MSG_014 [Ken]]
-san never fails to surprise us...

[msg MSG_015 [Ryuji]]
I guess that's just how it goes with[n]these guys...

[sel SEL_016 top]
These guys?
What're you talking about?

[msg MSG_017 [Ryuji]]
You're always making friends with[n]people! Like that doctor lady and the[n]shogi girl!

[msg MSG_018 [Teddie]]
Say what!? Tell me more! Please! I gotta[n]know!

[msg MSG_019 [P3 Hero]]
Look, this is fun and all, but can we[n]get going?
Nightclubs are usually located in the[n]far corners of a city or deep within.

[msg MSG_020 [Akihiko]]
's right. Let's go.
