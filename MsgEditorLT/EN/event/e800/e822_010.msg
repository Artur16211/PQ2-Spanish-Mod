This next special screening takes the[n]form of a pulse-pounding action film.
Your destination will be A.I.G.I.S.
And your task will be to take down three[n]Guardian Machines.

[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
They're those big ones, yeah...? We[n]better step up our game, then.

[msg MSG_002 [Morgana]]
Yeah. There's no room for mistakes when[n]you're part of the Phantom Thieves!

[msg MSG_003 [Ken]]
Um, wait!

[msg MSG_004 [Ryuji]]
Hm?

[msg MSG_005 [Ken]]
If you don't mind, do you think you[n]could teach me more about the Phantom[n]Thieves during this screening?

[sel SEL_006 top]
Why?
You looking to join?

[msg MSG_007 [Ryuji]]
Oh, you wanna be like us?

[msg MSG_008 [Morgana]]
A phantom thief hopeful, huh...? Well,[n]you've certainly got potential.
We'll just have to see how you keep up[n]with my strict leadership...

[msg MSG_009 [Ken]]
I-I don't exactly want to join...! I'd[n]rather just watch and learn!

[msg MSG_010 [Morgana]]
Mmm, a desire to learn is a wonderful[n]thing.

[msg MSG_011 [Ryuji]]
Then, how about we teach you the code of[n]the Phantom Thievesâ€•right here, right[n]now?

[sel SEL_012 top]
Who made you the leader?
Code?
We'll call you Kid Phantom!

[msg MSG_013 [Ann]]
Yeah. Don't you think you're getting a[n]little carried away...?
You don't have to say yes if you don't[n]want to, Ken-kun.

[msg MSG_014 [Ken]]
I-It's okay.
I do want to know more about the Phantom[n]Thieves, though, so I'd be happy if you[n]agreed to teach me.

[msg MSG_015 [Ryuji]]
It's like, uh... Well... You know what I[n]mean, right, Morgana?

[msg MSG_016 [Morgana]]
Huh? O-Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

[msg MSG_017 [Ann]]
Sorry about those two, Ken-kun... You[n]don't have to say yes if you don't want[n]to.

[msg MSG_018 [Ken]]
No, it's okay. It's better to learn by[n]experience anyway. I can handle it.

[msg MSG_019 [Ken]]
Hey, stop treating me like a kid!

[msg MSG_020 [Ann]]
Yeah, stop bugging him. He doesn't have[n]to join if he doesn't want to...

[msg MSG_021 [Ken]]
Oh... Well, I wouldn't mind watching you[n]guys for a bit.

[msg MSG_022 [Elizabeth]]
Well, well, well... This is shaping up[n]to be a most eventful screening.
Now then, I wish all of you the best of[n]luck.
