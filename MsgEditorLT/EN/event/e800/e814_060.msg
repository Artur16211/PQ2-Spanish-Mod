[msg MSG_000 [Yukiko]]
We're back with some herbs. Hang on just[n]little bit longer, okay?

[msg MSG_001 [Young herbivore]]
*whimper*

[msg MSG_002]
We ground the herbs and treated the[n]young dinosaur...

[msg MSG_003 [Haru]]
There we go. He should feel better soon.

[msg MSG_004 [Young herbivore]]
Kyu!

[msg MSG_005 [Yukiko]]
Hehe, looks like you're all better now.[n]Way to hang in there, Kyubei.

[msg MSG_006 [Young herbivore]]
Kyu, kyu, kyu!

[msg MSG_007 [Chie]]
When did you name him!?

[msg MSG_008 [P4 Hero]]
I still don't see his mother though.
We could ask Margaret to look after him,[n]but...

[sel SEL_009 top]
Let's keep looking.
Let's pull back for now.

[msg MSG_010 [Haru]]
Right, we can't just leave him here.

[msg MSG_011 [Haru]]
I don't want to leave him here. I say we[n]look around a little more.

[msg MSG_012 [Futaba]]
Hey, wait a sec! That voice...

[msg MSG_013 [Naoto]]
It's faint, but I hear it as well. Could[n]it be...

[msg MSG_014 [Young herbivore]]
Kyuuu!

[msg MSG_015 [Mother herbivore]]
Rrrr!

[msg MSG_016 [Makoto]]
That must be his mother... I'm glad they[n]found each other.

[msg MSG_017 [Yukiko]]
They look so happy.

[msg MSG_018 [Haru]]
Mhm, Kyu-chan seems much better now. It[n]looks like all he really wanted was to[n]be near his mother.

[msg MSG_019 [Yukiko]]
......
In reality, I guess every parent worries[n]about their child...

[msg MSG_020 [Haru]]
Yukiko-chan?

[msg MSG_021 [Yukiko]]
Oh, um... I'm sorry.
I just got this strange feeling watching[n]them...

[msg MSG_022 [Haru]]
Strange feeling?

[msg MSG_023 [Yukiko]]
When I was little, I never had a hard[n]time being honest about my feelings.
I didn't worry about anything, and I was[n]able to have fun everyday.
But, one day, things got complicated[n]between my family and...
I wasn't able to be honest with my[n]feelings anymore―like how Kyubei's being[n]right now...

[msg MSG_024 [Haru]]
Oh... You know, Yukiko-chan, I'm just[n]like you.

[msg MSG_025 [Yukiko]]
You too, Noir? I had no idea...

[msg MSG_026 [Haru]]
But I noticed something.
Perhaps tying me down was their way of[n]showing that they loved me.

[msg MSG_027 [Yukiko]]
You really think so?
But... I still want to make my own[n]decisions.

[msg MSG_028 [Haru]]
Of course. I think that's great. You[n]shouldn't have to lie to yourself and[n]give in to what everyone says.
Even if you think differently than them,[n]I'm sure they'd be happy to see you[n]follow what you believe in.

[msg MSG_029 [Yukiko]]
Yeah... You're right.

[msg MSG_030 [Young herbivore]]
Kyu!

[msg MSG_031 [Yukiko]]
Hm? What is it, Kyubei?

[msg MSG_032 [Haru]]
It looks like he's carrying something.

[msg MSG_033 [Yukiko]]
A stone? It's beautiful...

[msg MSG_034 [Chie]]
Maybe it's to say thanks for all the[n]help?

[msg MSG_035 [Yukiko]]
Oh... Thank you, Kyubei.

[msg MSG_036 [Young herbivore]]
Kyu, kyu!

[msg MSG_037 [Haru]]
Don't get lost anymore, all right? Take[n]good care of yourself, Kyu-chan!

[msg MSG_038 [Young herbivore]]
Kyu!

[msg MSG_039 [Chie]]
Wow, they actually understand him! Those[n]two are amazing...

[msg MSG_040 [Morgana]]
Guess that's it for now. Let's head[n]back.
