So this is the singing flower...

[msg MSG_001 [Singing flower]]
My wings are plucked. I yearn for the[n]sky... I know what I am, a tragic[n]effigy...

[msg MSG_002 [Kanji]]
Huh? What the hell's this guy sayin'?

[msg MSG_003 [Marie]]
Wow... I can feel so much of its pathos!
My wings are plucked. I yearn for the[n]sky... Yes, I am an angel, fallen in[n]love!

[msg MSG_004 [Morgana]]
I don't get it... Is poetry supposed to[n]make you feel itchy?

[msg MSG_005 [Marie]]
An angel... that is both fallen from[n]Heaven, and fallen in love... But[n]there's something missing!
These words need an aura of solitude,[n]like they're shouldering a sin too[n]shameful for the world to see...!

[sel SEL_006 top]
Only.
Lonely.
Single.

[msg MSG_007 [Marie]]
That's not bad, I guess... Only, only...
Oh! Lonely! Lonely Lucifer!

[msg MSG_008 [Marie]]
*gasp* That's it! That's great!
Lonely Lucifer!

[msg MSG_009 [Marie]]
That's sort of the idea, but I need[n]something more sad... Oh!
Lonely! Lonely Lucifer!

[msg MSG_010 [Futaba]]
Damn, she writes fast. Of course, our[n]team has someone like that, too...

[msg MSG_011 [P4 Hero]]
Who are you talking about? Anyway, this[n]is pretty normal for Marie.
How's it going, Marie? You have enough[n]to go on, now?

[msg MSG_012 [Marie]]
Yes, for the loneliest of the angels is[n]corrupted by the seven deadly sins and[n]doomed to burn in the hellfires of love!
Argh, the pathos! So strong, but not[n]quite enough. And when I'm so close!

[msg MSG_013 [Singing flower]]
What you seek lies deep below...

[msg MSG_014 [Marie]]
Huh?

[msg MSG_015 [Akechi]]
Is it saying we should go to the floor[n]below?
I think I saw a similar flower down[n]there.

[sel SEL_016 top]
Wow, good memory.
You speak flower?

[msg MSG_017 [Akechi]]
It's a result of my detective work.

[msg MSG_018 [Marie]]
Ahh, so you aren't just sparkly for[n]show.

[msg MSG_019 [Marie]]
The language of beautiful blossoms? So[n]you have pathos as well. Didn't expect[n]that from someone so sparkly...
*gasp* Could it be that the sparkliness[n]is just there to hide the darkness[n]inside of you...?

[msg MSG_020 [Akechi]]
Haha. I'm, uh, not sure I understand[n]what you're saying.

[msg MSG_021 [P4 Hero]]
Break it up, break it up. We need to[n]head to a lower floor and search for[n]more singing flowers.

[msg MSG_022 [Marie]]
You don't mind keeping up the search for[n]pathos?

[msg MSG_023 [P4 Hero]]
We'll keep going until you're satisfied.

[msg MSG_024 [Teddie]]
To the other floor, to get some more. So[n]that Marie won't be a bore! What do you[n]think of that verse, Emmy-chan?

[msg MSG_025 [Marie]]
Um...
