Ohh. There's the terminal.
Gimme just a sec. Let's see if I can get[n]what we need.

[msg MSG_001 [Naoto]]
Very well. I suppose we can take a[n]break, then.

[msg MSG_002 [Futaba]]
Done.

[msg MSG_003 [Naoto]]
Huh!? Already?

[msg MSG_004 [Futaba]]
Hehehe. Piece of cake. All I did was[n]take a look.

[msg MSG_005 [Futaba]]
Joker, I'm gonna tell you where the cars[n]are at. Mark them on your map.

[msg MSG_006]
The locations of the police cars have[n]been added to the map.

[msg MSG_007 [Naoto]]
This'll make things a little easier.
The officers should be at their cars.[n]Let's be on our way.

[msg MSG_008 [Futaba]]
Looks like we don't need this anymore.[n]We already know where the cars are.
