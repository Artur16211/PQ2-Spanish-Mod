All right, here we are! A regular[n]fisherman's paradise!

[msg MSG_001 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Oh, there! I just saw one. It was huge!

[msg MSG_002 [Ryuji]]
Yo, there's another one! There's a crap[n]ton of 'em!

[msg MSG_003 [Yosuke]]
Y'know, now that I think about it, how[n]the heck are we gonna catch 'em?
We don't have a fishing pole... We gonna[n]have to use our hands?

[msg MSG_004 [Akihiko]]
Or, better yet, our fists.
We'll stop 'em with a right jab then[n]snatch 'em with an uppercut!
It'll be a walk in the park compared to[n]fighting Shadows.

[msg MSG_005 [Yosuke]]
Whoa, whoa! No way!
It's way better to use a fishing rod or[n]a spear or something...

[msg MSG_006 [Chie]]
Huh? What's that sound?

[msg MSG_007 [Rise]]
Careful, guys! An FOE's closing in fast!

[msg MSG_008 [Chie]]
H-Hey! Do something before we're[n]dinosaur food!

[msg MSG_009 [Fuuka]]
There must have been a nest nearby! It's[n]coming this way!

[msg MSG_010 [Ann]]
Wh-What do we do? Do we run for it!?

[msg MSG_011 [Yusuke]]
......
Haaaaaah!

[msg MSG_012 [Yusuke]]
That's it! I will tolerate this hunger[n]no longer!
Anything that dares stand between me and[n]my food will answer to my blade!

[msg MSG_013 [Futaba]]
Ohhh, crap. Fox is pissed.

[msg MSG_014 [Akihiko]]
I'm with Fox on that. There's no way[n]we're backing down now.

[msg MSG_015 [Shinjiro]]
Hang on a sec. If we fight here, we'll[n]scare off all the fish.
We can either move somewhere else or[n]fight them here... It's your call,[n]Joker.

[sel SEL_016 top]
Let's get away from here.
Let's fight somewhere nearby.

[msg MSG_017 [Futaba]]
Roger that! Be sure to lead it away from[n]here!
Keep a safe distance, go somewhere safe,[n]and bring it down!

[msg MSG_018 [Futaba]]
You're gonna fight it just like that,[n]huh? I feel like it'll be better if you[n]guys move further away, but...
I'm sure if you guys keep your distance,[n]we'll be able to shoo it out of here!

[msg MSG_019 [Gaudy carnivore]]
ROOOAAARRR!

[msg MSG_020 [Futaba]]
Here it comes! Let 'im have it, guys!
