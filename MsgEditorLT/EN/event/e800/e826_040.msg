This path is a bit of a detour, but[n]it'll definitely take us to the[n]treasure.

[msg MSG_001 [Koromaru]]
Arf, arf!

[msg MSG_002 [Ann]]
Koro-chan!? What is it?

[msg MSG_003 [Aigis]]
He seems to be saying, "I smell[n]treasure. Follow me."

[msg MSG_004 [Chie]]
Treasure? Hmm... It definitely doesn't[n]smell like meat...

[msg MSG_005 [Yosuke]]
Why are you so sure the treasure is[n]meat? Where's the beauty and/or allure[n]in that?

[msg MSG_006 [Yusuke]]
Mmm, rich ruby flesh complimented by[n]snow-white lines of fat... I would argue[n]that meat has a beauty all its own!

[msg MSG_007 [Teddie]]
Hmph, that won't please the ladies!
You think you've got it all figured out,[n]huh? Well, you're no match for this[n]bear's nose...
*sniff sniff* *sniff sniff* Hrmmm!?

[sel SEL_008 top]
Don't tell me...
Treasure?

[msg MSG_009 [Teddie]]
This tantalizing sensation tickling my[n]Teddie senses... It has to be treasure!
And I'm not talkin' a measly one or two[n]pieces. I'm talkin' a whole trove!

[msg MSG_010 [Ryuji]]
Hey, looks like those two are about to[n]show you up. You gonna be all right?
...Mona? Hey...

[msg MSG_011 [Morgana]]
Mrrroooow... Treasuuure...

[msg MSG_012 [Ryuji]]
Not you too!

[msg MSG_013 [Yusuke]]
Treasure is essentially his catnip.

[msg MSG_014 [Ann]]
Well, it's not the same as the Treasure[n]in a Palace, but I guess he got kinda[n]triggered by Teddie and Koro-chan...

[msg MSG_015 [Futaba]]
This path is longer, but it looks like[n]there's treasure along the way.
Whaddya thinkin', Joker?

[sel SEL_016 top]
We keep going this way.
I'll trust my instincts.
The short path is better.

[msg MSG_017 [Ryuji]]
Yeah, we can't turn back now that we[n]know there's treasure.

[msg MSG_018 [Ann]]
Then, let's go get it!

[msg MSG_019 [Ryuji]]
Hell yeah! We wouldn't be phantom[n]thieves if we passed up treasure sittin'[n]right in front of us!

[msg MSG_020 [Ann]]
Yeah! That treasure is ours!

[msg MSG_021 [Ryuji]]
Whaâ€•? We're not gonna go get the[n]treasure?
Oh well, you're the boss.

[msg MSG_022 [Ann]]
Then, do you want to turn back?
