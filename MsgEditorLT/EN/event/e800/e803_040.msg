Hah! Two down! Gonna need to do a lot[n]better than that if you wanna beat us!

[msg MSG_001 [Makoto]]
Hmhm, he's got a lot of spirit. It's[n]almost like having another Skull on the[n]team.

[msg MSG_002 [Ryuji]]
Hey, I'm nothin' like him... I ain't[n]some thug.

[sel SEL_003 top]
He's actually the serious type.
A delinquent, then?

[msg MSG_004 [Ryuji]]
Whaâ€•? I ain't serious!

[msg MSG_005 [Makoto]]
He may not look it, but it's true...

[msg MSG_006 [Ryuji]]
Who you callin' a delinquent!?

[msg MSG_007 [Makoto]]
Well, he is pretty violent, I can see[n]how people would misjudge him.

[msg MSG_008 [Makoto]]
He really does care about his friends.[n]He just gets angered a little too[n]easily.

[msg MSG_009 [Ryuji]]
Sh-Shut up! Let's just get this crap[n]over with!

[msg MSG_010 [Rise]]
Haha, aw, are you embarrassed?
It looks like you two have more in[n]common than we thought. Right, Kanji?

[msg MSG_011 [Kanji]]
......
I ain't nothin' like him.

[msg MSG_012 [Kanji]]
Let's just drop it and keep movin'. Lead[n]the way, Joker.
I'll floor the next one in no time! Just[n]watch!

[msg MSG_013 [Ryuji]]
Huh? Like hell you will! That's my job!

[msg MSG_014 [Futaba]]
C'mon, guys! Quit wasting time! At this[n]rate, the Shadow's gonna catch a cold[n]out here in his skivvies!
Either way, this one'll be the last of[n]'em! Check the map and get going!
