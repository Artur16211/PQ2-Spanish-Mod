[msg MSG_000 [Elizabeth]]
Well, it seems everyone is here. Let us[n]immediately move to the topic at hand.

[msg MSG_000_1 [Elizabeth]]
The film you've acquired is connected to[n]the myriad possibilities of the wild[n]card's power.
Details on its usage are unknown, but[n]while it seems dark and obscured upon[n]first discovery...
With an appropriate display of power,[n]you can restore its lost brilliance.

[msg MSG_001 [Sonorous voice]]
And such a display is best achieved by[n]battling one who rules over power[n]itself. Namely, us...
*chuckle* How intriguing.

[msg MSG_002 [P4 Hero]]
Margaret!?

[msg MSG_003 [Margaret]]
Good day to you all.
Elizabeth has already filled me in. I[n]would be more than happy to lend my[n]assistance as well.

[sel SEL_004 top]
Assistance...?
So you're next?

[msg MSG_005 [Margaret]]
Indeed so. Your next bout will be[n]against me.

[msg MSG_005_1 [Margaret]]
You needn't worryâ€•as one who rules over[n]power myself, I'm sure I will prove a[n]worthy opponent.

[msg MSG_006 [Yosuke]]
Uh, it's not so much about the "worthy[n]opponent" thing. More like a "can we[n]survive this" thing...

[msg MSG_007 [Margaret]]
I can see you've all grown stronger[n]since your bout with Theo.

[msg MSG_007_1 [Margaret]]
Come at me as if you wish to kill. In[n]turn, I shall respond with all my might.

[msg MSG_008 [Teddie]]
So sexy, but oh so dangerous too! This[n]femme fatale's gonna be a powerful[n]foe...!

[msg MSG_009 [Margaret]]
I'm ready to do this whenever you wish.[n]Come speak to me when you're prepared.

[sel SEL_010 top]
We're ready to do this.
We need some time.

[msg MSG_011 [Margaret]]
*chuckle* Eager, are we? Well, please[n]come this way.

[msg MSG_012 [Margaret]]
Yes, understandable. Please come again[n]once you're ready.

[msg MSG_013 [Margaret]]
Are you sufficiently prepared?

[sel SEL_014 top]
We're good to go.
Not just yet.

[msg MSG_015 [Margaret]]
Very well. Then please, come this way.

[msg MSG_016 [Margaret]]
*chuckle* You needn't worry. I can be[n]patient.

[msg MSG_017 [Margaret]]
Were you calling me for another battle?

[sel SEL_018 top]
Yes, please.
Sorry, didn't mean to.

[msg MSG_019 [Margaret]]
Very well. Then please, come this way.

[msg MSG_020 [Margaret]]
My... Is that so?
Please come and ask for me if ever you[n]feel inclined.
