[msg MSG_000 [Teddie]]
Now, who needs encouraging? I'm ready to[n]cheer some people up with my girly[n]cuteness!

[msg MSG_001 [Rise]]
Teddie, that heavy breathing is really[n]creepy.
Try to calm down, okay? We're gonna need[n]you for this.

[msg MSG_002 [Haru]]
It's interesting... I wonder why we of[n]all people were chosen...

[msg MSG_003 [Aigis]]
According to Skull-san, you are known as[n]the Beauty Thief.
That seems to be the reason you were[n]chosen.

[msg MSG_004 [Haru]]
Um, well... that's just a name I use to[n]hide my real identity!

[msg MSG_005 [Teddie]]
Oooh! That's so stylish!

[msg MSG_006 [Aigis]]
If we consider the possibility that we[n]were all chosen for specific reasons...
Then, it makes sense that Rise-san was[n]chosen because of her work as an idol.
As for me, it is likely that I was[n]chosen through the process of[n]elimination.

[msg MSG_007 [Rise]]
Process of elimination?

[msg MSG_008 [Aigis]]
-san was likely removed as a candidate[n]because she comes from another world.
And according to the simulations I ran[n]for Mitsuru-san, Yukari-san, and[n]Fuuka-san...
There was a 99% probability that they[n]would have either refused to participate[n]or just left altogether.

[msg MSG_009 [Haru]]
But that isn't to say you're not[n]beautiful yourself, Aigis-san.

[msg MSG_010 [Teddie]]
That's right. Ai-chan, Rise-chan,[n]Noir... All of you are very, very[n]pretty!
But I shall surpass you, and then I will[n]become the Girl Talk King!
Hrm, hrm, hrm... I'll learn all the best[n]beauty secrets and become a beauty[n]myself!

[msg MSG_011 [Haru]]
*giggle* Good luck, Teddie.

[msg MSG_012 [Rise]]
Just don't forget that our mission is to[n]encourage the people here, okay?

[msg MSG_013 [Aigis]]
In that case, should we relocate to an[n]area where people are known to gather?

[msg MSG_014 [Haru]]
The best place for that would probably[n]be Kamoshida Square, wouldn't it?
Let's head over that way for now.
