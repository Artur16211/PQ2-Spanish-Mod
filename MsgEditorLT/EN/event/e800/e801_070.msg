[msg MSG_000 [Elizabeth]]
Well done. You managed to defeat all[n]eight Basalts.
My palms were sweating so intensely, I[n]nearly lost hold of both my popcorn and[n]my cola...
Watching Makoto and Haru steadfastly mow[n]down their enemies was truly[n]exhilarating.

[msg MSG_001 [Haru]]
Did we really mow them down...?

[msg MSG_002 [Ryuji]]
Well, with the way you two were kickin'[n]ass and takin' names, I believe it.

[msg MSG_003 [Morgana]]
Hey, Makoto. You said you had something[n]on your mind earlier. What was it?

[msg MSG_004 [Makoto]]
I wasn't going to say anything, but[n]since you already know this much...

[msg MSG_005 [Haru]]
...I'm sorry we didn't tell you sooner.[n]Now's probably a good time.

[msg MSG_006 [Makoto]]
You know how we got captured in the[n]Kamoshidaman movie?
We wanted to do something to make up for[n]all the trouble we caused you back[n]there.

[msg MSG_007 [Haru]]
Now that we're with everyone again, we[n]thought we'd try to help with the[n]special screening...
If we clear it, we'll get equipment that[n]will make us stronger, right?

[msg MSG_008 [Naoto]]
I see. So your eagerness stemmed from a[n]desire to help everyone.

[msg MSG_009 [Makoto]]
I guess that's it...
I wanted to keep it a secret, so... I'm[n]a little embarrassed now that it's all[n]out in the open.

[sel SEL_010 top]
Thank you.
You slipped up.

[msg MSG_011 [Haru]]
No, we're the ones who should be[n]thanking you.
If you hadn't come for us, we never[n]would have escaped.

[msg MSG_012 [Morgana]]
You have a point. Makoto may seem[n]perfect, but she can get careless every[n]now and then.

[msg MSG_013 [Makoto]]
Ngh... W-Well...
I guess it does happen on occasion...

[msg MSG_014 [Ann]]
Ahaha! But you're still super reliable!

[msg MSG_015 [Haru]]
Mako-chan and I simply wanted to show[n]our gratitude to everyone.
If you hadn't come for us, we never[n]would have escaped.

[msg MSG_016 [Ryuji]]
Well, you guys don't gotta get all[n]worked up about it.
I mean, we only managed to save you[n]'cause of that tip you gave us about the[n]statue.

[msg MSG_017 [Yusuke]]
Indeed. You helped us as well.
Besides, it's natural for friends to[n]help one another. There's no need to[n]repay us.

[msg MSG_018 [Futaba]]
Whoa... I'm proud of you, Inari. I[n]thought you'd want payment more than[n]anyone.

[msg MSG_019 [Yusuke]]
How rude...
I may not say no to free meals, but I'm[n]not that petty of an individual... I[n]think.

[msg MSG_020 [Ryuji]]
You think!?

[msg MSG_021 [Haru]]
Hm, hm... Thank you again, everyone.[n]We're glad to be here.

[msg MSG_022 [Makoto]]
And we don't just mean as part of the[n]Phantom Thieves.
That goes for [f 6 1 26 0 0 0]-san and the[n]Investigation Team too. We're in this[n]together.

[msg MSG_023 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Yeah! Count me in!

[msg MSG_024 [P4 Hero]]
Likewise, we're glad to be here too.

[msg MSG_025 [Elizabeth]]
Ahh, what a beautiful and happy ending![n]I'm so emotional, I'm on the verge of[n]tears.
Now then, here is your reward. Please[n]accept it.
Also, don't forget to visit Theo's shop[n]and sell the materials you've[n]gathered...
