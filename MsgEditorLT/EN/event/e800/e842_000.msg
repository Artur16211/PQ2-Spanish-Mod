So many movie theaters...
She's the one who made all these, right?

[msg MSG_001 [Naoto]]
She said it was something given physical[n]form? And mentioned the collective[n]unconscious, too...

[msg MSG_002 [Teddie]]
What's an unconscious? Is it kind of[n]like dreaming?

[msg MSG_003 [Morgana]]
Unconscious desires lie buried within[n]human hearts, totally separate from[n]their conscious mind.
A dream only shows you a flicker of that[n]unconscious will. It's like a message[n]from your own mind.
Well, that may be a little too deep for[n]amateurs...

[msg MSG_004 [Mitsuru]]
You're remarkably well-informed. Where[n]did you learn all this?

[msg MSG_005 [Morgana]]
It's common sense! When you're an expert[n]like me, it comes naturally!
...Wait, how DO I know this?

[msg MSG_006 [Ryuji]]
*sigh...* Sometimes I just don't know[n]about you, man.

[msg MSG_007]
A new special screening: "The Lost[n]Butterfly" has been added to the box[n]office.
