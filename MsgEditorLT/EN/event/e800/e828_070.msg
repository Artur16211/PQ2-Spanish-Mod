Well done, everyone.
This screening refused to remain as just[n]a riveting treasure hunt.
When the robot reawakened, it was as if[n]my feelings were, how should I put it,[n]"hit by a truck"â€•I burst into tears.
You have my deepest gratitude for taking[n]me through such a moving story.
Please accept this as your reward.

Arf!

[msg MSG_002 [Aigis]]
Koromaru-san says he enjoyed spending[n]time with you,-san.

[msg MSG_003 [Ken]]
That reminds me, Aigis-san... You said[n]both you and Koromaru sensed something[n]in [f 6 1 27 0 0 0]-san.
What exactly was it?

[msg MSG_004 [Koromaru]]
Arf...?

[msg MSG_005 [Aigis]]
I'm sorry. Neither of us were able to[n]come up with a clear answer.

[msg MSG_006 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Ahaha, weird.
Well, no sense worrying about it, right?[n]I mean, the fact that we're all here in[n]the first place is weird too!
I'm just glad to be here with everyone.[n]Is that okay? Or is that weird?

[msg MSG_007 [Aigis]]
-san...

[msg MSG_008 [Koromaru]]
Arf, arf!

[msg MSG_009 [Aigis]]
Koromaru-san says, too, it is best to[n]live in the present.
I must agree.

[msg MSG_010 [Ken]]
*chuckle* You're right. I think things[n]are just fine the way they are now!
We've still got a ways to go, but we'll[n]get through this if we work together.

[msg MSG_011 [Koromaru]]
Awooo!

[msg MSG_012 [Ken]]
Koromaru seems motivated too. Of course,[n]I don't plan on sitting around either.

[msg MSG_013 [P3 Fem Protag]]
*giggle* We're all counting on you two![n]Let's do it, team!
