The objective of this next special[n]screening is quite simple.
You must defeat one of the KNS-1000s[n]found within "A.I.G.I.S."

[msg MSG_001 [Fuuka]]
I take it, by "KNS-1000," you mean the[n]surveillance-type FOE, correct?

[msg MSG_002 [Aigis]]
I see. A troublesome opponent indeed.[n]However, I do possess some data on said[n]enemy.
This is a perfect opportunity to[n]calibrate my energy levels.

[msg MSG_003 [P3 Hero]]
Aigis, do you still need some time?

[msg MSG_004 [Aigis]]
Nonsense. All systems are functioning[n]properly.
However, I was not designed to fight in[n]these films.
In order to see that we accomplish our[n]missions, I must acquire some combat[n]experience.

[sel SEL_005 top]
Are you okay?
Don't push yourself.

[msg MSG_006 [Aigis]]
I appreciate the sentiment,-san.
However, I am an anti-Shadow weapon. My[n]duty is to protect all of you.
More difficult battles surely lie ahead,[n]and if I am to protect you, I will need[n]to be prepared.

[msg MSG_007 [Ann]]
That's... pretty cool.

[sel SEL_008 top]
We'll work together.
Don't bear it all by yourself.

[msg MSG_009 [Aigis]]
Work... together?

[msg MSG_010 [P3 Hero]]
is right, Aigis. We're a team.
There's no need for you to bear it all[n]by yourself. We'll work together.

[msg MSG_011 [Aigis]]
Understood! Then, let us all go to the[n]special screening together!

[msg MSG_012 [Aigis]]
Is that a no? I was hoping to provide[n]assistance...

[msg MSG_013 [P3 Hero]]
is right, Aigis. You don't have to bear[n]it all to yourself.
We're a team. We should all work[n]together.

[msg MSG_014 [Aigis]]
Thank you, both of you. Let us all do[n]our best!

[msg MSG_015 [P3 Hero]]
Okay, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0], let's head out once we're[n]ready.
