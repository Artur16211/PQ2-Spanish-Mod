Arf, arf!

[msg MSG_001 [Akechi]]
Yes, bones. It's just like you said,[n]Koromaru-kun.

[sel SEL_002 top]
Mind taking a look?
Isn't this dangerous?

[msg MSG_003 [Akechi]]
Certainly. Let's see...

[msg MSG_004 [Akechi]]
Haha, don't worry. Let me take a closer[n]look...

[msg MSG_005 [Akechi]]
Yes, this is definitely one of its[n]meals. It's fairly old, though.
If we stay on the trail, I'm sure we'll[n]find the beast eventually.

[msg MSG_006 [Chie]]
Wow, you're amazing, Koro-chan... Muku[n]would never be able to do that.

[msg MSG_007 [Koromaru]]
*sniff* *sniff* *sniff*
Arf, arf!

[msg MSG_008 [Ken]]
Koromaru looks really enthusiastic. He[n]says the trail leads north.

[msg MSG_009 [Akechi]]
Very well. North it is, then.
