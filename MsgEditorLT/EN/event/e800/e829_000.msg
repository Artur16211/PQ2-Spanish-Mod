Yo, it's a dead end.
Man this place is nuts. First it's up,[n]then it's down. What's next?

[msg MSG_001 [P4 Hero]]
Yeah, it's a puzzle for sure... Let's[n]take a break.

[msg MSG_002 [P3 Hero]]
Navigators, feel free to take a break[n]too. I'm sure you're tired as well.

[msg MSG_003 [Rise]]
Hey, thanks! Then, if you don't mind...
I'm gonna have a little snack. I'm[n]starving.

[msg MSG_004 [Futaba]]
Me too.

[msg MSG_005 [Kanji]]
Hahah, that was loud. Hey Oracle, I[n]could hear that from all the way over[n]here!

[msg MSG_006 [Futaba]]
Ugh, I want curry!
This is your fault, Kanji! Every time I[n]look at you, all I want to do is eat[n]curry!

[msg MSG_007 [Kanji]]
Huh? Curry? The hell you talkin' about?

[msg MSG_008 [Futaba]]
Your hair color, that big body ol' body[n]of yours...
You get me, don't you, Joker!?

[sel SEL_009 top]
Uh, no.
Sort of...

[msg MSG_010 [Futaba]]
Why not!? Can't you just picture him[n]eating it!?
Yellow's the powerful one and he loves[n]curry. It's elementary.

[msg MSG_011 [Futaba]]
Right!? Can't you just picture him[n]chowing down!?
Yellow's the powerful one and he loves[n]curry. It's a given.

[msg MSG_012 [Kanji]]
Sorry, I have no idea what you guys're[n]talkin' about...

[msg MSG_013 [Ken]]
Ohh, are you talking about Feather Owl?
The yellow ranger always likes curry.[n]It's kinda become a character trait over[n]the years.

[msg MSG_014 [Futaba]]
Ooh, Owl is from Featherman R! I take it[n]you're a fan?

[msg MSG_015 [Ken]]
N-No... I've just heard a lot from my[n]friend. I don't know much about it...
You like Featherman, Oracle?

[msg MSG_016 [Futaba]]
Heheh... I have all the movies and tons[n]of memorabilia.
And the current series is totally...[n]Whoops, I don't wanna spoil it.

[msg MSG_017 [Ken]]
Whoa! Featherman is still going in your[n]time!?

[msg MSG_018 [Futaba]]
Of course! Phoenix Ranger Featherman is[n]classic!

[msg MSG_019 [Ken]]
It is amazing, isn't it?
I want to be just like themâ€•brave enough[n]to stand against any opponent...
...That's what my friend was saying,[n]anyway.

[msg MSG_020 [Futaba]]
Come to think of it, there are five of[n]us.
Would you be Red, Ken? Or maybe the cool[n]Black?

[msg MSG_021 [Ken]]
I-I'm younger than everyone, so I'd say[n]Red is either Joker or-san.

[sel SEL_022 top]
Phoenix Ranger!
I wanna be Pink!

[msg MSG_023 [Futaba]]
Mwehehehe, now we're talkin'! I'll help[n]you cosplay!

[msg MSG_024 [Futaba]]
So we'd have Pink as the leader? Never[n]seen that before!

[msg MSG_025 [Kanji]]
Wh-What about me, then? Would I be[n]that... Yellow guy?

[msg MSG_026 [Futaba]]
Actually, you're probably the giant[n]skeleton monster!

[msg MSG_027 [Ken]]
Well... he is big. He'd definitely be a[n]challenge.

[msg MSG_028 [Kanji]]
Wait, so I'm a bad guy now!?

[msg MSG_029]
A new special screening: "Learning from[n]the Bad Guy" has been added to the box[n]office.
