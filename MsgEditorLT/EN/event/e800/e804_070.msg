[msg MSG_000 [Makoto]]
Well, we made it to the manhole. Is that[n]really all we needed to do?

[msg MSG_001 [Elizabeth]]
Yes, that will suffice.
Our intentions should now be clear. I[n]doubt the syndicate will make a move[n]anytime soon...

[msg MSG_002 [Makoto]]
...Syndicate?

[msg MSG_003 [Elizabeth]]
Oh, nothing. I was merely speaking to[n]myself. More importantly...
Well done overcoming those obstacles and[n]completing the mission.
It seems the MVP, or should I say, lead[n]female role, was none other than Chie.

[msg MSG_004 [Chie]]
M-Me!?

[msg MSG_005 [Ann]]
Yeah, you were really awesome at the end[n]there!
It was like watching an action movie. I[n]couldn't look away.

[msg MSG_006 [Chie]]
Ahaha... It's kinda embarrassing to hear[n]all that from you, Ann-chan.
In my opinion, you're way cooler than[n]me.
You're gorgeous, your English is great,[n]and you're a phantom thief! You're in[n]another league!

[sel SEL_007 top]
That's not true.
You're pretty amazing yourself.
I think Risette's the coolest.

[msg MSG_008 [Ryuji]]
Yeah, don't be so hard on yourself.[n]Ann's grades are terrible outside of[n]English.

[msg MSG_009 [Ann]]
Not as terrible as yours!
...Honestly, I think you're way cooler[n]than me, Chie-chan.

[msg MSG_010 [Chie]]
Huh?

[msg MSG_011 [Ann]]
Yeah. Honestly, I think you're way[n]cooler than me, Chie-chan.

[msg MSG_012 [Chie]]
Huh?

[msg MSG_013 [Rise]]
Me!?

[msg MSG_014 [Ryuji]]
Well, she is a national idol.

[msg MSG_015 [Chie]]
Rise-chan is pretty amazing, but I guess[n]I'm just used to her now...
She's also younger than me. I feel like[n]that makes the comparison a little[n]different.

[msg MSG_016 [Ann]]
I guess I do have a lot going for me...
But because of that, I've never really[n]known what I wanna do or what I wanna[n]work toward.
I've always been inspired by people who[n]try their hardest to get good at[n]something they like.

[msg MSG_017 [Chie]]
Inspired?

[msg MSG_018 [Ann]]
Yeah. You always get so excited whenever[n]you talk about things like kung fu or[n]meat.

[msg MSG_019 [Yosuke]]
I'll say...

[msg MSG_020 [Ann]]
But I think you inspired me even before[n]that...
I guess, when I see you doing your[n]thing, that's how I wanna be. I wanna do[n]my thing too.

[msg MSG_021 [Chie]]
How you wanna be...?
I haven't really thought much about my[n]future either, but...
I do know that I wanna get stronger so I[n]can protect my friends.

[sel SEL_022 top]
Aren't you the same, Ann?
You two are pretty alike.

[msg MSG_023 [Ann]]
...Yeah. I failed to protect someone[n]very important to me...
I told myself I'd grow stronger so no[n]one else would ever have to go through[n]what she did.

[msg MSG_024 [Chie]]
Is that why you wanted to learn kung fu?

[msg MSG_025 [Ann]]
It wasn't so much the kung fu I was[n]interested in as it was the strength of[n]your heart.
Sorry... I guess now it kinda sounds[n]like I tricked you.

[msg MSG_026 [Chie]]
No way! It's nice to know I'm fighting[n]alongside somebody who feels the same!
Plus, this whole thing was a great[n]learning experience.
I bet, if we work together, we can grow[n]even stronger. It's just like those[n]words of wisdom...

[sel SEL_027 top]
You mean a proverb?
"All-you-can-eat steak skewers."
"Two heads are better than one."

[msg MSG_028 [Chie]]
Yeah, a proverb. But which one was[n]it...?

[msg MSG_029 [Naoto]]
A phrase relating to teamwork... "Two[n]heads are better than one," perhaps?

[msg MSG_030 [Chie]]
Yeah, yeah! That's it!

[msg MSG_031 [Chie]]
Ooh, that sounds amazing... Wait, no,[n]that's not it!

[msg MSG_032 [Naoto]]
A phrase relating to teamwork... "Two[n]heads are better than one," perhaps?

[msg MSG_033 [Chie]]
Yeah, yeah! That's it!

[msg MSG_034 [Chie]]
Uh, yeah, I think that's it...?

[msg MSG_035 [Naoto]]
A phrase which suggests using teamwork[n]to achieve a goal.

[msg MSG_036 [Ann]]
Teamwork, huh...? Yeah, I'm sure we can[n]do that!
Just like how we worked together to[n]whoop those Shadows like "BAM!"

[msg MSG_037 [Chie]]
Yeah, if anyone gets on our bad side,[n]they're getting a double dose of "BAM!"

[sel SEL_038 top]
Sounds good.
Sounds scary.

[msg MSG_039 [P4 Hero]]
...Yeah.

[msg MSG_040 [Elizabeth]]
A sexy phantom thief and a fearless kung[n]fu master...
It would seem a new bond has begun to[n]flourish upon the completion of this[n]mission.
Also, my apologies for the slight delay,[n]but here is your reward.
