Well done on finding the Easter egg and[n]reaching the tear-jerking conclusion.

[msg MSG_001 [Junpei]]
I definitely felt like crying. Oh[n]well... it was still fun.

[msg MSG_002 [Naoto]]
There's still one thing that's bothering[n]me.
What did they mean by "find the Easter[n]egg"?

[msg MSG_003 [Junpei]]
Whaddaya mean? We found what we were[n]lookin' for, didn't we?

[msg MSG_004 [Naoto]]
Yes, but why "Easter egg"?
If this were a regular treasure hunt, we[n]could have attained a different prize.

[msg MSG_005 [Ann]]
Why...? Hmm, never really thought about[n]it.

[sel SEL_006 top]
Because it's festive?
There's no real reason.
It's a coincidence...?

[msg MSG_007 [Futaba]]
Hehehe. Yeah, whoever organized this[n]must've been in the Easter spirit.

[msg MSG_008 [Futaba]]
Hehehe. You're probably right.

[msg MSG_009 [Junpei]]
Maybe they were tryna "egg" us on?

[msg MSG_010 [Yukari]]
*sigh* Just ignore him,-kun.

[msg MSG_011 [Futaba]]
Nah, someone definitely planned this.

[msg MSG_012 [Ann]]
Huh? Figure something out, Futaba?

[msg MSG_013 [Futaba]]
Only just now, yeah! I hadn't thought[n]about it like this...
Sometimes programmers slip extras into[n]their games or apps just for fun.
Like a message that only displays if you[n]do a certain set of inputsâ€•similar to[n]cheat codes.
And they're called Easter eggs because[n]you normally gotta follow a buncha steps[n]to find 'em.

[msg MSG_014 [Fuuka]]
*giggle* How clever. So that's what was[n]going on in A.I.G.I.S.

[msg MSG_015 [Junpei]]
Ohhh... I don't get it!
Are you sayin' we got taken for a ride?

[msg MSG_016 [Ann]]
Who does something like that...?

[msg MSG_017 [Elizabeth]]
Now then, I wonder what the next special[n]screening will have in store.
