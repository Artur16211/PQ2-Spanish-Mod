Tsk. 'Nother dead end.

[msg MSG_001 [Naoto]]
......

[msg MSG_002 [P4 Hero]]
What's wrong, Naoto? Something on your[n]mind?

[msg MSG_003 [Naoto]]
Oh, nothing. There's just something I've[n]been trying to figure out.
Why are these movies set up like[n]labyrinths...?

[sel SEL_004 top]
It's a coincidence.
It's to make us get lost.
I haven't thought about it.

[msg MSG_005 [Naoto]]
That is a possibility. However, I feel[n]that they're far too well-designed to be[n]a coincidence.

[msg MSG_006 [Futaba]]
Make sure you're filling out the map so[n]that doesn't happen!

[msg MSG_007 [Naoto]]
Yes. Their layouts are very complex.

[msg MSG_008 [Ann]]
Now that you mention it... It is weird.[n]Why ARE they like that?

[msg MSG_009 [Futaba]]
I've been thinking about it too.
It's as if someone's trying to keep us[n]from going any further.

[msg MSG_010 [Naoto]]
Hm, this labyrinth is representative of[n]one's mental state... That's an[n]interesting hypothesis.

[msg MSG_011 [Ann]]
But who would do such a mean thing?

[msg MSG_012 [Naoto]]
I'm not certain... Though, based on past[n]experience, it's not out of the[n]question.

[msg MSG_013 [Chie]]
Yeah, I don't know what's going on, but[n]it definitely makes you use your head.
If it were just me, I wouldn't be able[n]to solve any of these gimmicks.

[msg MSG_014 [Ryuji]]
I ain't good at that stuff either. I[n]leave it to Joker.
Oracle too. She may be bratty, but she's[n]also a genius.

[msg MSG_015 [Futaba]]
"Bratty" wasn't that necessary, was it?
That said, I do like puzzle games. Leave[n]that stuff to me.

[msg MSG_016 [Yukiko]]
We also have Naoto-kun. She is a[n]detective, after all.

[msg MSG_017 [Naoto]]
Please, I'm nothing compared to Oracle.
But if there's ever anything I can do, I[n]will be more than willing to help.

[sel SEL_018 top]
We're counting on you.
Show us those detective skills.

[msg MSG_019 [Naoto]]
I'd be honored. Let's work together to[n]figure this out.
And the same goes to you, Oracleâ€•if[n]you'd be so kind as to offer us advice[n]when we're stumped.

[msg MSG_020 [Futaba]]
Y-Yeah! Let's all do our best!

[msg MSG_021]
A new special screening: "Officer[n]Imposter!" has been added to the box[n]office.
