Look! Over there!

[msg MSG_001 [Yukari]]
Whoa! Isn't that one a little too big!?

[msg MSG_002 [Yusuke]]
Such majesty... I can feel an aura of[n]resplendent dignity...

[sel SEL_003 top]
Let's catch it.
Get to work, Skull!

[msg MSG_004 [Futaba]]
Yeah, if anything is gonna be Zabby's[n]lunker, it's this huge boy.

[msg MSG_005 [Ryuji]]
Oh, sure, lemme just roll up andâ€•

[msg MSG_006 [Ryuji]]
Wait, why me!? You want me to handle[n]this alone...?

[msg MSG_007 [Futaba]]
Whoa, Skull's all scared over a[n]butterfly?

[msg MSG_008 [Ryuji]]
Hey, I'm not! I'm just on the spot[n]here...

[msg MSG_009 [Hikari]]
Oh!

[msg MSG_010]
The butterfly flew away...

[msg MSG_011 [Yukari]]
There it goes... It really was gigantic.

[msg MSG_012 [Hikari]]
Looks like it went through that hole up[n]there. Should we chase it down?

[msg MSG_013 [Morgana]]
A bug that big doesn't come along every[n]day. We might not get another chance.
Use that switch there! Let's catch it!
