Well, the opposition is heavier than[n]usual. We're not gonna be able to sneak[n]past 'em like always.

[msg MSG_001_02 [Rise]]
They look pretty frenzied too... They'll[n]probably be even more aggressive, so[n]watch out!

Ohh... I'm starting to get nervous.

[sel SEL_003 top]

Yeah, my hands are all sweaty.

[msg MSG_004 [Chie]]
...Focus, focus. Aw geez, now I'm even[n]more nervous...

Y-Yes, ma'am!
