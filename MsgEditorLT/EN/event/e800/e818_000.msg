[msg MSG_000 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Oh, it looks like it's a dead end. Let's[n]take a break.

[msg MSG_001 [Fuuka]]
There don't appear to be any enemies[n]nearby. What should we do?

[sel SEL_002 top]
A break sounds nice.
We can keep going.

[msg MSG_003 [Ann]]
Awesome! I've been wanting to take a[n]break anyway!

[msg MSG_004 [Junpei]]
Yeah, good choice!
You guys really know how to read a[n]crowd.

[msg MSG_005 [Ann]]
Hmm, everyone looks pretty tired. Maybe[n]we should take a break?

[msg MSG_006 [Junpei]]
C'mon, let's rest a bit. You guys ain't[n]too good at reading a crowd, are ya?

[msg MSG_007 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Ahaha, you're always the same, no matter[n]where we are, Junpei.

[msg MSG_008 [Yukari]]
Always?

[msg MSG_009 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Oh, sorry... I mean...

[msg MSG_010 [Junpei]]
In other words, you're sayin' Junpei's[n]always the life of the party, right?

[msg MSG_011 [Fuuka]]
Um... I don't know about that.

[msg MSG_012 [Yukari]]
Life of the party? More like a loudmouth[n]who's way too into himself.

[msg MSG_013 [Junpei]]
Sheesh, Yuka-tan, why you gotta be so[n]mean...?

[msg MSG_014 [P3 Fem Protag]]
......

[msg MSG_015 [Fuuka]]
-chan...?

[msg MSG_016 [P3 Fem Protag]]
...Oh, I-I'm gonna go talk to the[n]others! You guys enjoy your break!

[msg MSG_017 [Yukari]]
...

[msg MSG_018 [Junpei]]
I feel like there's a wall there...

[msg MSG_019 [Fuuka]]
It's as if she wants to mingle with all[n]of us but can't...

[msg MSG_020 [Yukari]]
She knows everybody, but nobody knows[n]her...
I'd have a really hard time with that.

[msg MSG_021 [Fuuka]]
So would I... [f 6 1 27 0 0 0]-chan doesn't show[n]it, since she tries to be optimistic,[n]but...
If only she could open up a little[n]more...

[msg MSG_022 [Junpei]]
Well, I can't think of anything to help[n]her right now... Guess we'll just have[n]to wait...

[msg MSG_023]
A new special screening: "A Bond Beyond[n]Worlds" has been added to the box[n]office.
