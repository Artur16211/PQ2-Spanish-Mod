So this is the second one, huh...? Seems[n]awfully shiny.
I know it's part of a Shadow, but if no[n]one told me, I might've ended up using[n]it as some kind of accessory.

[msg MSG_001 [P3 Fem Protag]]
That sounds like the Yukari I know.[n]She's got quite an eye for fashion!

[msg MSG_002 [Yukari]]
She does...?

[msg MSG_003 [Fuuka]]
That leaves just one more rare material.[n]You guys are going at a great pace!

[msg MSG_004 [P3 Fem Protag]]
It's all thanks to you, Fuuka. You're[n]just as reliable as ever.
Oh, of course, the other navigators are[n]great too, but I have to admit, I feel[n]very at home when you're navigating.
It's probably because I'm so used to[n]hearing your voice.

[msg MSG_005 [Fuuka]]
You're used to it?

[msg MSG_006 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Oh, right... I guess I mean the Fuuka in[n]my world.

[sel SEL_007 top]
Is there a difference?
It'd be fun to compare them.

[msg MSG_008 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Maybe the Fuuka here talks a little bit[n]faster? Hmm, probably not...
They're exactly alike in both their[n]personality and the way they talk.

[msg MSG_009 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hmm... I don't think there'd be any[n]differences.
They're exactly alike in both their[n]personality and the way they talk.

[msg MSG_010 [Yukari]]
Really... Is your Fuuka good with tech[n]too?

[msg MSG_011 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Yeah! She even knows how to use a[n]soldering iron!
But she's really bad when it comes to[n]cooking. She's even mistaken sugar for[n]flour...

[msg MSG_012 [Fuuka]]
......

[msg MSG_013 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Um, this is just the Fuuka I know!
I'm sure it's odd being compared to a[n]self you don't even know.

[msg MSG_014 [Fuuka]]
It's not that.
It's just, the more I hear, the more I[n]think the person you're talking about is[n]me.

[msg MSG_015 [Junpei]]
At first, it felt kinda weird having[n]someone you've never met know you really[n]well.
But if the other me says she's a friend,[n]then it's all good!
I mean, it's me. I can trust myself,[n]right?

[msg MSG_016 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Junpei...

[msg MSG_017 [Yukari]]
Huh, I guess he can say something nice[n]every once in a while.

[msg MSG_018 [Junpei]]
Oh, is everyone starting to see there's[n]more to Junpei than they thought? Sorry[n]to disappoint you, ladies.
But I'm afraid my heart belongs to[n]Chidorita...

[sel SEL_019 top]
Whatever.
Way to ruin it...
Let's go.

[msg MSG_020 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Why don't we leave Junpei here and keep[n]going?

[msg MSG_021 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Well, what else would you expect from[n]Junpei? C'mon, let's go.

[msg MSG_022 [Yukari]]
Yeah. Where to next, Fuuka?

[msg MSG_023 [Fuuka]]
The last thing we need is the Teddy Bear[n]from a Phantom Mage in 4-B.

[msg MSG_024 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Okay! Then, let's find it and hurry back[n]to Theo!

[msg MSG_025 [Fuuka]]
The last thing we need is the[n]Kaleidoscope from a Flowing Sand in 3-F.

[msg MSG_026 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Okay! Then, let's find it and hurry back[n]to Theo!

[msg MSG_027 [Fuuka]]
The last thing we need is the Clay[n]Figurine from a Rampage Drive.
You should be able to find one anywhere[n]on this floor.

[msg MSG_028 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Okay! Then, let's find it and hurry back[n]to Theo!
