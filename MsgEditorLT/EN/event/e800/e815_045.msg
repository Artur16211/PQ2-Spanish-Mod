Oh, there's some bones!

[msg MSG_001 [Naoto]]
Yes, and from the looks of it... I don't[n]think we'll need Crow's consensus.

[msg MSG_002 [Akechi]]
This is clearly a fresh kill; no doubt[n]the Ravenous Beast is near.

[msg MSG_003 [Teddie]]
Hrrm, my Teddie senses are going[n]bear-serk too!

[sel SEL_004 top]
Let's get ready.
Let's proceed carefully.
Let's run for it.

[msg MSG_005 [Akechi]]
Indeed, we should probably prepare[n]ourselves. We're about to face a very[n]dangerous opponent.

[msg MSG_006 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_007 [Akechi]]
Agreed. We could be attacked at any[n]time. We'll want to stay alert.

[msg MSG_008 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_009 [Koromaru]]
*whine*

[msg MSG_010 [Akechi]]
Well, it certainly is a dangerous[n]opponent. It might be a good idea to[n]regroup.

[msg MSG_011 [Futaba]]
Okay, the enemy is just up ahead! Don't[n]let your guard down!
