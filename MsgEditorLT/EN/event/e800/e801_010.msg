[msg MSG_000 [Elizabeth]]
Hello and welcome. Will you be[n]attempting a special screening?

[msg MSG_001 [Makoto]]
Yes, we'd like to try.

[msg MSG_002 [Haru]]
Based on the description, it sounds like[n]we just have to defeat the enemies,[n]right...?

[msg MSG_003 [Elizabeth]]
Hmhm. Rest assured, you won't be tasked[n]with doing anything unreasonable... yet.
Now, on to business. Might I ask that[n]you defeat eight Basalts?

[sel SEL_004 top]
Sounds easy.
No problem.

[msg MSG_005 [Haru]]
Mhm. We can handle that.

[msg MSG_006 [Makoto]]
That should be fine. I doubt we'll have[n]any issues at our current strength.

[msg MSG_007 [Elizabeth]]
That's very reassuring to hear.
I will be watching you from here with[n]popcorn in hand.
Let us now begin the special screening!
