Phew... That takes care of that.
A nightclub for Shadows, huh...? You[n]don't see that everyday.

[msg MSG_001 [Yosuke]]
We had to bust our asses because SOMEONE[n]had to rush up and try every stupid[n]trick in the book to get in...

[msg MSG_002 [Junpei]]
Sorry 'bout that... I guess that was[n]pretty immature... Being an adult's[n]harder than I thought.
But I ain't giving up yet. Plenty more[n]adult paradise waitin' for us out there[n]in the city that never sleeps!

[msg MSG_002_1 [Teddie]]
That's the spirit, Junpei! I'm stickin'[n]with you tonight!

[msg MSG_003 [Fuuka]]
Umm...

[msg MSG_004 [Teddie]]
Sorry, Fuu-chan, you'll have to leave a[n]message. We're headed to paradise...

[msg MSG_005 [Fuuka]]
But... Mitsuru-senpai's...

[msg MSG_005_1 [Mitsuru]]
You're all going to take responsibility[n]for acting so recklessly.

[msg MSG_005_2 [Mitsuru]]
You want to be adults? Fine, I'll send[n]you to paradise...

[msg MSG_006 [Futaba]]
Heheheh. Ooh, you guys are in trouble.[n]Looks like you're all gonna get it.

[msg MSG_007 [Yosuke]]
Whaâ€•? Hey! Leave me out of this!
Hey, Kanji! Teach this dumb bear a[n]lesson!

[msg MSG_008 [Kanji]]
Sir!

[msg MSG_009 [Teddie]]
N-Noo! My adulthood... it's slipping[n]away!

[msg MSG_010 [Junpei]]
Sorry, Teddie. We tried... We really[n]tried...

[msg MSG_011 [P3 Hero]]
...Haha. Well, at least we finished the[n]screening. Let's head back once we're[n]done being punished.
