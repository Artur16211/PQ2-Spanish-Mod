Huh!? She changed the story!?

[msg MSG_001 [Chie]]
I'm not sure why I'm even asking this,[n]but... how does the story end?

[msg MSG_002 [Yukiko]]
The girl learns the basics of cooking[n]from the puppet and becomes a[n]professional chef.
Then the two of them start a little[n]restaurant in the city and live happily[n]ever after.

[msg MSG_003 [Junpei]]
Happily!? Why happily!?

[msg MSG_004 [Yukari]]
*sigh* This is exhausting.
And, Junpei, would you give the stupid[n]storytelling a rest? You're wasting our[n]time.

[msg MSG_005 [Junpei]]
What!? But I got shut down before I[n]could even get to the good part!

[msg MSG_006 [Yukiko]]
And there you have it, folks. Tune in[n]next week for another exciting episode[n]of "Yukiko's Believe It, or Don't."

[msg MSG_007 [Chie]]
Huh? Another episode?

[msg MSG_008 [Makoto]]
*sigh* Come on, that's enough chatter.[n]Let's get going already.

[msg MSG_009 [Makoto]]
Eeek!

[msg MSG_010 [Junpei]]
Huh? Scared just like that?

[msg MSG_011 [Futaba]]
I know it's a rare treat to see Queen be[n]the scaredy-cat, but we don't have time[n]to stand around.
That sound was either a Shadow or a[n]robot... Whatever it is, it isn't[n]friendly, so be on your guard.

[msg MSG_012 [Makoto]]
I-I know. We need to stay focused with[n]enemies around.

[msg MSG_013 [Yukari]]
Ngh, it'd be nice if we could just avoid[n]them... Guess we'd better keep moving.
