So we just gotta go where the map says[n]and beat the enemies there, right?

[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
Heh! Piece of cake! Let's go this way...

[msg MSG_002 [Kanji]]
All right! Then, let's go that way...

[msg MSG_003 [Ryuji]]
...Huh?

[msg MSG_004 [Kanji]]
...What's that?

[msg MSG_005 [Chie]]
Oookay, guys, no fighting!
Sorry, everyone. I think Kanji-kun's a[n]little too excited about this.

[msg MSG_006 [Teddie]]
Kanjiii, what's wrong? If you're good,[n]I'll give you a bananaaa.

[msg MSG_007 [Kanji]]
D-Don't treat me like some kinda animal,[n]damn it!

[msg MSG_008 [Ann]]
No, no. We're sorry too.
Skull gets upset pretty easily. He's[n]like a wild gorilla.

[msg MSG_009 [Ryuji]]
The hell!? You treatin' me like an[n]animal too!?

[sel SEL_010 top]
Stop fighting.
We're gonna leave you behind.

[msg MSG_011 [Ryuji]]
Psh...

[msg MSG_012 [Kanji]]
...My bad.

[msg MSG_013 [Futaba]]
Heheh. It's hard being the boss when[n]you've got two big kids to look after.
It doesn't matter which enemy we start[n]with! Take your pick and lead the way,[n]Joker!
