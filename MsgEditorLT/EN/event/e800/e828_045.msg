[msg MSG_000 [Ken]]
This way should be safe, right?
Let's follow Joker's lead and keep[n]going.

[sel SEL_001 top]
Right.
I've changed my mind.

[msg MSG_002 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_003 [Morgana]]
Oh? Couldn't leave that treasure alone[n]after all, huh?

[msg MSG_004 [Aigis]]
We will leave it to you to decide which[n]path we take.

[msg MSG_005 [Ken]]
Huh? Didn't you say to go left? This way[n]leads to the FOE.

[msg MSG_006 [Morgana]]
Nyahaha! That's the spirit, Joker! We're[n]not gonna leave that treasure behind!

[msg MSG_007 [Aigis]]
Will you go toward the FOE or take the[n]path to the left?

[sel SEL_008 top]
Let's go straight!
I took a wrong turn.

[msg MSG_009 [Morgana]]
That's more like it! The treasure's as[n]good as ours!

[msg MSG_010 [Morgana]]
What? Aw, c'mon! You got my hopes up and[n]everything...

[msg MSG_011 [Ken]]
There's an FOE this way, right? Are you[n]sure we'll be okay...?

[msg MSG_012 [Morgana]]
Hey, there's treasure too! We're going[n]this way, right Joker?

[sel SEL_013 top]
Right.
I've changed my mind.

[msg MSG_014 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_015 [Morgana]]
All right! Get ready, everyoneâ€•
Wait, WHAT!? We're not going this way!?

[msg MSG_016 [Aigis]]
We will leave it to you to decide which[n]path we take.

[msg MSG_017 [Ken]]
Huh? You want to go this way instead?
This is the path without any FOEs or[n]treasure chests.

[msg MSG_018 [Morgana]]
Are you really giving up on the[n]treasure, Joker?
I guess it's better than getting wiped[n]out by an FOE and losing everything...

[msg MSG_019 [Aigis]]
Will you continue this way or head[n]toward the FOE?

[sel SEL_020 top]
Let's go this way.
I took a wrong turn.

[msg MSG_021 [Morgana]]
Hmm... I don't exactly agree, but it's[n]your call, Joker.

[msg MSG_022 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Better safe than sorry, right? Let's go!

[msg MSG_023 [Morgana]]
After all's said and done, you can't[n]forget about the treasure either, can[n]you, Joker?

[msg MSG_024 [Aigis]]
We will leave it to you to decide which[n]path we take.

[msg MSG_025 [Aigis]]
Will you continue along this path?

[sel SEL_026 top]
Let's go this way.
I need to think.

[msg MSG_027 [Aigis]]
Understood. Let us proceed.
