[msg MSG_000 [Theodore]]
Oh, hello, everyone. How are you doing?

[msg MSG_001 [Elizabeth]]
...Villain!
That suspicious attire... Hold it right[n]there! I'll cut you down where you[n]stand!

[msg MSG_002 [Theodore]]
S-Sister, please. It's me, Theodore.

[msg MSG_003 [Elizabeth]]
Hm?
Oh, it appears I've jumped the gun. Now[n]that I get a closer look at you, I see[n]you're just my brother.

[msg MSG_004 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Theo? What are you doing here?

[msg MSG_005 [Theodore]]
About that... I came here because I have[n]a request.

[sel SEL_006 top]
A request?
Something wrong?

[msg MSG_007 [Theodore]]
Well, if you're able...
There's something I'd like to get my[n]hands on.
They call it a "Futuristic Gizmo"!

[msg MSG_008 [Naoto]]
Futuristic Gizmo...?

[msg MSG_009 [Theodore]]
Yes. The "Junessic Land" film you[n]journeyed through...
Apparently, it is home to a multitude of[n]next-generation technology.

[msg MSG_010 [Makoto]]
Now that you mention it, that film does[n]take place in the future.
The people there were able to revive[n]dinosaurs with their technology.

[msg MSG_011 [Junpei]]
But if we're talking about the future,[n]wouldn't "A.I.G.I.S." be better?
There's way more tech there, y'know?

[msg MSG_012 [Naoto]]
Hmm, about that...

[msg MSG_013 [Fuuka]]
The technology used in "Junessic Land"[n]is a little different from the[n]technology we saw in "A.I.G.I.S."
That which is found in "A.I.G.I.S." was[n]derived from fictional physics...

[msg MSG_014 [Naoto]]
Yes, that's exactly it!
And the technology found in "Junessic[n]Land" was derived from real-world[n]physics.

[msg MSG_015 [Ryuji]]
R-Right... So, uh... physics?

[msg MSG_016 [Futaba]]
Hmm... They're tuning out the normies so[n]they can speak geek with each other.

[msg MSG_017 [Theodore]]
Ah, you two know quite a lot.

[msg MSG_018 [Naoto]]
-san, is it all right with you if we[n]search for this "Futuristic Gizmo"?

[sel SEL_019 top]
Okay.
Fine by me.

[msg MSG_020 [Theodore]]
Much appreciated, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0].
And if we consider it a special[n]screening, I'll be able to present you[n]with a reward.
With that, Sister, would you please[n]create a...

[msg MSG_021 [Elizabeth]]
......

[msg MSG_022 [Theodore]]
...Sister?

[msg MSG_023 [Elizabeth]]
Wh-Where did this mysterious, costumed[n]rogue come from...!?

[msg MSG_024 [Theodore]]
*sigh*

[msg MSG_025]
A new special screening: "Long-lost[n]Tech" has been added to the box office.
