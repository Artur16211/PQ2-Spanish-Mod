The time has come!

[msg MSG_001 [Kanji]]
Uh... for what?

[msg MSG_002 [Elizabeth]]
Ever since you arrived in this world,[n]you've faced one arduous struggle after[n]another...
With how far you've come, I believe you[n]may now be strong enough to overcome[n]this new challenge...
I speak of none other than the next[n]special screening!
This time, you will be tasked with[n]entering Kamo City and defeating the[n]chicken FOE!

[msg MSG_003 [Ann]]
You mean that big creep holding the[n]chicken leg?

[msg MSG_004 [Elizabeth]]
That is correct.

[msg MSG_005 [Morgana]]
Hah. This should be easy. We've already[n]beat his kind before!
It'll be business as usual, but with a[n]greater reward. That sounds pretty good[n]to me.

[msg MSG_006 [Morgana]]
At first, we had no choice but to run[n]away... but we've grown a lot stronger[n]since then.
We can probably handle him now, don't[n]you think? Let's give it a try.

[msg MSG_007 [Yusuke]]
I would also like to take part in this[n]special screening.

[msg MSG_008 [Ryuji]]
Ohh, I just remembered!
I knew I'd seen a huge hunk of meat[n]somewhere! So that's where it was...

[msg MSG_009 [Chie]]
Huge hunk of meat!?
All right, let's take 'im out! That[n]chicken is mine!

[msg MSG_010 [Yusuke]]
Edible art, hm...? I look forward to it.

[msg MSG_011 [P4 Hero]]
...Sounds like he and Chie plan on[n]eating it.

[msg MSG_012 [Naoto]]
Yes... It would certainly seem that way.

[msg MSG_013 [Akechi]]
Wait a minute. It may look like meat at[n]first glance, but there's no guarantee[n]it's edible...

[msg MSG_014 [Chie]]
Eating is believing! We'll never know[n]unless we try!

[msg MSG_015 [Yusuke]]
Agreed. I can suppress neither my[n]passion for art nor my passion for food.

[msg MSG_016 [Morgana]]
Geez, it sounds like they're dead set on[n]eating that thing... Maybe you should[n]say something.

[sel SEL_017 top]
Defeating the FOE comes first.
It's a meat buffet!
Knock yourselves out.

[msg MSG_018 [Chie]]
Right, right, right! And then we get the[n]meat!

[msg MSG_019 [Morgana]]
What!? You're in on this too!?

[msg MSG_020 [Chie]]
A buffet! I like the sound of that![n]Let's hurry up and take it down!

[msg MSG_021 [Yusuke]]
Very well, we'll do as we please. I[n]suggest we bring along some containers[n]for the meat.

[msg MSG_022 [Chie]]
Oh! Me too!

[msg MSG_023 [Yosuke]]
Man, you guys really are set on doing[n]this.
Well, if it's FOE meat you want, I guess[n]I oughta lend a hand.

[msg MSG_024 [P4 Hero]]
Yosuke... are you hungry too?

[msg MSG_025 [Yosuke]]
I ain't lookin' to eat it!
It's just... Well... I feel like it's[n]time I start pulling my own weight[n]again, you know?
I was separated from everyone for all[n]that time, so I haven't really had a[n]chance to show my stuff.

[msg MSG_026 [P4 Hero]]
......

[msg MSG_027 [Elizabeth]]
*chuckle* Monstrous appetites, lingering[n]curiosity, and other complex motivations[n]as well...
Though your reasons may differ, you are[n]all united in your resolve to see this[n]through.
However, remember that you will be[n]facing an FOE... I ask that you please[n]remain vigilant to the end.
