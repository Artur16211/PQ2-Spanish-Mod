Phantom thieves, huh...?

[msg MSG_001 [Morgana]]
Hm? What's up?

[msg MSG_002 [Ken]]
Oh, nothing. It's just... changing into[n]a costume and fighting evil sounds like[n]something you'd see in a comic book.
So... why did you guys become phantom[n]thieves?

[sel SEL_003 top]
We were wronged.
It just kinda happened.
Because it's cool.

[msg MSG_004 [Ken]]
Wronged?

[msg MSG_005 [Ryuji]]
Buncha shitty adults... We'd all seen[n]firsthand how messed up they can be.

[msg MSG_006 [Ryuji]]
Well, yeah, it started out that way...
But then we made it our goal to stop all[n]those assholes who thought they could do[n]whatever they wanted.

[msg MSG_007 [Morgana]]
Well, I guess that's true.
It does sound pretty cool to smite evil[n]in the name of justice, doesn't it?

[msg MSG_008 [Ann]]
We were planning on it being a one-time[n]thing...
But then we realized we weren't the only[n]ones adults were taking advantage of.
So we kept going, hoping we could make a[n]difference.

[msg MSG_009 [Morgana]]
And thus the Phantom Thieves were[n]bornâ€•protecting the weak and changing[n]the hearts of the wicked!

[msg MSG_010 [Ken]]
Changing the hearts of the wicked...
......

[msg MSG_011 [Morgana]]
You okay, Ken?

[msg MSG_012 [Ken]]
Oh, I'm fine. Thank you for sharing!

[msg MSG_013 [Ann]]
...What's up with Ken-kun?

[msg MSG_014 [Ryuji]]
Well, he is that age, you know?
Every guy has a time when he wants to be[n]a superhero.

[msg MSG_015 [Ann]]
...Really?

[msg MSG_016]
A new special screening: "A Lesson in[n]Justice" has been added to the box[n]office.
