Well now, I'd say we're much closer to[n]the container than before.

[msg MSG_001 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_002 [Yusuke]]
Haha, what is it? Those sparkly eyes[n]tell me you want something.

[msg MSG_003 [Koromaru]]
Arf, arf!

[msg MSG_004 [Ken]]
I think he wants you to play with him,[n]Fox.

[msg MSG_005 [Futaba]]
Ohh, good for you, Fox. I'm sure you[n]two'll get along great.

[msg MSG_006 [Fuuka]]
It looks like Koro-chan's interested in[n]Fox's tail.
It is fluffy, after all. Maybe he thinks[n]you're like him.

[msg MSG_007 [Koromaru]]
Arf, arf!

[msg MSG_008 [Yusuke]]
Now that I look at you, you are rather[n]cute.
It certainly feels different playing[n]with a dog. I've grown somewhat[n]accustomed to cats lately.

[msg MSG_009 [Morgana]]
What do you mean "somewhat"!? Also, I'm[n]not a cat!

[msg MSG_010 [Futaba]]
The joke's basically a tradition at this[n]point...

[msg MSG_011 [Naoto]]
I like cats...
Not only are they cute, but they also[n]have an air of nobility about them.

[msg MSG_012 [Morgana]]
See, Naoto gets it. You may touch my paw[n]if you like.
...I'm not a cat, though!

[msg MSG_013 [Fuuka]]
Um, I don't mean to spoil the fun, but[n]we should probably get going.
The container is just up ahead. Be[n]careful, everyone.
