[msg MSG_000 [Rise]]
Here we are! See? There's a lot, right?

[msg MSG_001 [Yusuke]]
Yes... We can eat these! This one...[n]That one...! Hahahaha! It's a gold mine!

[msg MSG_002 [Chie]]
Oh, please... It's just a buncha[n]grass...

[msg MSG_003 [Ann]]
Well, whatever, let's gather what we[n]can. I'm sure Fox'll tell us if it's[n]good or not.

[msg MSG_004]
We decided to gather some edible wild[n]plants...

[msg MSG_005 [Futaba]]
A bunch of Persona-users collecting wild[n]plants... You don't see that every day.

[msg MSG_006 [Junpei]]
Ughhh... My back's startin' to hurt. I'm[n]gonna take a break...

[msg MSG_007 [Futaba]]
C'mon, Junpei. Giving up already? You[n]noob.

[msg MSG_008 [Junpei]]
No way! I'm just gettin' started!
Energy charge complete, aaand... it's[n]time for Junpei, Ace Collective!
Here we go! Double blades, baby![n]Woooooo!

[msg MSG_009 [Yukari]]
You idiot! You're getting it all over[n]me!

[msg MSG_010 [Haru]]
Fox, what about this one?

[msg MSG_011 [Yusuke]]
This one's good. A little bit of salt[n]after it's fried, and it should taste[n]great.
This one's a bit bitter, but if we can[n]prepare it well enough...

[msg MSG_012 [Shinjiro]]
Huh... You know your stuff. Why is that?

[msg MSG_013 [Yusuke]]
Are you referring to my knowledge of[n]wild plants?

[sel SEL_014 top]
He really likes them.
It's because he's poor.
He's just a weirdo.

[msg MSG_015 [Yusuke]]
Well, I like wild plants. To be able to[n]survive off nature's blessings alone is[n]a truly wonderful thing.
But, truthfully, there is another[n]reason...

[msg MSG_016 [Yusuke]]
Exactly! And, as a poor man, this is an[n]excellent way to save money!

[msg MSG_017 [Yusuke]]
A weirdo!?

[msg MSG_018 [Yusuke]]
Nature is food to me... Wild plants[n]included. I had to learn this to stay[n]alive.

[msg MSG_019 [Akihiko]]
It's almost like you're training. Still,[n]it doesn't exactly seem like you're[n]doing it willingly.

[msg MSG_020 [Yusuke]]
Right. I may be fortunate enough to go[n]to school, but I don't necessarily have[n]the money to live as I please.
Nor do I have a family for support.

[msg MSG_021 [Shinjiro]]
......

[msg MSG_022 [Yusuke]]
If I'm to keep pursuing beauty, I need[n]money. Art supplies are far from cheap,[n]but I can't make any compromises.
That said, I can't create anything if[n]I'm dead. It is this struggle that fuels[n]me.
I strive to insert every part of my[n]being into my art... It's what's kept me[n]going all this time.

[msg MSG_023 [Akihiko]]
That's a pretty stoic way of thinking...[n]But I like it.

[msg MSG_024 [Yusuke]]
Yes, you understand me, Sanada-san!

[msg MSG_025 [Akihiko]]
Yeah. I know the feeling of making[n]sacrifices to get what you truly want.
If it means getting stronger... then I'm[n]more than willing to risk my life.

[msg MSG_026 [Shinjiro]]
......
Damn... To think there's another clumsy[n]dumbass here.
Okay, screw it. I'll let you guys eat[n]all you want. Just go get some more[n]ingredients.

[msg MSG_027 [P4 Hero]]
We've gathered up a lot of wild plants.[n]This should be enough.

[msg MSG_028 [Akihiko]]
...No, not yet.
There isn't enough protein! We won't[n]build any muscle from this!

[msg MSG_029 [Junpei]]
Whaaaâ€•!? You're really gonna worry about[n]that!?

[msg MSG_030 [Akechi]]
I do agree that plants might not be[n]enough. Perhaps if we had some type of[n]meat or fish?

[sel SEL_031 top]
Definitely meat.
Let's do fish.
Protein powder?

[msg MSG_032 [Chie]]
Oh, me too! Meat, meat, meat!

[msg MSG_033 [Makoto]]
But we all ready used up all the frozen[n]meat in the containers...

[msg MSG_034 [Akihiko]]
Hmph, there's meat roaming around all[n]over this place. Want me to go get us[n]some?

[msg MSG_035 [Shinjiro]]
Don't be stupid. You're not gonna run[n]off by yourself again, are you?

[msg MSG_036 [Morgana]]
Fish! That sounds great!
Heheh! I'll finally get to eat some[n]sushi!

[msg MSG_037 [Makoto]]
What? Prehistoric sushi!? I feel like[n]it'd take some serious guts to eat that[n]kind of fish raw...

[msg MSG_038 [Shinjiro]]
Sorry, but I can't make sushi. The best[n]I can do is cook the fish.

[msg MSG_039 [Akihiko]]
I suppose that'll work. It'll definitely[n]provide protein.

[msg MSG_040 [Shinjiro]]
Hell no. Go get some real food.

[msg MSG_041 [Yusuke]]
Ngh... My vision is blurring...! I don't[n]think I can go on...

[msg MSG_042 [Shinjiro]]
Look, this guy's gonna die from hunger[n]if we don't do somethin' fast.
Fish is probably our best bet. Pretty[n]sure there'd be some kinda river or[n]something like that around here.

[msg MSG_043 [Fuuka]]
Now that you mention it, I do remember[n]seeing what looked like a pond earlier.
It's at the northeastern corner of this[n]floor. Perhaps you should take a look?

[msg MSG_044 [Morgana]]
Okay, we're off to catch some fish![n]Let's go before Fox faints!
