Good evening, and welcome to "Yukiko's[n]Believe It, or Don't."
Maybe it was just me... but did anyone[n]else feel a strange presence during the[n]investigation?
Did anyone hear the faint sound of[n]footsteps from behind as we walked[n]through the research facility...?

Wha―!? Yukiko!?

Wait, stop...

I, too, was unable to resist... So I[n]turned around.
When I did, I was met with the[n]silhouette of a strange man who seemed[n]to be glaring at me.
His face was pale and without any trace[n]of life. His eyes were wide-open and[n]bloodshot.
Cold sweat ran down the back of my neck.[n]I thought to myself, "This is bad..."[n]Then, suddenly―

[msg MSG_005 [Makoto]]
Noooooo!

[msg MSG_006 [Yukiko]]
The man inched his way over to us, and[n]from his twisted mouth he cried "I'm so[n]hungry! Can you spare some food!?"
