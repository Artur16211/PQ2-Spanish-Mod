Chur-ros, chur-ros, sweet, sugary[n]churroooooos!

[msg MSG_001 [P3 Fem Protag]]
*giggle* Panther sure is in a good mood.[n]I'm excited too, though.

[msg MSG_002 [Morgana]]
I'm in a good mood just from watching[n]her!

[msg MSG_003 [Ryuji]]
Man, you really like sweets. Is that all[n]you think about?

[msg MSG_004 [Ann]]
Shut up! At least I'm not a total[n]bonehead like you!

[msg MSG_005 [Ryuji]]
Bonehead...?
Who you callin' a bonehead!?

[msg MSG_006 [Rise]]
You love sweets that much, and you still[n]have a body like that?

[msg MSG_007 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Yeah, it's so cool that you're a model.[n]You must work out when no one's[n]watching.

[msg MSG_008 [Ann]]
Haha... I tend to give in to my cravings[n]pretty often and usually have to work[n]really hard to get back into shape.

[msg MSG_009 [Rise]]
Still, you're probably one of the best[n]in the business! I'm so jealous.

[msg MSG_010 [Ann]]
C-C'mon guys, you're making me blush.
But it also makes me really happy to[n]hear you say that, so thanks!

[msg MSG_011 [Rise]]
You're stylish, and you know how to[n]dress. Can you teach me how to[n]coordinate my outfits?

[msg MSG_012 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Oh! Me too!
Maybe after Theo makes us the churros we[n]can chit-chat while we eat.

[msg MSG_013 [Rise]]
That sounds great! I'll make some tea!

[msg MSG_014 [Ryuji]]
...Well, they're havin' fun.

[msg MSG_015 [Kanji]]
Yeah... Probably gonna be a while.

[msg MSG_016 [Futaba]]
All this girliness... It's too much to[n]handle!
You'd better go get that cinnamon! We[n]can't let them down!
We're getting closer to our targets, so[n]head over to whichever one you want!
