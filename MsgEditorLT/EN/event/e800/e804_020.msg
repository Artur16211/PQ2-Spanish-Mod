Is everybody ready?
The location Elizabeth specified is a[n]manhole just north of here.

[msg MSG_001 [Futaba]]
If I remember right, we'll have to sneak[n]by a bunch of searchlights to get there.

[msg MSG_002 [Yosuke]]
This kind of thing's the Phantom[n]Thieves' specialty, right?

[sel SEL_003 top]
We're used to this.
Leave it to us.
I say we charge right in!

[msg MSG_004 [Yusuke]]
Yes, avoiding detection is commonplace[n]when infiltrating a Palace.

[msg MSG_005 [Teddie]]
How are you always so calm? It's almost[n]disturbing...

[msg MSG_006 [Naoto]]
*chuckle* We're counting on you.

[msg MSG_007 [Ryuji]]
Yeah! At the end of the day, it's all[n]about brute force!

[msg MSG_008 [Morgana]]
And you guys call yourselves phantom[n]thieves!

[msg MSG_009 [Kanji]]
So we just gotta avoid gettin' spotted,[n]right?

[msg MSG_010 [Morgana]]
Do you think you'll be all right? This[n]is going to take precision and a good[n]eye for subtleties.

[msg MSG_011 [Rise]]
If that's the case, Kanji should be[n]great at this!

[msg MSG_012 [Kanji]]
I-I ain't nothin' special...

[msg MSG_013 [Yukiko]]
Chie is pretty nimble too. Maybe she'd[n]be a good fit?

[msg MSG_014 [Chie]]
Well, I am pretty athletic, but I'm not[n]exactly graceful, you know...?

[msg MSG_015 [Ann]]
Don't worry! Just follow my lead!

[msg MSG_016 [Chie]]
O-Okay!

[msg MSG_017 [Teddie]]
Hrrm... They seem to be getting along[n]really well. I'm jealous...

[msg MSG_018 [Morgana]]
Quit wasting time. We've got a manhole[n]to find.
