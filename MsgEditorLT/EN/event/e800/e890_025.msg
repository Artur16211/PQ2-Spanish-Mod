[msg MSG_000 [Caroline]]
Ngh... Looks like he actually beat us.[n]I'm impressed, Inmate.

[msg MSG_001 [Justine]]
What a surprise... I didn't know you had[n]amassed such power.

[sel SEL_002 top]
Same to you.
It's thanks to my team.

[msg MSG_003 [Caroline]]
Heh... Well, you're bold, I'll give you[n]that. I guess you really have proven[n]yourself.

[msg MSG_004 [Justine]]
That was an earnest appraisal of his[n]opponents, too. I'd say his[n]rehabilitation is going well.

[msg MSG_005 [Justine]]
I see... Yes, you've proven that you[n]have many fine confidants at your side.

[msg MSG_006 [Caroline]]
Hmph. So you've been taking our advice[n]to heart, then. I guess you haven't just[n]been playing around.

[msg MSG_007 [Elizabeth]]
That was a splendid bout. Both sides[n]gave a splendid showing of power.

[msg MSG_007_1 [Elizabeth]]
Now then, as for the film...

[msg MSG_008]
The film that looked sooty is now[n]glowing faintly...

[msg MSG_009 [Junpei]]
All right! There it goes!

[msg MSG_010]
......!
The three pieces of film are shining[n]even brighter together...!

[msg MSG_011 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Whoa, I think all three of them are[n]resonating... There's something really[n]mystic about all this.

[msg MSG_012]
The shine quietly ebbed away...

[msg MSG_013 [Teddie]]
Hunh? It went back to how it was. Was[n]that still not enough?

[msg MSG_014 [Naoto]]
But from the looks of it, we're only one[n]step away from the truth.

[msg MSG_015 [Elizabeth]]
Indeed, I shall look forward to the next[n]ticket specifying a cast.
Now, you are due a reward. I have[n]prepared something for your troubles...
...A splendid item that will be useful[n]in fierce battles, provided to you by[n]this impertinent duo.

[sel SEL_016 top]
Thank you.
I'll treasure it.

[msg MSG_017 [Caroline]]
D-Don't get the wrong idea, Inmate!
It's just that we can't have you dying[n]out in those movies! It'd be too[n]anticlimactic!

[msg MSG_018 [Justine]]
This is no gift... merely clutter we no[n]longer have the space for. Use or[n]discard it as you please.

[msg MSG_019 [Futaba]]
Mweheheh, they're still keeping up the[n]act... One day they're gonna go full[n]dere, and it's gonna be awesome.

[msg MSG_020 [Elizabeth]]
Oh, I almost forgot.
I also have your hot dog prepared here.[n]It shall go to the victor,.

[msg MSG_021 [Caroline]]
Grrr... How humiliating!
Of all people, the prisoner gets one!?[n]That was supposed to be our prize!

[msg MSG_022 [Makoto]]
Wow, she seems pretty worked up. I[n]didn't know she liked these so much.

[msg MSG_023 [Fuuka]]
I almost feel kind of bad taking it...

[sel SEL_024 top]
You two can have it...
It's all ours.

[msg MSG_025 [Caroline]]
What!? Do you mean it!?

[msg MSG_026 [Justine]]
...Ahem.

[msg MSG_027 [Caroline]]
Oh, uhh...

[msg MSG_028 [Caroline]]
O-Of course it is! You won! And it's not[n]like I need it or anything...

[msg MSG_029 [Kanji]]
Man, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]-san, do ya have to be so[n]tough on kids...?

[msg MSG_030 [Justine]]
You are embarrassing us, Caroline.
To begin with, we've already secured our[n]share.
And we made sure to hide where would-be[n]thieves could never find it.

[msg MSG_031 [Caroline]]
Well, um... that's...

[msg MSG_032 [Justine]]
......?

[msg MSG_033 [Caroline]]
R-R-Right! And we've still got a[n]mountain left for us, anyway! Hahaha!

[msg MSG_034 [Ryuji]]
What was that about?

[msg MSG_035 [Junpei]]
Beats me...

[msg MSG_036 [Elizabeth]]
Now then, everyone. Thank you for your[n]hard work.
It seems we're barely a step away from[n]uncovering the film's secret.
Perhaps the next special screening with[n]a specified cast will present the climax[n]of this mystery.
I will be waiting, heart aflutter in[n]anticipation. Until then, I bid you[n]adieu.

[msg PERSONA_STOCK_UP_MSG]
Overcoming this ordeal has strengthened[n]the power of the wild card. Your Persona[n]stock has increased by .

The effect of [f 4 4 3 0 1595] allows[n]for Boost state to carry over into the[n]next battle through Finish Bonuses.
