So you managed to root out the truth of[n]the complex labyrinth, and made it to[n]safety.
Just as the word "GROW" guided you, the[n]path you followed was indeed one of[n]self-betterment.

[msg MSG_001 [Yosuke]]
Uh huh. I had a feeling you'd bring that[n]up.

[msg MSG_002 [P4 Hero]]
Heh... Sounds familiar.

[msg MSG_003 [Yukari]]
It's weird, though. The entire labyrinth[n]really did change somehow.

[msg MSG_004 [P3 Hero]]
Maybe there's some hidden meaning to[n]it... or maybe I'm overthinking it.

[msg MSG_005 [Teddie]]
The heart of a labyrinth is allowed to[n]change! Just like the heart of a fair[n]bear maiden!

[msg MSG_006 [Rise]]
Ahaha! Whatever you say.

[msg MSG_007 [Shinjiro]]
You still hangin' out way over here?

[msg MSG_008 [Akechi]]
Hahaha... You're one to talk.
Sorry, I don't mean to worry you. You[n]needn't feel obligated to talk to me.

[msg MSG_009 [Shinjiro]]
Nah, that ain't it.
Kinda feels like we're the same, is all.[n]Nice to talk to another guy who doesn't[n]fit in.

[msg MSG_010 [Akechi]]
You and I...? The same?

[msg MSG_011 [Shinjiro]]
Besides, I can tell you'reâ€•

[msg MSG_012 [Akihiko]]
Shinji, give me a hand! I got you a[n]mitt, so help me do some drills!
Hey, Shinji! Where'd you go?

[msg MSG_013 [Akechi]]
Sounds like you're needed elsewhere. Go[n]on, don't worry about me.

[msg MSG_014 [Akechi]]
I suspect... we're not as similar as you[n]think.
I've chosen my own path. That's all[n]there is to it, I'm afraid.

[msg MSG_015 [Shinjiro]]
......
Look, I don't know your life, but let me[n]just say this.
I've done a lot of bad shit. Wish I[n]could undo some of it. But since I[n]can't, I try to live with no regrets.
That's all. See ya.

[msg MSG_016 [Akechi]]
......
I really am sorry... but I just don't[n]understand.

[msg MSG_017 [Akechi]]
..."Regrets," indeed.
