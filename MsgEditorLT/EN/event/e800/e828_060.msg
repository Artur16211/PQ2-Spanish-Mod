Hang on, we'll fix you right up...!

[msg MSG_001 [Aigis]]
I shall begin the repairs right away.[n]Please wait a moment.

[msg MSG_002 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Okay. Go for it, Aigis!

[msg MSG_003 [Ken]]
Yes! It moved!

[msg MSG_004 [Broken robot]]
......

[msg MSG_005 [Ann]]
Huh? What's going on...? Did it not[n]work?

[msg MSG_006 [Broken robot]]
Gggg... ggg...

[msg MSG_007 [Aigis]]
It appears its systems are not fully[n]operational just yet.
It did manage to boot, however. So its[n]communication functions should[n]reactivate soon.

[msg MSG_008 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Oh, that's a relief...

[msg MSG_009 [Broken robot]]
Ggg... ggg... gg...

[msg MSG_010 [Ken]]
Um... Is this an error?

[msg MSG_011 [Aigis]]
No, it's...

[msg MSG_012 [Broken robot]]
Ggg... ggg!

[msg MSG_013 [Aigis]]
It appears to be trying very hard to[n]express its thanks.
It says, "Thank you for saving me."

[msg MSG_014 [Ken]]
So that's what it was saying. *chuckle*[n]Well, I'm glad it's happy!

[msg MSG_015 [Koromaru]]
Arf, arf!

[msg MSG_016 [Broken robot]]
Ggg... gg...

[msg MSG_017 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_018 [Broken robot]]
Ggg... gggg... gg!

[msg MSG_019 [Junpei]]
Hmm, I see... A conversation between a[n]dog and a robot...
Any idea what the heck they're sayin'?[n]Ai-chan, mind translatin' for us?

[msg MSG_020 [Aigis]]
Koromaru-san says, "Everyone here worked[n]together to save you."
The robot says "I am jealous of all the[n]wonderful friends you have."

[sel SEL_021 top]
I'm proud of them.
You can make friends too.

[msg MSG_022 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hehe, I'm glad! You can have friends[n]like this too, you know?

[msg MSG_023 [Futaba]]
Yeah! This world's gonna keep on[n]changin'!
And then you'll get to make a whole[n]buncha friends! You better be ready!

[msg MSG_024 [Futaba]]
You said it, Joker! This world's gonna[n]keep on changin' too.
And then you'll get to make a whole[n]buncha friends! You better be ready!

[msg MSG_025 [Broken robot]]
Ggg... gg... Thank... you...

[msg MSG_026 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Huh!? Did it break again?

[msg MSG_027 [Aigis]]
It seems to have run out of power.
This unit runs on solar energy, so it[n]will recharge if we leave it alone.
I believe its systems are recovered for[n]the most part.

[msg MSG_028 [P3 Fem Protag]]
That scared me for a second... But it[n]sounds like it's gonna be okay now!

[msg MSG_029 [Fuuka]]
I'm surprised there's a robot here with[n]such unique functions.
When we first came here, it was nothing[n]but Ribbon-chan and those identical[n]ones...

[msg MSG_030 [Naoto]]
Perhaps this is another result from[n]righting the wrongs in this film.

[msg MSG_031 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_032 [Aigis]]
It seems our objective is complete.[n]Shall we return to the theater?

[msg MSG_033 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Yeah, good idea. Let's get back to[n]Elizabeth.
