It is good to see you are all well.
You hunted down your prey then closed in[n]for the kill! It seems you were the real[n]bloodthirsty beasts in this story.
What a splendid show. It was a perfect[n]display of the harsh laws of nature.

[msg MSG_001 [Yukari]]
Ahaha... She called us beasts...

[msg MSG_002 [Akihiko]]
I'd never say no to a tough opponent.[n]Lookin' forward to the next one.

[msg MSG_003 [Shinjiro]]
*sigh* The only bloodthirsty one here is[n]you.

[msg MSG_004 [Akechi]]
Well then, I think I'll take a break,.

[msg MSG_005 [Akechi]]
Phew...

[msg MSG_006 [Ken]]
Um, Akechi-san.

[msg MSG_007 [Akechi]]
Amada-kun? What is it?

[msg MSG_008 [Ken]]
Um...
You're different from the rest of the[n]Phantom Thieves, aren't you?

[msg MSG_009 [Akechi]]
......?

[msg MSG_010 [Ken]]
I noticed your expression changes when[n]you're with Koromaru...
I feel at ease when I'm with him too.
It got me thinking that... maybe we're[n]the same, Akechi-san.

[msg MSG_011 [Akechi]]
Hmm... What makes you say that?

[msg MSG_012 [Ken]]
Koromaru's a smart dog, so he can pick[n]up on that kind of stuff.
He was really worried about you, so that[n]must mean you...

[msg MSG_013 [Akechi]]
......

[msg MSG_014 [Ken]]
Uh, sorry... You probably have no idea[n]what I'm talking about.

[msg MSG_015 [Koromaru]]
Arf, arf!

[msg MSG_016 [Ken]]
He's calling for me, so I gotta go.[n]Sorry, just forget I said anything!

[msg MSG_017 [Akechi]]
......
You really are sharp, Koromaru-kun...

[msg MSG_018 [P4 Hero]]
That's an unexpected pair.
It looked like a pretty serious[n]discussion. What do you think they were[n]talking about?

[sel SEL_019 top]
Personal problems?
Love, maybe?
Don't know, don't care.

[msg MSG_020 [P4 Hero]]
I see. Akechi-san does seem like he'd[n]offer good advice.

[msg MSG_021 [P4 Hero]]
What!? But Ken's still in grade[n]school...
Well... he is mature for his age, so[n]it's possible. I imagine Akechi-san[n]would know a lot about those things.

[msg MSG_022 [P4 Hero]]
Yeah. It's probably best not to pry.

[msg MSG_023 [P4 Hero]]
......
This is just a thought, but...
It seems like they each have something[n]looming over them that neither feels[n]they can really talk about.
And whatever those somethings are,[n]they'll eventually lead to...

[sel SEL_024 top]
What do you mean?
I don't follow.

[msg MSG_025 [P4 Hero]]
Oh, sorry. I guess there's no point in[n]wondering.
For now, we'll just have to watch over[n]them...
Hopefully, we'll grow closer as a team[n]and have some sort of positive influence[n]on those two.
