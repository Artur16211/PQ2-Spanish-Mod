The special screening this time is an[n]exploration of A.I.G.I.S.
This time, the designated floor is[n]absolutely chock-full of treasure!
And so, your glorious mission this time[n]is to gather all the filthy lucre you[n]can find.

[msg MSG_001 [Morgana]]
Hehehe... Treasure, huh? You got my[n]attention!

[msg MSG_002 [Ryuji]]
Don't get too excited, you friggin' cat.[n]We just gotta raid Treasure Spots,[n]right?

[msg MSG_003 [Elizabeth]]
Unfortunately, it won't be that easy.
Along with these new Treasure Spots,[n]there are new warping points, as well.
You will find the treasure past these[n]new warp zones.

[msg MSG_004 [Junpei]]
Ugh... Warp zones are gonna throw us[n]everywhere? That's gonna mess up my Ace[n]Perspective...

[msg MSG_005 [Ryuji]]
*sigh* Dammit. It'd be a lot simpler if[n]we could just beat up a tough monster[n]and get the goods.

[sel SEL_006 top]
Stop complaining.
No kidding.

[msg MSG_007 [Haru]]
*giggle* I must say, I agree. These[n]screenings have their own charm, too.
Certainly, flashy action movies are[n]exciting, but not when they're all an[n]audience can watch.

[msg MSG_008 [Haru]]
Oh? Not your type of movie? I myself[n]think these have a certain charm.
Certainly, flashy action movies are[n]exciting, but not when they're all an[n]audience can watch.

[msg MSG_009 [Ryuji]]
Huh? Wait, what audience?

[msg MSG_010 [Mitsuru]]
Hah. A fair point.
Any movie can be a magnificent one...[n]All first-class actors know this to be[n]true.

[msg MSG_011 [Junpei]]
Huh!? Well, I'm a first-class actor[n]myself! I could've told ya that!
Then let's give this a shot! Stars don't[n]get to choose their jobs!

[msg MSG_012 [Ryuji]]
Man... All right, fine, let's get this[n]show on the road.
There's gotta be Shadows out there, so[n]let's kick their asses, get the loot,[n]and make us some new weapons.

[msg MSG_013 [Haru]]
I knew you'd come around! Let's use this[n]chance to make ourselves more powerful!

[msg MSG_014 [Mitsuru]]
Having protectors like you around does[n]much to ease our minds. Now we can[n]gather treasure in peace.
We're counting on the two of you.

[msg MSG_015 [Junpei]]
Heheh, you got it!

[msg MSG_016 [Ryuji]]
Haha... Well, she got us good. Guess we[n]can't win, huh?

[msg MSG_017 [Shinjiro]]
Geez. It's like they got brainwashed.[n]Still, I kind of admire that...
Heh. Well if you're gonna be a leader,[n]maybe you can learn a thing or two.

[msg MSG_018 [Mitsuru]]
The floor layout's probably going to[n]change... We'll have to investigate.

[msg MSG_019 [Haru]]
Then once we're ready, let's set off.[n]Hopefully we'll find something worth the[n]trouble!
