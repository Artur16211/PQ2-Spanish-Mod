Oh? You've all come at the perfect time.
It just so happens that there was a[n]request to view a certain special[n]screening.
The ticket has already been registered[n]at the box office. Please take a look.

[sel SEL_001 top]
A request?
From who?

[msg MSG_002 [Elizabeth]]
Yes, I was having my ear incessantly[n]talked off by none other than...

[msg MSG_003 [Cocky voice]]
*snicker* It wasn't that much trouble,[n]was it?

[msg MSG_004 [Calm voice]]
Yes, I believe that was safely within[n]our rights.

[msg MSG_005 [Elizabeth]]
Well...

[msg MSG_006 [Cocky voice]]
*snicker* It was from us.

[msg MSG_007 [Calm voice]]
And you shall fulfill said request as we[n]desire.

[msg MSG_008 [Futaba]]
Whoa! Where'd the look-alikes come[n]from!?
What's up? Were you two lonely all by[n]yourselves?

[msg MSG_009 [Justine]]
Hardly... We've merely come to pass our[n]orders on to you.

[msg MSG_010 [Caroline]]
Yeah. If we let things keep going as[n]they have, all of your movies are gonna[n]turn out soft.
We figured we would arrange some trials[n]to help with your rehabilitation.

[msg MSG_011 [Elizabeth]]
Your goal in this special screening of[n]theirs...
...Is to defeat the Seidoptera residing[n]in Junessic Land.

[msg MSG_012 [P4 Hero]]
That FOE, huh? This'll be tough.

[msg MSG_013 [Chie]]
It should be a good fight, though,[n]considering how strong we are now!

[msg MSG_014 [Ryuji]]
We've gotten pretty comfortable with[n]this place too. Shouldn't be that hard,[n]what with our bigger team and all.

[msg MSG_015 [Justine]]
...Perhaps. However, there are two FOEs.[n]You must defeat them both.

[msg MSG_016 [P4 Hero]]
Two?

[msg MSG_017 [Caroline]]
*snicker* Scared yet?
It wouldn't be any fun to watch you[n]breeze through it.

[msg MSG_018 [Justine]]
Now, let the special screening begin.[n]Hurry up and entertain us.

[sel SEL_019 top]
Guess we'll give it a try.
We didn't say yes.

[msg MSG_020 [Caroline]]
Well said! Now, get out there and take[n]them down!

[msg MSG_021 [Justine]]
That is a good mindset. Perhaps we can[n]raise our expectations somewhat.

[msg MSG_022 [Justine]]
Do you plan to run away, Inmate? This[n]trial is for your own sake as well.

[msg MSG_023 [Caroline]]
Yeah, if you can't even manage this,[n]then you can forget about succeeding in[n]your rehabilitation.

[msg MSG_024 [Makoto]]
They've got a point. Fighting strong[n]opponents might serve as good[n]experience.

[msg MSG_025 [Ann]]
Hmm... They have helped us a lot. Maybe[n]we should hear them out?

[msg MSG_026 [Elizabeth]]
It seems you've reached a decision.
Raise the curtains. This brawl's about[n]to begin!

[msg MSG_027 [Justine]]
As the stars of this showing, it is your[n]duty to perform the utmost of your[n]abilities.

[msg MSG_028 [Caroline]]
We'll be watching from here. No missteps[n]allowed, Inmate!
