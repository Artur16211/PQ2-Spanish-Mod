Looks like it's a dead end.

[msg MSG_001 [Ann]]
Can we take a break? It's so hot here,[n]and I'm so thirsty.

[msg MSG_002 [Akechi]]
Well, it's no wonder it's hot. This[n]place was specially designed for[n]dinosaurs, after all.

[msg MSG_003 [Yukiko]]
Are you okay, Mona? Maybe you should[n]take that off?

[msg MSG_004 [Morgana]]
It's not a costume!

[msg MSG_005 [Kanji]]

[msg MSG_006]
......?
Kanji's staring at Morgana...

[msg MSG_007 [Ryuji]]
Heeey! Joker!

[msg MSG_008 [Kanji]]
......!

[msg MSG_009 [Ryuji]]
Wassup with him?
He was starin' at Mona, wasn't he...?

[msg MSG_010 [Morgana]]
What's up, Skull?

[msg MSG_011 [Ryuji]]
Uhh, it's nothing.
That's enough restin' for now. Let's[n]roll.

[msg MSG_012 [Kanji]]
......

[msg MSG_013 [Ryuji]]
He's still eyein' him. What's his deal?

[msg MSG_014 [Morgana]]
Hey, Skull! You're gonna fall behind!

[msg MSG_015 [Ryuji]]
My bad! Be right there.

[msg MSG_016]
A new special screening: "Clash of the[n]Thugs" has been added to the box office.
