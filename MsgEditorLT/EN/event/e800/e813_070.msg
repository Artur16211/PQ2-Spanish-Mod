[msg MSG_000 [Naoto]]
Here, this must be what Theodore found.

[msg MSG_001 [Teddie]]
Oho? Let's see... *sniff* *sniff*
...Hrrrm?

[msg MSG_002 [Naoto]]
What's the matter?

[msg MSG_003 [Teddie]]
How bear-y strange... It doesn't have[n]any of that tantalizingly charged smell[n]from before.

[msg MSG_004 [Yusuke]]
What!?
Let me see... *sniff*
You're right... It's not there―the smell[n]that shot straight through my nose and[n]into my head!

[msg MSG_005 [Ryuji]]
What are you, a dog?
But this is definitely what we came here[n]for, right? What else can we do...?

[msg MSG_006 [Yukiko]]
Oh, that's right. Theodore said he used[n]a "certain something" to give the final[n]product its charge.

[msg MSG_007 [Naoto]]
I see... Culinary techniques like dry[n]roasting can be used to strengthen the[n]flavor of nuts and seeds.
Perhaps the same must be done here...

[msg MSG_008 [Yukiko]]
Should I burn it, then? That might bring[n]out the smell.

[msg MSG_009 [Yusuke]]
No, we don't want the smell of[n]charcoal...
It needs to be more... unique―almost[n]electrifying.

[msg MSG_010 [Akechi]]
An electrifying flavor... What would you[n]have to do to get something like that?

[sel SEL_011 top]
Crush it.
Freeze it.
Actually electrify it?

[msg MSG_012 [Naoto]]
True. Crushing pepper is the way to[n]bring out its flavor.
But will that give us the electrifying[n]property we need?

[msg MSG_013 [Haru]]
...What if we actually electrify it?

[msg MSG_014 [Naoto]]
I don't think freezing it will give us[n]the electrifying property that we need.

[msg MSG_015 [Haru]]
...What if we actually electrify it?

[msg MSG_016 [Yosuke]]
Using electricity to get an electrifying[n]taste? No way it's that simple...

[msg MSG_017 [Yusuke]]
That's it! The first time I ate that[n]popcorn, that was the effect I felt!

[msg MSG_018 [Yosuke]]
Are you kidding me...?

[msg MSG_019 [Akechi]]
Theodore did say he used a "certain[n]something" to give it its charge, so[n]it's possible.

[msg MSG_020 [Kanji]]
Time for me to step in?

[msg MSG_021 [Naoto]]
No. We can't be sure of the power level,[n]or should I say charge level, we need.
We only have a limited supply of[n]kernels. We can't just burn them all...

[msg MSG_022 [Futaba]]
Theodore did mention using a "certain[n]something," like he was really clever[n]for figuring it out...

[msg MSG_023 [Akechi]]
I see...
Have you any idea of what that "certain[n]something" might be?

[sel SEL_024 top]
A Persona.
A lightning bolt.
An electric gate.

[msg MSG_025 [Yosuke]]
We already ruled that out, didn't we?

[msg MSG_026 [Akechi]]
It's likely something that produces an[n]electric shock but isn't typically used[n]for cooking. It must be...

[msg MSG_027 [Naoto]]
One of the electrified gates here.

[msg MSG_028 [Morgana]]
How would he know where lightning is[n]going to strike?

[msg MSG_029 [Akechi]]
It's likely something that produces an[n]electric shock but isn't typically used[n]for cooking. It must be...

[msg MSG_030 [Naoto]]
One of the electrified gates here.

[msg MSG_031 [Akechi]]
You're right. That would certainly[n]produce an electric shock.

[msg MSG_032 [Morgana]]
Well, we won't know until we try. Let's[n]go find one of those gates.
