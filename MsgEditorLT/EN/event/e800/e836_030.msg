Good job, everyone! That's the first[n]one!

[msg MSG_001 [Junpei]]
All right! We just need two more, right?
But this is gonna power up our[n]navigators, huh? Wonder what powers[n]they'll get?

[msg MSG_002 [Akihiko]]
Hm... Maybe something like Auto-Protein?[n]It can automatically give us a boost of[n]protein!

[msg MSG_003 [Ken]]
Well... I'd like something cooler. Maybe[n]they'll be able to generate beam sabers[n]for us!

[msg MSG_004 [Futaba]]
Sorry to break it to you, guys, but beam[n]sabers aren't in the cards. Or protein,[n]either.

[msg MSG_005 [Akihiko]]
Bah, figures...

[msg MSG_006 [Ken]]
O-Of course not...

[msg MSG_007 [Fuuka]]
We're looking to increase our speed and[n]our information streaming so we can work[n]even better as a group.
I think I should be able to hack[n]something like that together... I'm sure[n]it'll help!

[msg MSG_008 [Yosuke]]
You say that like it's easy, but the[n]fact that you can just invent new tech[n]like that is amazing...

[msg MSG_009 [Rise]]
I know, right? It's crazy what Oracle[n]and Fuuka-chan can do with all this[n]engineering stuff!
They're our navigator dream team! They[n]can do anything!

[msg MSG_010 [Fuuka]]
O-Oh, I don't know... Your navigation[n]skills are just as good as ours.

[msg MSG_011 [Futaba]]
Yeah! She's accurate, she keeps things[n]simple, and hello, she's an IDOL! Who[n]wouldn't love having her around?

[msg MSG_012 [P4 Hero]]
Each navigator is different and unique.
But there's one thing they all have, and[n]that's incredible skill. That's why we[n]can explore without worrying.

[msg MSG_013 [Rise]]
Eheheh... Well, when Senpai says it like[n]that...!
But this'll help us power up even more![n]So be ready, okay?

[msg MSG_014 [Fuuka]]
Do your best to find the last two[n]pieces, everyone!
