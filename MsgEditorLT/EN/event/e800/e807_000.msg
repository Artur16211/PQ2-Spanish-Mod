...Man, no matter how far we go, it's[n]just the same thing over and over.
Plants and giant bugs as far as the eye[n]can see. And dinosaurs too? This place[n]is crazy...

[msg MSG_001 [Naoto]]
Naturally, the roads aren't paved[n]either, making it difficult to get[n]around...

[msg MSG_002 [Kanji]]
Well, least one of us is doin' fine.

[msg MSG_003 [Yusuke]]
Ahh, what exquisite plant life! A[n]mountain of sketchbooks wouldn't be[n]enough to capture all of this beauty!

[msg MSG_004 [Ann]]
Oh, yeah, don't worry about him.

[msg MSG_005 [Yosuke]]
Sheesh, he's really into this... He's[n]not gonna wander off and get eaten, is[n]he?

[msg MSG_006 [Morgana]]
Honestly, Fox is more likely to eat one[n]of the dinosaurs...

[msg MSG_007 [Yosuke]]
What the hell!? That's something I'd[n]expect from Chie!

[msg MSG_008 [Chie]]
Hey! Even my appetite wouldn't make me[n]just grab a dinosaur and start chomping[n]away!
...Not that I'm opposed to trying[n]dinosaur or anything. No meat is bad[n]meat!

[msg MSG_009 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hmm... dinosaur meat aside, I wonder[n]when we'll be able to eat meat again.

[sel SEL_010 top]
There's hot dogs at the theater.
I feel like I saw some earlier...
Just have to make do with water.

[msg MSG_011 [Chie]]
I mean, hot dogs are great and all, but[n]dinosaur meat's got more... BAM, you[n]know?
I wanna chow down on a chunk of meat so[n]massive, I'll feel like I'll never be[n]able to finish it!

[msg MSG_012 [Chie]]
Wait, really!? Where!?

[msg MSG_013 [Ryuji]]
Yeah, I think I did too. Where was[n]it...?

[msg MSG_014 [Chie]]
Aww... Water...
I know I'm complaining, but water just[n]doesn't do it for me, not in the[n]slightest.

[msg MSG_015 [Yusuke]]
So, where do we find this massive chunk[n]of meat?

[msg MSG_016 [Ryuji]]
That's what we're sayin'. It's not[n]here...
Wait, whoa! The hell'd you come from!?

[msg MSG_017 [Yusuke]]
I heard someone mention meat. My stomach[n]is ready.

[msg MSG_018 [Yosuke]]
This guy's just as weird as Chie...
Look, sorry to disappoint you, but we're[n]probably not gonna be eatin' any meat[n]for a while.

[msg MSG_019 [Yusuke]]
Then... there's... no meat?
And here I was ready to feast... Now I'm[n]even hungrier...

[msg MSG_020 [Chie]]
Yeah, all this talk about meat's made me[n]hungry too...

[msg MSG_021 [Morgana]]
*sigh* A couple of carnivores, these[n]two.
Let's treat them to some meat next time[n]we get a chance, Joker.

[msg MSG_022]
A new special screening: "Meat ï¼† the Art[n]of Friendship" has been added to the box[n]office.
