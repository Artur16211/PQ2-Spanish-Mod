Things turned out rather differently[n]than I had envisioned... Nonetheless, I[n]see you've fulfilled your objective.
I must say, though... I have a mild[n]interest in this girl talk myself.
Someday, I would like to host girl talk[n]between the residents of the Velvet[n]Room.
When that time comes, Theo shall be[n]included as Theoko... or perhaps[n]Theobeth.

[msg MSG_001 [Haru]]
Ahaha... Will Theodore end up like[n]Teddie, then?

[msg MSG_002 [Teddie]]
Nuh-uh-uh. You can't mimic such[n]prettiness so easily.

[msg MSG_003 [Chie]]
So, why exactly do you wanna join in on[n]the girl talk so much, Teddie?

[msg MSG_004 [Teddie]]
Well... Everyone always looks like[n]they're having so much fun.
I thought, if I joined, I'd be able to[n]learn more about you guys. And not only[n]that...
But I thought maybe we'd become better[n]friends too.

[msg MSG_005 [Yukiko]]
Teddie...

[msg MSG_006 [Rise]]
Aww, you should've just said so.

[msg MSG_007 [Haru]]
Yeah. If that's the case, then it[n]doesn't have to just be us girls. We[n]could all chat together.

[msg MSG_008 [Teddie]]
Really!? You're gonna let me join!?
I can come into your secret girl's[n]paradise and talk about this and that?

[msg MSG_009 [Yukiko]]
Sure you can. But if you get any funny[n]ideas, I'll roast you.

[msg MSG_010 [Teddie]]
Eek... But then paradise will roast with[n]me...!
N-No matter! As a member of the beauty[n]brigade, I'm gonna keep giving it all[n]I've got!
Ai-chan, Rise-chan, Haru-chan! Let's[n]steal everyone's hearts together!

[msg MSG_011 [Haru]]
Yeah, let's do it!

[msg MSG_012 [Rise]]
You got it! Just don't think I'm ever[n]gonna let you beat me as far as cuteness[n]is concerned!

[msg MSG_013 [Aigis]]
I shall follow your example and pierce[n]everyone's hearts, Teddie!
