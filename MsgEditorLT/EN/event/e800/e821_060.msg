[msg MSG_000 [Chie]]
Phew... We're finally back... No more[n]carnivores, right?

[msg MSG_001 [Fuuka]]
No, I'm not sensing any around here.[n]Looks like we can fish in peace.

[msg MSG_002 [Fuuka]]
And because we led the FOE away from the[n]area, the fish are still here.
I bet we'll catch a really big one!

[msg MSG_003 [P4 Hero]]
A big one, huh...? Okay, I'm ready.

[msg MSG_004 [Futaba]]
Oh? You're starting to sound like a real[n]hunter.
With this many, I bet we can[n]legitimately grab the fish outta the[n]water! Go! Hunters of the Jungle!

[msg MSG_005]
We decided to work together to catch[n]some fish...
......
We managed to catch a really big one!

[msg MSG_006 [Fuuka]]
However... It looks like our fight with[n]the FOE scared off some of the fish.
Oh, but there's still a few here and[n]there! Good luck, everyone.

[msg MSG_007 [P4 Hero]]
They don't have to be big as long as[n]they're tasty. Let's get to it, guys.

[msg MSG_008]
We decided to work together to catch[n]some fish...
......
We didn't see any big ones, but we still[n]managed to round up a few[n]reasonably-sized fish!

[msg MSG_009 [Chie]]
We got the fish we wanted AND defeated[n]the FOE! Three cheers for everyone!

[msg MSG_010 [Shinjiro]]
This'll be enough. Between the fish and[n]the herbs, we should be able to make[n]something decent.

[msg MSG_011 [Ann]]
Well, we have the ingredients and the[n]cookware. The only thing left to do is[n]cook.
Now I'm getting hungry too. I wonder[n]what he's gonna make!

[msg MSG_012 [P3 Fem Protag]]
*chuckle* You know it'll be good if it's[n]Shinjiro-senpai's cooking!
Not only will it fill your stomach, but[n]it'll also make you feel all fuzzy[n]inside!

[msg MSG_013 [Shinjiro]]
Huh...? Don't say shit like that...

[msg MSG_014 [Junpei]]
Ohh? Are you blushing, Shinjiro-san?

[msg MSG_015 [Shinjiro]]
You wanna eat these raw, Junpei?

[msg MSG_016 [Junpei]]
C-C'mon, I was just joking! Sheesh...[n]Can't you take a joke?

[msg MSG_017 [Yusuke]]
This is it for me... I'm losing[n]consciousness...

[msg MSG_018 [Futaba]]
Oh, whoops, I forgot about Fox.

[msg MSG_018_02 [Futaba]]
Oh, whoops, I forgot about Fox.

[msg MSG_019 [Yusuke]]
Ngh...! You bastard. How cowardly of you[n]to ambush us wearing that lobster shell!
I will not lose to a crustacean...[n]Zzz...

[msg MSG_020 [Futaba]]
Hm. Looks like he's ready to eat too.

[msg MSG_021 [Shinjiro]]
Psh... Jus' give me a sec, and I'll cook[n]somethin' up.

[msg MSG_022 [Shinjiro]]
...Here, it's done. Eat it before it[n]gets cold.

[msg MSG_023 [Yusuke]]
Oh... Ohhh!

[msg MSG_024 [Chie]]
Whoa! It smells just as good as it[n]looks!

[msg MSG_025 [Yusuke]]
I-It's delicious!
The mixture of the herbs and the sauce[n]from the fish...! It's positively[n]mouthwatering!
Food is truly one of life's great[n]joysâ€•an art in and of itself!

[msg MSG_026 [Yosuke]]
I can't stop drooling. Where's ours?

[msg MSG_027 [Shinjiro]]
Don't worry, there's enough for[n]everyone, but you gotta wait your turn.
This is yours, Koromaru. I put some[n]aside just for you.
It's hot. Don't burn your tongue.

[msg MSG_028 [Koromaru]]
Woof! Woof!

[msg MSG_029 [P3 Fem Protag]]
*huff* *huff* It'f foooooo gooof!
I just knew it would be good,[n]Shinjiro-senpai! Oh, I'm so happy right[n]now!

[msg MSG_030 [Chie]]
Man, it's like my chopsticks have a mind[n]of their own! Seconds, please!

[msg MSG_031 [Morgana]]
Meow[f 0 1 1]! Shinjiro! I want some more too!

[msg MSG_032 [Shinjiro]]
All right! Calm down!

[msg MSG_033]
We enjoyed eating with everyone...

[msg MSG_034 [Yusuke]]
*sigh* I feel so alive.
Sanada-san, Aragaki-san... I can't thank[n]you enough. This was an amazing[n]experience.

[msg MSG_035 [Akihiko]]
You're putting too much praise on the[n]food. It's Shinji you should be[n]thanking.

[msg MSG_036 [Yusuke]]
Right. It was delicious. I thank you[n]both for allowing me to eat.
However, that's not all I wish to be[n]thankful for. The two of you also[n]reminded me of something important.

[msg MSG_037 [Akihiko]]
What's that?

[msg MSG_038 [Yusuke]]
Eating is more than just a way to[n]satisfy one's hunger.
It brings everyone together, and in[n]doing so, satisfies one's heart.
......
This experience reminded me of the times[n]I would sit around the table with my[n]fellow apprentices.

[sel SEL_039 top]
They must've been memorable.
Do you feel lonely?
Let's do it again sometime.

[msg MSG_040 [Yusuke]]
Indeed. It was so long ago, I'd nearly[n]forgotten... I'm glad I was able to[n]recall this feeling.

[msg MSG_041 [Yusuke]]
No, I have all of you now.

[msg MSG_042 [Yusuke]]
Absolutely. Just say the word, and I'll[n]be there.

[msg MSG_043 [Akihiko]]
Heh... It's almost like we're family.
We've had times like this too, huh,[n]Shinji?

[msg MSG_044 [Shinjiro]]
Hmph, can't say I remember...

[msg MSG_045 [Akihiko]]
Psh... You might not remember, but I[n]definitely do.

[msg MSG_046 [Shinjiro]]
That right? Good for you.

[msg MSG_047 [Akihiko]]
I gotta say thanks as well, Fox.
Thanks to you, I was able to eat[n]Shinji's cooking for the first time in[n]what feels like forever.
If there's anything you ever need help[n]with, just let me know.

[msg MSG_048 [Yusuke]]
Thank you. The same goes for you.
Furthermore... I've a few more words of[n]appreciation I'd like to give.

[msg MSG_049 [Shinjiro]]
Yeah? What's up...?

[msg MSG_050 [Yusuke]]
Seconds, please!

[msg MSG_051 [Akihiko]]
Heh... I admire that stomach of yours,[n]Fox!
I'm not about to let myself get showed[n]up here. Hey, Shinji, I want seconds[n]too!

[msg MSG_052 [Shinjiro]]
Great... Now I've got two of 'em to deal[n]with.
