Good job, everyone. I'm so glad we were[n]able to succeed together!

Whew... That sure was a long walk, but[n]I'm feeling almost refreshed.
I think everyone got to see me in[n]action... Yep, this movie's gonna be a[n]timeless classic.

[msg MSG_003 [Mitsuru]]
*chuckle* You did well indeed. If only[n]you had such a work ethic all the time.

[msg MSG_004 [Ryuji]]
Well, it was fun. I guess these kinda[n]screenings ain't so bad.

[msg MSG_005 [Morgana]]
Hey, I put in work too! If you need a[n]treasure hunter, I'm your guy!

[msg MSG_006 [Haru]]
*giggle* I hope we get to do more of[n]these sorts of missions.
Now, let's go back and report to[n]Elizabeth.
