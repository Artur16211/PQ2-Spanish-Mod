There it is! Let's get in there and land[n]the first strike!

[msg MSG_001 [Chie]]
Roger that! I'm ready to learn from the[n]best!
...Wait, there's no road!?

[msg MSG_002 [Akihiko]]
Whoa!

[msg MSG_003 [Makoto]]
Calm down, you two. First, we need to[n]assess the situation.
See the enemy's orientation. Gauge its[n]speed, movements, and position. Observe,[n]then predict its actions.
After that, you can decide the best way[n]to respond.

[msg MSG_004 [Akihiko]]
I see.

...They're totally frozen. Guess they[n]can't think of anything.

[msg MSG_007 [Makoto]]
*sigh* In any case, our attacks won't[n]reach it from here.
We'll have to look for a way around,[n]first.

[msg MSG_008 [Chie]]
Got it, Coach!

[msg MSG_009 [Akihiko]]
Let's go, Chie! I'll race you!

[msg MSG_010 [Makoto]]
Well, at least they're quick on their[n]feet...
All right. We should go too.
