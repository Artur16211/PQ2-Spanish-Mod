This special screening will require you[n]to hunt down a specific number of[n]targets.
Though you could also resort to[n]eliminating anything and everything that[n]comes your way...

...There you have it, a sure candidate[n]for the feel-good movie of the year.
Your targets this time are the Rampage[n]Drives found in "A.I.G.I.S."
I want you to defeat four of them.

Right! It's all about making the first[n]move!

[msg MSG_003 [Akihiko]]
I like your attitude, [f 6 1 27 0 0 0]! Let's[n]knock 'em dead!

[msg MSG_004 [Shinjiro]]
You guys better not just jump into this[n]without a plan.

[msg MSG_005 [Elizabeth]]
I'll mark the locations of these Shadows[n]on your map.
Best of luck, everyone.
