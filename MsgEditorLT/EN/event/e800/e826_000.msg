Bark! Bark, bark!

[msg MSG_001 [Kanji]]
Whoa! What're you doin', Koro!? Don't[n]bark at me like that!

[msg MSG_002 [Koromaru]]
Grrr...

[msg MSG_003 [Aigis]]
Koromaru-san appears to be saying:[n]"Don't stand behind me."

[sel SEL_004 top]
Badass.
Are you a hitman!?

[msg MSG_005 [Yosuke]]
He sounds just like that sniper from[n]that one manga series...

[msg MSG_006 [Yosuke]]
Nothing gets past you does it,...?

[msg MSG_007 [Ann]]
Here, Koro-chan. It's okay.

[msg MSG_008 [Koromaru]]
*whine*

[msg MSG_009 [Kanji]]
The hell!? Why does Ann-san get to pet[n]him...!?

[msg MSG_010 [Ann]]
Good boy, Koro-chan. You're like our own[n]little mascot.

[msg MSG_011 [Teddie]]
What about me!? I make a pretty good[n]mascot myself!
So feel free to pet me too, Ann-chan.

[msg MSG_012 [Ann]]
H-Hey, uh...!
Actually, you are pretty soft...

[msg MSG_013 [Teddie]]
Ahhh... This is the life...

[msg MSG_014 [Morgana]]
Hey, you two fuzzballs! What do you[n]think you're doing!?
Lady Ann, how could you pet those two[n]when you've got me...?

[msg MSG_015 [Ann]]
Haha, I'm sorry. I thought you didn't[n]like it when I treated you like an[n]animal.

[msg MSG_016 [Teddie]]
You can pet me aaallllll you want. There[n]you go[f 0 1 1]

[msg MSG_017 [Koromaru]]
Bark, bark!

[msg MSG_018 [Morgana]]
Grrrr... I'm no mascot... But...

[sel SEL_019 top]
You'll lose at this rate.
Gonna swallow your pride?

[msg MSG_020 [Morgana]]
I know... But I'm still a phantom thief.
I can't stoop to that level...

[msg MSG_021 [Morgana]]
No... I have to remember I'm a phantom[n]thief.
I can't stoop to the level of some[n]mascot...

[msg MSG_022 [Rise]]
Yeah, I know how you feel.
Idols can either go for the cute style[n]or the cool style. It's really hard to[n]choose at first.

[msg MSG_023 [Yosuke]]
I don't think it's the same...

[msg MSG_024 [Morgana]]
Never mind! Just get away from Lady Ann,[n]you dirty old bear!

[msg MSG_025 [Teddie]]
Oho, do you hear that? It sounds like a[n]sore loser[f 0 1 1]
Only pretty mascots have the right to be[n]pet by pretty ladies.
And the prettiest mascot of all is...

[sel SEL_026 top]
Morgana.
Koromaru.
Who?

[msg MSG_027 [Morgana]]
M-Me!?
No way, I'm not even a mascot. That[n]said, its definitely not Teddie!

[msg MSG_028 [Koromaru]]
Arf!?

[msg MSG_029 [Morgana]]
I don't agree either, but I'll let it[n]slide.
At the very least, Teddie, it's[n]certainly not you!

[msg MSG_030 [Teddie]]
Obviously, the best possible choice is[n]the one and only Teddie!

[msg MSG_031 [Morgana]]
Heh, said you and no one else. You don't[n]deserve that title one bit!

[msg MSG_032 [Teddie]]
Grrr... So, you refuse to admit it?
Very well, I say we decide who the[n]number one mascot is here and now!

[msg MSG_033 [Mitsuru]]
Hey, what's going on over here?
Don't slack off just because nobody's[n]around.

[msg MSG_034 [Ann]]
Oh, right. Sorry!

[msg MSG_034_1 [Ann]]
See? We got in trouble. Let's all just[n]try to get along, okay?

[msg MSG_035 [Morgana]]
W-Well said, Lady Ann! Love and peace[n]are the way to go!

[msg MSG_036 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_037 [Teddie]]
Hmph, I'll overlook it just this once,[n]but, next time, you won't be so[n]lucky...!

[msg MSG_038 [Yosuke]]
Hey, you talking to yourself, Teddie?[n]Everybody else up and left already.

[msg MSG_039 [Teddie]]
...Huh?

[msg MSG_040]
A new special screening: "Mascot[n]Match-up!" has been added to the box[n]office.
