Whew... We've walked quite a ways.[n]Should we take a break?

[msg MSG_001 [Teddie]]
Yes! Let's all lie down! I get the spot[n]next to Yuka-chan!

[msg MSG_002 [Morgana]]
Well then I get the one next to Lady[n]Ann!

[msg MSG_003 [Kanji]]
Then I'll take Mona...!

[msg MSG_004 [Futaba]]
You're all hoping to get some pets, huh?[n]Kanji, at least the animals have an[n]excuse, for crying out loud.

[sel SEL_006 top]
What's wrong?
You're tired, too?

[msg MSG_007 [Hikari]]
Oh, I'm fine.
I just get a strange feeling here.
It's oddly bright, strange... And scary.
But for some reason, I'm kind of[n]comfortable here.

[sel SEL_008 top]
Well, it's your movie.
It is a nice place.

[msg MSG_009 [Hikari]]
Mm-hm. Maybe this is like my second[n]home...

[msg MSG_010 [Hikari]]
*chuckle* Thank you for complimenting my[n]movie.

[msg MSG_011 [Hikari]]
I wonder if this will always be here...[n]Or if it will change.
......
*chuckle* Sorry for getting lost in my[n]thoughts.
Let's look for that fruit. We don't want[n]to keep Elizabeth waiting.
