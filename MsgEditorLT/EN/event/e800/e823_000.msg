[msg MSG_000 [Mitsuru]]
, it seems you're fitting in quite well[n]with everyone here.

[msg MSG_001 [P3 Fem Protag]]
*chuckle* I almost feel like I'm back[n]home.
It's not hard to get along with everyone[n]when they act just like they always do.

[msg MSG_002 [Akihiko]]
Oh? So there isn't much difference[n]between us here and us in your world?

[msg MSG_003 [P3 Fem Protag]]
That's right! Mitsuru-senpai is always[n]super mature and reliable.
Shinjiro-senpai is always very kind and[n]often sneaks off to pet Koromaru and[n]make him food.

[msg MSG_004 [Shinjiro]]
Huh...!?

[msg MSG_005 [P3 Fem Protag]]
And whenever I try to hang out with[n]Akihiko-senpai, it always turns into[n]some kind of training routine...
So I end up jogging back to the dorm,[n]drenched in sweat.

[msg MSG_006 [Shinjiro]]
*sigh* Damn, Aki, you're a pain in the[n]ass in that world too...

[msg MSG_007 [Akihiko]]
Who're you calling a pain in the ass!?[n]It's important that you train daily.
I'm sure the other me is only doing it[n]because he cares about you,.

[msg MSG_008 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Huh? Sure... Ahaha...

[msg MSG_009 [Akihiko]]
If you can keep up with my routine, then[n]you're in good shape.
All right, then, maybe we should go work[n]out later. We're gonna get weak if we[n]slack off too much.

[msg MSG_010 [Shinjiro]]
This is what I'm talkin' about. You[n]don't need to listen to what Aki says if[n]you don't want to.

[msg MSG_011 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Oh, no! It's not that I don't want to!
I was feeling the urge to move around[n]anyway!

[msg MSG_012 [Akihiko]]
See? You hear that?

[msg MSG_013 [Shinjiro]]
Tch... If you leave the routine up to[n]Aki, who knows what you'll end up doing.
...Hey. If you plan on trainin', let me[n]know.

[msg MSG_014 [Akihiko]]
Are you finally gonna work out with me,[n]Shinji!?
Heh, all right... I'll come up with an[n]awesome routine!

[msg MSG_015 [Shinjiro]]
That's not what I'm sayin', dumbass.

[msg MSG_016 [Mitsuru]]
Ugh... Frankly, I'd be too concerned to[n]leave [f 6 1 26 0 0 0] with just the two of you.
Both of you better control your tempers.[n]Understood?
