The targets have been eliminated.
A fierce battle against mighty[n]tyrants... You may very well have made[n]film history.
Ah, there are few things more enjoyable[n]than rooting for my team with a mouth[n]full of popcorn.

[msg MSG_001 [Junpei]]
Glad she's having fun...

[msg MSG_002 [Elizabeth]]
Here is your reward for this time.
This will allow you to summon the[n]Persona "Fenrir."
Hopefully, you will put it to good use.

[msg MSG_003 [Morgana]]
All right, this'll help a lot!

[msg MSG_004 [Yosuke]]
I think the MVPs this time were Ken and[n]Futaba-chan.
Those were some crazy-tough opponents,[n]but they kept us going.

[msg MSG_005 [Rise]]
Haha, yeah. They were super motivating.
Weren't you afraid, though, Ken-kun?[n]Those Tyranniqueens were huge.

[msg MSG_006 [Ken]]
Haha, it'll take more than that to scare[n]Featherman.
Besides, I thought maybe I could[n]recreate that famous scene where they[n]fight the giant monster.

[msg MSG_007 [Rise]]
Famous scene?

[msg MSG_008 [Futaba]]
Featherman Season 1, Episode 13! A[n]god-tier episode to this day!
They usually fight as robots when an[n]enemy grows all big...

[msg MSG_009 [Yosuke]]
Oh, yeah. They all come out of their[n]base and connect, right?

[msg MSG_010 [Ken]]
Yeah, but this time the robots were[n]under inspection, and they couldn't use[n]them.

[msg MSG_011 [Yosuke]]
That's a weirdly realistic situation for[n]that show...

[msg MSG_012 [Futaba]]
And what do our heroes do!?
They band together and defeat the[n]monster just like we did!

[msg MSG_013 [Ken]]
With every last ounce of their courage,[n]they run up to its feet and do a special[n]attack!
That scene is great! I would sit there[n]and watch it over and over.
It was so exciting to actually be able[n]to do something like that.

[msg MSG_014 [Ann]]
I... don't really get what's going on,[n]but it definitely sounds cool.

[msg MSG_015 [Futaba]]
If you want, I can lend you the DVD![n]There's a lot more episodes to see!

[sel SEL_016 top]
Maybe next time...
Please do.

[msg MSG_017 [P3 Hero]]
Haha, I'll take you up on that. We can[n]watch it together, Ken.

[msg MSG_018 [P3 Hero]]
Hahaha, are you jumping on the[n]bandwagon, Feather Joker?

[msg MSG_019 [P3 Hero]]
Either way, good job, everyone. I'm[n]counting on you guys.

[msg MSG_020 [Ken]]
Of course!

[msg MSG_021 [Futaba]]
Yeah, leave it to us!

[msg MSG_022 [Kanji]]
H-Hey... You think I can get in on that?
I'll be Yellow, the one that likes[n]curry...

[msg MSG_023 [Futaba]]
Whoa! It's the big skull monster! Back[n]off, you demon!

[msg MSG_024 [Ken]]
Persistent beast, aren't you!? We'll[n]defeat you this time!

[msg MSG_025 [Kanji]]
Grrrahh! I said I wanna be Yellow!
