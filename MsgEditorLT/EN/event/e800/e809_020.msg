So where should we start looking for[n]this new street art?

[msg MSG_001 [Haru]]
I think we've seen graffiti in a number[n]of places already.
See? It's there too.

[msg MSG_002 [Ryuji]]
Actually, seeing this reminds me...
...There was a lot more of it here,[n]here, and here. I think there was some[n]in other places too.

[msg MSG_003 [Yusuke]]
Now that you mention it, I did see an[n]unfinished drawing in a back alley[n]earlier.
If we're looking for a drawing that was[n]changed, I would think that one would be[n]easy to overwrite.

[msg MSG_004 [Makoto]]
Good point. Let's go see.

[msg MSG_005 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Oh! I just remembered!
I saw some unfinished graffiti in a back[n]alley when I was walking around the city[n]by myself.

[msg MSG_006 [Yusuke]]
Unfinished...?

[msg MSG_007 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Yeah. If we're looking for graffiti that[n]was changed, wouldn't something like[n]that be easy to overwrite?

[msg MSG_008 [Yusuke]]
I see. You have a point... Shall we take[n]a look, Joker?

[msg MSG_009 [Morgana]]
A back alley, huh? Okay let's move out,[n]Joker!
