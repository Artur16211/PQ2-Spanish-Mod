First, let's locate the dinosaur. Who[n]knows what'll happen to it if we don't.

[msg MSG_001 [P4 Hero]]
Rise, do you sense it nearby?

[msg MSG_002 [Rise]]
Hmm... One sec.
Oh! I'm getting something small near[n]here!

[msg MSG_003 [Teddie]]
I just hope we don't run into some kinda[n]carnivore...

[msg MSG_004 [Yosuke]]
If that happens, you're the decoy. We'll[n]help the dino.

[msg MSG_005 [Teddie]]
I don't wanna be a bear-ger and fries[n]combo! You're coming with me, Yosuke!

[msg MSG_006 [Yukiko]]
Good point. A dish does need a little[n]something to add colorâ€•like parsley.

[msg MSG_007 [Yosuke]]
So I'm just a garnish...?

[msg MSG_008 [Haru]]
That's a good idea. Not everyone likes[n]the way animals smell either.

[msg MSG_009 [Teddie]]
Are you saying I stink!?

[msg MSG_010 [Haru]]
And if the dinosaur is wounded, we'll[n]need to heal it as well.
I'm not sure if medicine for humans will[n]work, though... It's probably best if we[n]use something else.

[msg MSG_011 [Makoto]]
That's true. Hopefully we can find some[n]herbs somewhere around here...
But, first things first: we need to[n]rescue that dinosaur.

[msg MSG_012 [Haru]]
Let's hurry. I want to reunite it with[n]its mom.

[msg MSG_013 [Yukiko]]
Right, we can't leave it alone. Let's[n]find it ASAP.
