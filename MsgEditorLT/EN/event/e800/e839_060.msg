[msg MSG_000 [Yosuke]]
Yeah! That's what happens when we get[n]serious!

[msg MSG_001 [Junpei]]
Not bad, everyone. But not quite as[n]awesome as me.
Sorry, but that's just the reality of[n]working alongside a SEES ace such as[n]myself. I can't help being MVP.

[msg MSG_002 [Ryuji]]
Nah man, I was the MVP. I was out in[n]front of everyone!

[msg MSG_003 [Yosuke]]
What!? Dude, it was me! Nobody would[n]have had the flowers' hint without me!

[msg MSG_004 [Chie]]
They sure seem chatty over there.

[msg MSG_005 [Yukiko]]
Well, at least they make a good team.

[msg MSG_006 [Junpei]]
Alright then, let's ask [f 6 1 16 0 0], the[n]leader of SEES.
Who did the best this time? Me, myself,[n]or I?

[msg MSG_007 [Ryuji]]
The hell kinda question is that!?

[msg MSG_008 [P3 Hero]]
Haha, I can't answer that. You all did[n]really well.

[msg MSG_009 [P4 Hero]]
He's right. All three of you did great.

[sel SEL_010 top]
You're awesome, Skull.
I'm counting on you.

[msg MSG_011 [Ryuji]]
Oh, uh, thanks... Um, yeah, I'm not used[n]to praise, so I dunno what to say...

[msg MSG_012 [P4 Hero]]
No need to explain. My partner, Yosuke,[n]can't accept praise either. But I too[n]feel unbeatable with him.

[msg MSG_013 [Yosuke]]
Whoa, not you too...
Wait, did you say "unbeatable"? Did[n]you... overhear us talking earlier?

[msg MSG_014 [Junpei]]
Aw, geez. Don't tell me and [f 6 1 16 0 0][n]might've heard, too?

[msg MSG_015 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Yep. We heard every word.
And I'd like to offer you my heartfelt[n]thanks, Junpei.

[msg MSG_016 [Junpei]]
No! I'd rather you make fun of me!

[msg MSG_017 [P3 Hero]]
I thank you as well, Junpei. Let's have[n]a good rivalry.

[msg MSG_018 [Junpei]]
Oh, uh, sure...
Wait, didn't you hear what I just said!?

[msg MSG_019 [Ann]]
Haha, you're so loud that we could hear[n]everything you said, Skull.
Maybe now you'll be quiet when we tell[n]you to be.

[msg MSG_020 [Ryuji]]
Dammit, this is so embarrassing. Even[n]Panther's joined in...
...Argh, I don't got time for this!

[msg MSG_021 [Hikari]]
......

[msg MSG_022 [Ryuji]]
What about leaving behind this mushy[n]stuff and doing our mission? Hikari, did[n]you find what you were looking for?

[msg MSG_023 [Hikari]]
...Yes! This is the thing I sensed.

[msg MSG_024 [Yosuke]]
Hey, you did it! Congrats, Hikari-chan!

[msg MSG_025 [Hikari]]
I couldn't have done it without you all.

[msg MSG_025_2 [Junpei]]
Glad it all worked out. If you ever need[n]a helping hand again, you know where to[n]find me.
I'll come runnin' to Hikari in a[n]hikurry!

[msg MSG_026 [Hikari]]
Uh...

[msg MSG_027 [Yosuke]]
Hikari in a hikurry? That joke's so bad[n]I don't even know what to say...

[msg MSG_028 [Ryuji]]
Man, I almost feel sorry for your buddy,[n][f 6 1 16 0 0]...
