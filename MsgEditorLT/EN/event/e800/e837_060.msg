[msg MSG_000 [Elizabeth]]
Welcome back, everyone. Here is your[n]reward for this special screening.

[msg MSG_001 [Akihiko]]
So I think you got a good idea of how[n]strong we are... You notice anything[n]that needs improvement?

[msg MSG_002 [Chie]]
We're ready for that special training[n]course, Coach!

[msg MSG_003 [Makoto]]
Yes, I wrote down some things I believe[n]you're lacking in.

[msg MSG_004 [Chie]]
Thanks! Let's see...
......

[msg MSG_005 [Akihiko]]
What is this...?

[msg MSG_006 [Chie]]
A menu?

[sel SEL_007 top]
What's going on?
Is this training?
I guess that counts.

[msg MSG_008 [Makoto]]
I'm sure I've said it before. You're[n]both already so strong.
In terms of training, there's not much[n]else I can give you.

[msg MSG_009 [Chie]]
But a whole diet change...? And... it's[n]all fish and vegetables...

[msg MSG_010 [Akihiko]]
There's SOME meat, but the ratio looks[n]pretty small... You sure there's enough[n]protein here?

[msg MSG_011 [Makoto]]
There are plant-based proteins as well[n]as meat-based ones. You need a balance[n]of both.
If you want to get all the necessary[n]nutrients, you can't neglect your[n]vegetables either.
And you want to train your brain as[n]well, right? Then you should be actively[n]eating fish.

[msg MSG_012 [Chie]]
It makes sense, sure, but... there's[n]barely any meat...

[msg MSG_013 [Akihiko]]
No, if this menu will bring us true[n]strength, then...

[msg MSG_014 [Chie]]
...Master!

[msg MSG_015 [Akihiko]]
Thanks, Makoto. We'll use this menu, and[n]become even stronger for it.

[msg MSG_016 [Makoto]]
No, I should be thanking you.
Seeing your devotion to becoming[n]stronger made me think about my own[n]reasons.
Why did I want to become strong?

[sel SEL_017 top]
To fight strong enemies?
To protect someone?

[msg MSG_018 [Makoto]]
That's what Satonaka-san and Sanada-kun[n]said, but...
If you want to be able to stop strong[n]enemies, isn't that because you want to[n]protect someone from them?
Protecting people takes strength... I[n]aspired to that strength myself. I[n]wanted to be just like him.

[msg MSG_019 [Makoto]]
Yes. Exactly.
If you want to be able to stop strong[n]enemies, isn't that because you want to[n]protect someone from them?
Protecting people takes strength... I[n]aspired to that strength myself. I[n]wanted to be just like him.

[msg MSG_020 [Chie]]
You mean your dad, right...? He sounds[n]like a real hero. I bet he protected the[n]people.
Sometimes I wish I could be like the[n]heroes in the movies. Swooping in,[n]saving my friends from danger...
That's why I'm gonna get even stronger!

[msg MSG_021 [Akihiko]]
Yeah. That's why I need to be able to[n]trust my fists... so I never lose anyone[n]important to me again.
If it'll help me do that, I'll go[n]through anything.

[msg MSG_022 [Makoto]]
You guys...

[sel SEL_023 top]
You're all like that.
Don't lose to them.

[msg MSG_024 [Makoto]]
Heh... Maybe so. I guess I should join[n]in their training, huh?

[msg MSG_025 [Makoto]]
I suppose not. Maybe I'd better join in[n]their training, huh?

[msg MSG_026 [Akihiko]]
Of course. We'd be happy to have you. We[n]could get started right now.
Oh, but first, we've gotta eat up.[n]Replenish all the energy we've lost.

[msg MSG_027 [Chie]]
Beeeef boooowl!

[msg MSG_028 [Makoto]]
Hold on a second. What about the menu[n]you were just looking at?

[msg MSG_029 [Akihiko]]
But it says meat is okay once a day. And[n]it's about time I had some.

[msg MSG_030 [Chie]]
Yeah! Don't think, feel!

[msg MSG_031 [Akihiko]]
Truth is, Makoto, I was watching you in[n]that last battle too...
You tend to overthink things a little.[n]Sometimes you need to be able to rely on[n]intuition alone.

[sel SEL_032 top]
Is that her weakness?
That's true.
This is training too.

[msg MSG_033 [Makoto]]
I overthink things...? I guess I can't[n]deny that.

[msg MSG_034 [Chie]]
In other words, this is training for you[n]too, Makoto-san.
The point is, don't think! Feel! Feel[n]the power of BEEF!

[msg MSG_035 [Makoto]]
Wait, what!? Hey!

[msg MSG_036 [Elizabeth]]
...It would seem another new bond has[n]been forged.
And with that, the curtain falls on this[n]screening. Until next time...
