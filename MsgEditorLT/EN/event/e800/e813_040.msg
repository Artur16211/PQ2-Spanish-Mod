We made our way to Theodore's shop...

[msg MSG_000_3 [Theodore]]
Oh...? What brings everyone here?

[msg MSG_000_5 [Naoto]]
Please forgive the sudden intrusion. We[n]just want to ask you a few questions.

[msg MSG_001 [Marie]]
......
What's with the huge crowd?

[msg MSG_002 [Akechi]]
...Have we come at a bad time?

[msg MSG_002_2 [Akechi]]
...Have we come at a bad time?

[msg MSG_003 [Naoto]]
We were curious about your new popcorn[n]recipe.
Have you had a chance to make any more[n]since you gave us that last batch?

[msg MSG_004 [Theodore]]
No, I still haven't restocked the[n]ingredients, so I haven't had the chance[n]to do so...

[msg MSG_005 [Akechi]]
I see. Very well, then.
One more question: why is Marie-san in a[n]bad mood?

[msg MSG_005_2 [Theodore]]
Ahh, well... About that...

[msg MSG_006 [Marie]]
It's Teddie's fault.

[msg MSG_007 [Naoto]]
What!?

[msg MSG_008 [Theodore]]
Actually, Teddie was here just a moment[n]ago...
He very deliberately charged into Marie[n]while she was eating some of my new[n]popcorn.

[sel SEL_009 top]
It's the same as before.
He's targeting the popcorn?

[msg MSG_010 [Akechi]]
Yes, it is rather similar to the[n]previous incident.

[msg MSG_011 [Akechi]]
That seems likely. It's also similar to[n]the previous incident.

[msg MSG_012 [Marie]]
I can't believe he did that to my[n]popcorn...!

[msg MSG_013 [Naoto]]

Around what time did you see Teddie?

[msg MSG_014 [Theodore]]
Not too long ago... It was just a little[n]while before I heard someone scream.
Come to think of it, I did notice[n]something strange.

[msg MSG_015 [Naoto]]
Something strange...?

[msg MSG_016 [Theodore]]
Yes. Teddie's walk was awfully unsteady[n]at the time.
Not only that, but he spoke not a word,[n]even when I called out to him.

[sel SEL_017 top]
That is strange.
Teddie? Silent?

[msg MSG_018 [Naoto]]
Yes, it is very unnatural for Teddie not[n]to respond when spoken to...

[msg MSG_019 [Akechi]]
That does seem unusual. I get the[n]feeling Teddie is...

[msg MSG_020 [Naoto]]
...I believe you and I are thinking the[n]same thing.
The quickest way to find out would be to[n]ask him directly.

[msg MSG_021 [Akechi]]
In that case, shall we return to where[n]we found his suit? He may already be[n]back.

[msg MSG_022 [Naoto]]
I agree. Let's go.
