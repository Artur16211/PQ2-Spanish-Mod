Phew... Thank you for waiting, everyone.
The popcorn is ready now. Please help[n]yourselves.

[msg MSG_001 [Akechi]]
Thank you.
Also, if it's not too much to ask, we'd[n]appreciate it if you kept this new batch[n]a secret.

[msg MSG_002 [Theodore]]
Of course.
I swear on the popcorn, I won't tell a[n]soul. You have my word.

[msg MSG_003 [Naoto]]
Now then, all we have to do is leave[n]Teddie's costume in front of the[n]screening room.

[msg MSG_004 [Akechi]]
Right. Let's put our plan into action.
