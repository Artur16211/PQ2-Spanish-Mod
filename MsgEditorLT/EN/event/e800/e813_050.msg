[msg MSG_000]
Outside the screening room...
Teddie's bear suit is still here.

[msg MSG_001 [Akechi]]
Based on what we know of his behavior,[n]Teddie was after one thing...

[msg MSG_002 [Naoto]]
Right. Theodore's popcorn.

[msg MSG_003 [Akechi]]
But why wouldn't Teddie just ask?
Considering his personality, it's hard[n]to believe he'd act so aggressively.

[msg MSG_004 [Naoto]]
I have a theory on that...

[msg MSG_005 [Teddie]]
Ohh? It's Nao-chan and Goro. What're you[n]doing here?

[msg MSG_006 [Naoto]]
Teddie! We've been looking for you!

[msg MSG_007 [Teddie]]
Hm? Why's everyone look so serious?

[msg MSG_008 [Naoto]]
Well, you see...

[msg MSG_009 [Teddie]]
Hwah!? I can't believe all of that[n]happened while I was away...!
I haven't done anything! I'm an innocent[n]bear!

[msg MSG_010 [Naoto]]
Yes, we know.
The Teddie we saw earlier acted far too[n]differently from how you would normally[n]behave.

[sel SEL_011 top]
What are you suggesting?
The culprit is someone else?
Were you possessed?

[msg MSG_012 [Akechi]]
In other words, all of the incidents[n]were carried out by someone disguised as[n]Teddie... Am I correct?

[msg MSG_013 [Akechi]]
Yes, someone probably disguised[n]themselves as Teddie... Is that right?

[msg MSG_014 [Teddie]]
Nwaah! I'm innocent! You've gotta[n]believe me!

[msg MSG_015 [Akechi]]
We know.
It's likely all of the incidents were[n]carried out by someone disguised as[n]Teddie... Wouldn't you agree?

[msg MSG_016 [Naoto]]
Yes, that is my opinion as well.
The question that remains is: who was[n]trying to pose as Teddie?

[msg MSG_017 [Akechi]]
Have you been in the screening room this[n]whole time, Teddie?

[msg MSG_018 [Teddie]]
A-ffirmative! I was hanging out with[n]Yosuke and the others.

[msg MSG_019 [Naoto]]
So you didn't hear the scream earlier?

[msg MSG_020 [Teddie]]
I don't think so.
We were watching a really loud movie at[n]the time, though, so maybe that's why...
But then Marga-chan got mad at us and[n]made us leave.

[msg MSG_021 [Akechi]]
What happened to your bear suit?

[msg MSG_022 [Teddie]]
It was stuffy in the screening room, so[n]I took it off and left it outside.

[msg MSG_023 [Akechi]]
I see. So the culprit took advantage of[n]that...

[msg MSG_024 [Naoto]]
Yes, I'm starting to see what happened,[n]and I believe I know who's responsible[n]as well...

[sel SEL_025 top]
Who?
I have an idea too.

[msg MSG_026 [Naoto]]
I would tell you, but we don't have[n]irrefutable evidence yet.
If the culprit decides to play dumb,[n]then we'll be out of options.
It would be best not to name any names[n]until we're absolutely certain.

[msg MSG_027 [Naoto]]
Then, you must also realize that we[n]still lack irrefutable evidence.
If the culprit decides to play dumb,[n]we'll be out of options.
Therefore, it would be best not to name[n]any names until we're absolutely[n]certain.

[msg MSG_028 [Akechi]]
In that case, I have an idea.
But if we want this to work, we're going[n]to need more of Theodore's popcorn.

[msg MSG_029 [Naoto]]
Which means we'll need to get him the[n]ingredients.

[msg MSG_030 [Akechi]]
Right. [f 6 1 30 0 0 0], whenever you're ready, we[n]should attempt that special screening.
