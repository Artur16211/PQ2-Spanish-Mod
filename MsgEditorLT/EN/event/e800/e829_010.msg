I've heard rumors that a vicious[n]Tyrannosaurus rex is roaming Junessic[n]Land once again.
The goal this time is to defeat a[n]Tyranniqueen.

[msg MSG_001 [Rise]]
The Tyranniqueen's that FOE in the[n]dinosaur movie, right?

[msg MSG_002 [Yosuke]]
That's the one. It's THE carnivore...[n]The strongest there is.

[msg MSG_003 [Teddie]]
Hm, I feel an intense battle coming up!

[msg MSG_004 [Futaba]]
We've gotten a lot stronger. It's not[n]like we don't stand a chance or[n]anything.
Besides, don't you think it's kind of[n]exciting going up against the strongest[n]dinosaur?

[sel SEL_005 top]
We'll take it together.
We'll show our courage.

[msg MSG_006 [Ken]]
Right. If the five of us work together,[n]there's nothing we can't beat.

[msg MSG_007 [Futaba]]
Ooh, good thinking. That totally sounded[n]like something you'd hear in those hero[n]shows!

[msg MSG_008 [Futaba]]
Whoa! That totally sounded like[n]something a hero would say! Good going,[n]Red.

[msg MSG_009 [Ken]]
Haha, you make a good leader,-san.

[msg MSG_010 [Yukari]]
Huh? Ken-kun looks like he's having fun.[n]What're you guys talking about?

[msg MSG_011 [Futaba]]
Phoenix Ranger Featherman! You're Pink,[n]Yukari... No surprise there.

[msg MSG_012 [Kanji]]
A-And I guess that means I'm Yellow.

[msg MSG_013 [Morgana]]
I thought you were the bad guy.

[msg MSG_014 [Kanji]]
Sh-Shut up!

[msg MSG_015 [Elizabeth]]
Head to Junessic Land when you're ready.[n]But before you do that... Could I[n]trouble you for a picture?
Oh, also, I forgot to mention: you'll[n]need to defeat two Tyranniqueens.

[msg MSG_016 [Yosuke]]
TWO!? That's a pretty important detail[n]to forget...

[msg MSG_017 [Elizabeth]]
Yes, well, the special screening[n]requires that you defeat two.

[msg MSG_018 [Futaba]]
Featherman: Carnivore Carnage! Defeat[n]the two dinosaur FOEs!

[msg MSG_019 [Ken]]
Haha, sounds like the title for next[n]week's episode.
I'm getting pretty excited myself. Let's[n]go, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]-san.
