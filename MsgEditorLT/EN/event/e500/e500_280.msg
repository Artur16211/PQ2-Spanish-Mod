Seriously? What's THAT doing here!?

[sel SEL_001 top]
It's from a different film reel.
It's a rerun.
Maybe it's been upgraded?

[msg MSG_002 [Aigis]]
Yes, I agree as well.

[msg MSG_003 [Akihiko]]
But we fixed the movie. Even if this[n]were a rerun, it still doesn't make[n]sense.

[msg MSG_004 [Junpei]]
Oh, come on! After all that trouble we[n]went through!?

[msg MSG_005 [Aigis]]
I believe this one is most likely[n]different than the one in the movie we[n]fixed.

[msg MSG_006 [P3 Hero]]
Since we changed Hikari-san's[n]consciousness, this film should be[n]corrected...

[msg MSG_007 [Akihiko]]
But the film we have here is still[n]distorted, huh...
If we leave it as is, everyone here'll[n]be forced to keep watching the shitty[n]version of this movie.

[msg MSG_008 [Junpei]]
Obviously, we gotta do somethin about[n]this―we'll just hafta fix this one too!

Your denial of this popular film makes[n]each one of you an error in this world.

This bullshit's no different from[n]brainwashin'.

[msg MSG_012 [Mother Computer]]
This is not brainwashing―it is merely[n]the proper system for a world.
If everyone discards their individuality[n]and becomes the same, unnecessary[n]quarrels will cease to exist.

[msg MSG_013 [Yukari]]
Don't make it sound like you're doing[n]the right thing. You're just forcing[n]your beliefs on everyone else!

[msg MSG_014 [Akihiko]]
She's right. Sometimes, the only way you[n]can come to understand something is[n]through some form of conflict.

[msg MSG_015 [Mitsuru]]
What you're demanding is nothing more[n]than abandoning our ability to think for[n]ourselves!

[msg MSG_016 [Mother Computer]]
You continually assert individualism and[n]try to spurn my world order... You are[n]obviously heretics.
You are heretics. Irregularities.[n]Errors. Bugs.

[sel SEL_017 top]
That's our business, not yours.
And what's wrong with that?

[msg MSG_018 [Aigis]]
That is correct! No matter what you say,[n]I am myself...
And that can never be changed!

[msg MSG_019 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_020 [Mother Computer]]
It has been determined that your errors[n]are fatal... Any further communication[n]is unnecessary.

Everyone! Here it comes!
