Ngh... Where are we?

[msg MSG_001 [Fuuka]]
Everyone! Are you all right!?

[msg MSG_002 [Mitsuru]]
Yamagishi...? So, we're back in Hikari's[n]movie theater?

[msg MSG_003 [Rise]]
Yeah. Looks like you were knocked all[n]the way back here.

[msg MSG_004 [Futaba]]
Enlil's power is off the charts...
But the power of those folks in the[n]theaters who refuse to listen to us[n]seems even stronger.

[msg MSG_005 [Ryuji]]
Dammit! Why the hell can't they get with[n]the program already!?

[msg MSG_006 [Yukiko]]
But, those people―didn't they seem like[n]they were actually a bit hesitant?

[msg MSG_007 [Yusuke]]
Yes. There were even some voices[n]expressing their desire for the sort of[n]courage we hoped for them to show...

[msg MSG_008 [Yukari]]
But in the end... they all gave up and[n]just stuck to hiding away.

[msg MSG_009 [Hikari]]
I think they're probably dealing with[n]the same problem I was...

[msg MSG_010 [Chie]]
What's that?

[msg MSG_011 [Hikari]]
Watching movies based on nothing but[n]your own painful memories makes you feel[n]like giving up would be easier...

[msg MSG_012 [Akechi]]
These people are basically subject to[n]mind control... Even if we were to speak[n]to them, who knows if they'd hear us.

[msg MSG_013 [Hikari]]
But, I was able to change for the[n]better, thanks to your editing the[n]movies in my theater.
They made me feel like I shouldn't[n]repress myself or fear the future― and[n]that's how movies ought to be.
If all those poor people had been[n]watching those movies instead, I bet[n]they'd all be thinking differently now.

[sel SEL_014 top]
That's it!
Then we'll screen those for them.

[msg MSG_015 [Haru]]
Aah! What's the shouting about!?

[msg MSG_016 [Akihiko]]
Did you come up with something?

[msg MSG_017 [Makoto]]
You mean Hikari-chan's movies that we[n]changed?
Are you thinking about showing those to[n]the others in the theaters?

[msg MSG_018 [Yosuke]]

[msg MSG_019 [Naoto]]
Well, it does seem to follow[n]logically...

[msg MSG_020 [Chie]]
Hold on, hold on! Sorry, but, uh... what[n]are you all talking about?

[msg MSG_021 [P3 Hero]]
We're not going to convince the[n]theatergoers at a time, but all at once,[n]with the help of Hikari-san's movies.
Does that about cover it?

[msg MSG_022 [P4 Hero]]
Yeah. If they watch those movies and[n]gain the courage to be themselves, their[n]theater doors should unlock...
Then everyone ought to want to leave[n]their theaters.

[msg MSG_023 [Shinjiro]]
So, how're we gonna get these movies on[n]their screens?

[msg MSG_024 [Fuuka]]
Hmm... Normally, movie theaters don't[n]all show the same thing at once.
If we hope to play Hikari-chan's movies[n]to everyone simultaneously, how would we[n]go about that?

[sel SEL_025 top]
There were those projectors...
We'll change the floor film.
Hikari can figure that part out.

[msg MSG_026 [Aigis]]
Correct―I did confirm four running[n]projectors in the vicinity.

[msg MSG_027 [Ken]]
But, how do we use them? Projectors are[n]machines that display film, right?

[msg MSG_028 [Chie]]
You mean the film that's flowing all[n]over the ground? You wanna change that?

[msg MSG_029 [Yukiko]]
Wait, could that film have something to[n]do with those four projectors we saw?

[msg MSG_030 [Junpei]]
Whoa, whoa! She may be an aspiring movie[n]director and all, but isn't that asking[n]a bit too much!?

[msg MSG_031 [Hikari]]
Oh, but maybe―What if we used those four[n]projectors we saw?

[msg MSG_032 [Yukari]]
Wait, you really came up with something?

[msg MSG_033 [Futaba]]
I get it! We just need to use those four[n]projectors to screen our own films!
The paths in the movie theater district[n]seem to be made of one long filmstrip[n]that reaches all the theaters there.

[msg MSG_034 [Haru]]
That film was really dark, too. And I[n]don't just mean the color balance...

[msg MSG_035 [Fuuka]]
Could that be causing some negative[n]effect in the other theatergoers?

[msg MSG_036 [Hikari]]
I think the floor film is made up of[n]everyone's darkest memories...

[msg MSG_037 [Akechi]]
So, it's a composite of people's[n]memories... That reminds me of the[n]Akashic records.

[msg MSG_038 [Kanji]]
Huh? What are those?

[msg MSG_039 [Naoto]]
They're supposedly the events and[n]emotions of the entire world written[n]down―indeed, that does ring similar...
However, what's being shown here is far[n]too biased to be called a true record of[n]anything, let alone everything.

[msg MSG_040 [Akechi]]
So, it's a composite of people's[n]memories...

[msg MSG_041 [Naoto]]
Indeed. However, what's being shown here[n]is far too biased to be accurate.

[msg MSG_042 [Hikari]]
Mmhm... This is a heavily edited version[n]of everyone's memories.
Everything fun or joyful in their lives[n]was cut from the film they're watching.

[msg MSG_043 [Yusuke]]

[msg MSG_044 [Makoto]]
When it came to Hikari-chan's movies[n]being screened, we changed them one at a[n]time...
But, to change the consciousnesses of[n]the theatergoers, we need to strike at[n]the root cause, all at once.

[msg MSG_045 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I see! So all we have to do is change[n]the film in the projectors to[n]Hikari-chan's movies.
If we do that, I'm sure everyone...

[sel SEL_046 top]
They'll gain courage.
They'll leave their theaters.
They'll... Well, we don't know.

[msg MSG_047 [Teddie]]
Will everyone get cheered up like[n]Hikarin did?

[msg MSG_048 [Kanji]]
Then, we gotta do this!

[msg MSG_049 [Ann]]
Yeah. I bet it'll help everybody!

[msg MSG_050 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_051 [Mitsuru]]
True, there's no guarantee that they'll[n]change if we play Hikari's movies for[n]them. However...
We aren't the type of people to give up[n]without trying―am I correct?

[msg MSG_052 [Akihiko]]

[msg MSG_053 [P4 Hero]]
Then it's decided―let's swap that[n]negative movie with Hikari's.

[msg MSG_054 [P3 Hero]]
All we need to do is swap out the film[n]in those projectors we found earlier,[n]right?

[msg MSG_055 [Morgana]]
In that case, we need to grab the movies[n]about Hikari's life that we changed and[n]take 'em back to the projectors.
C'mon, let's get to the projection room!
