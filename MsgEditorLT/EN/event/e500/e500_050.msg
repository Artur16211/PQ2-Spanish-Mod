[msg MSG_000 [Yukiko]]
Hey, we came back here without much[n]thought―couldn't we get trapped here[n]again?

[msg MSG_001 [Yusuke]]
Considering what Enlil told us, I doubt[n]she would do that...

[msg MSG_001_5 [Yusuke]]
The locks represented Hikari's desire to[n]remain here.
Since Hikari made the decision to leave,[n]Enlil has shown no intention of stopping[n]her.

[msg MSG_002 [Mitsuru]]
Hm. While this place may still be safe[n]for us, the remaining movie theaters are[n]the real issue...
Until their inhabitants gain the will to[n]leave, their doors will remain closed.

[msg MSG_003 [Haru]]
I wonder what'll happen to those people[n]if they stay here forever...
I mean, Enlil said they'd be safe...

[msg MSG_004 [Ken]]
But they're not thinking for themselves.[n]That's just...

[sel SEL_005 top]
They're totally apathetic.
They're like mental shutdowns...

[msg MSG_006 [Yukari]]
Think about it... That's no different[n]than being dead!

[msg MSG_007 [Mitsuru]]
And who knows how many people are[n]entering the movie theater district as[n]we speak...

[msg MSG_008 [Makoto]]
Correct. They've lost their wills to[n]live, just like those in the mental[n]shutdown cases...

[msg MSG_009 [Ann]]
There are that many people like that[n]here!? And their numbers are still[n]growing!?

[msg MSG_010 [Teddie]]
Noooo! This is an emergency! If this[n]keeps up... um, um...
...What's going to happen?

[msg MSG_011 [Yosuke]]
Would you calm down!? Now's the time[n]that we sorta need out―

[msg MSG_011_5 [Yosuke]]
...Need to sort out the information we[n]have already!

[msg MSG_012 [Chie]]
You're the one who needs to calm down.

[msg MSG_013 [Yukiko]]
Now that's our Yosuke-kun. He's really[n]putting up a fight defending his title[n]of Prince of Disappointment.

[msg MSG_014 [Yosuke]]
Could you guys give me a break, just[n]this once!?

[msg MSG_015 [P4 Hero]]
...So, do you know anything about this,[n]Margaret?

[msg MSG_016 [Margaret]]
Well, to begin with, the ramifications[n]it will have on the real world cannot be[n]overlooked.

[msg MSG_017 [Naoto]]
Why is that?

[msg MSG_018 [Elizabeth]]
Eventually, those movie theaters will[n]encroach upon the very fabric of your[n]realities...

[msg MSG_018_5 [Elizabeth]]
...Or something of that nature.

[msg MSG_019 [Shinjiro]]
The world's gonna get flooded with those[n]shitty theaters?

[msg MSG_020 [Akihiko]]
The whole place is gonna be lousy with[n]dead-eyed shut-ins...
That sounds like a real garbage heap to[n]me.

[msg MSG_021 [Hikari]]
I don't want anyone else to go through[n]what happened to me here...

[msg MSG_022 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Yeah―we definitely won't let it happen![n]Let's take care of this theater world.

[msg MSG_023 [P4 Hero]]
We should prepare ourselves for what's[n]shaping up to be our final battle and[n]head out whenever we're ready.
