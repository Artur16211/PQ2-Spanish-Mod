Heh! That ain't gonna stop us!

It's true that you're all quite strong.[n]You even have the power to resist me.
However, expecting such strength from[n]every person is nothing but arrogance...

[msg MSG_002 [Yukari]]
What do you mean by that?

[msg MSG_003 [Enlil]]
It's quite easy to say aloud, "Stand up[n]for yourselves."
However, actually expecting everyone to[n]be as strong and brave as yourselves?

[msg MSG_004 [Akihiko]]
Are you trying to tell us we're wrong[n]for wanting to help these people?

[msg MSG_005 [Enlil]]
I understand that you are doing your[n]best to change the hearts of those in[n]the theaters...
But is that truly what they desire?
Look for yourselvesâ€•these are the true[n]feelings of the feeble creatures called[n]"human beings"...
