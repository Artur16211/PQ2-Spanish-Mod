What is this room?

[msg MSG_001 [Ken]]
Look at that huge machine... Is it a[n]projector?

[msg MSG_002 [Aigis]]
That seems to be accurate. I have[n]confirmed four of them within visual[n]range.

[msg MSG_003 [Kanji]]
Ain't there somethin' weird about the[n]light comin' from that projector?
The colors seem all gross. Is the movie[n]messed up somehow?

[msg MSG_004 [Akechi]]
It looks like it's the negatives of a[n]film that are being screened.

[msg MSG_005 [Hikari]]
That's right. The reason that negatives[n]make people feel sick is the inversion[n]of colors flipping the light and dark...
The film is de-inverted during printing,[n]so in the end, the colors come out like[n]you normally see them on the screen.

[sel SEL_006 top]
Oh, I see...
Is there more to this?
*snore*

[msg MSG_007 [Futaba]]
She can't help it, she's an enthusiast.[n]Just be polite―smile, nod along... There[n]you go.

[msg MSG_008 [Futaba]]
Hey, no dozing off! You have to listen[n]until she's finished.

[msg MSG_009 [Hikari]]
Since any inverted film is called[n]"negatives," re-reversed ones could be[n]referred to as the "positives."
There's also something called "reversal[n]film" that records positive images right[n]away, instead of negative images...
But movies tend to be shot in negatives[n]because touch-ups and duplication are[n]easier with that type of film.

[msg MSG_010 [Ryuji]]
R-Right. I, uh... I didn't get any of[n]that.

[msg MSG_011 [Hikari]]
Oh...

[msg MSG_012 [Naoto]]
You seem to be quite an expert on the[n]matter, Hikari-san.

[msg MSG_013 [Hikari]]
Huh? Oh, um... I guess I get really[n]worked up when talking about movies...

[msg MSG_014 [Shinjiro]]
That's fine. Gettin' worked up over[n]something you like is normal.

[msg MSG_015 [Morgana]]
Hmm, negative images and positive[n]images... Don't those remind you of[n]something, Joker?

[sel SEL_016 top]
Negative emotions.
Positive emotions.
I don't know what you mean.

[msg MSG_017 [Morgana]]
Exactly―that!

[msg MSG_018 [Akechi]]
Based on what we've experienced, they[n]certainly seem like analogous[n]concepts...

[msg MSG_019 [Akechi]]

[msg MSG_020 [Chie]]
Y-Yeah, "analogous concepts"... Just[n]like, uh... pork cheek and pork butt,[n]right?

[msg MSG_021 [Yosuke]]
Do you have any clue what we're talking[n]about? And is meat REALLY the only thing[n]on your mind!?

[msg MSG_022 [Haru]]
Well, for example, cheerful people are[n]called "positive," while gloomy people[n]are referred to as "negative"...

[msg MSG_023 [Yosuke]]
Ahh, I get it. This is starting to make[n]sense now.

[msg MSG_024 [Yusuke]]
What we really need to determine is[n]where these negatives are being[n]screened.

[msg MSG_025 [Rise]]
Hmm... Do you think it has anything to[n]do with the film that you're walking on?

[msg MSG_026 [Yukari]]
Oh, good point. This film covering the[n]ground―is this more of the negatives?

[msg MSG_027 [Fuuka]]
It seems to head into all sorts of[n]directions. We'll keep looking into it.
If we find anything out, we'll update[n]you right away.

[msg MSG_028 [Mitsuru]]
Please do so.
It seems we should leave our questions[n]about this to our navigators. We have[n]our own duties to carry out here.

[msg MSG_029 [Ken]]
Yes, let's get moving!
