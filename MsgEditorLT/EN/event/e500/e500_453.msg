[msg MSG_000 [Haru]]
The doors to the theaters are shining?

[msg MSG_001 [Margaret]]
A short moment ago, a change seems to[n]have occurred to space and time...
Each door is connected to one of your[n]worlds.

[msg MSG_002 [Theodore]]
We will serve as your guides on your[n]journeys back. Have no fear.

[msg MSG_003 [Ryuji]]
Y'know, now that we can go back an' all,[n]it's kind of a bummer...

[msg MSG_004 [Ann]]
Yeah. We wanted to get home so badly,[n]but now I'm just feeling a bit sad.

[msg MSG_005 [Chie]]
B-But, hey! If we want to meet again,[n]won't we be able to?
I mean, those blue doors we've been[n]using are connected to all our different[n]worlds, right!?

[msg MSG_006 [Futaba]]
O-Oh, I get it! So, we can just get in[n]touch with Hikari and―

[msg MSG_007 [Elizabeth]]
Unfortunately, that will be impossible.

[msg MSG_008 [Ann]]
Huh? Why!?

[msg MSG_009 [Margaret]]
This world could be likened to a special[n]stage that was built for only a single[n]night's performance.
And just like a dream in the night, this[n]fleeting illusion will end the moment[n]you awaken.
Everything about this world is[n]transient, and will disappear from[n]within you all as well.

[msg MSG_010 [Hikari]]
So, we won't remember anything from this[n]once we leave?

[msg MSG_011 [Elizabeth]]
Yes, that appears to be the case.
Even time itself was different from the[n]norm in this place...
It could be said that the impossible was[n]rendered possible here because of how[n]this world functions.
That is why the memories made here[n]cannot be taken back to your own worlds,[n]with their own laws of reality.

[msg MSG_012 [Yosuke]]
Seriously...?

[msg MSG_013 [P3 Fem Protag]]
No... We're all going to forget each[n]other?

[sel SEL_014 top]
We'll always be close to you all.
We'll meet again someday.
I don't want to go back.

[msg MSG_015 [Hikari]]
You'll be close by?

[msg MSG_016 [Hikari]]
I agree... I think we'll definitely meet[n]again.

[msg MSG_017 [Caroline]]
Cease your whining, Inmate! Once you get[n]back, we're returning to your[n]rehabilitation immediately!

[msg MSG_018 [Hikari]]
I'm happy that I met and grew to be[n]friends with all of you...
We cried, we laughed, we got angry...[n]All because you watched over me that I[n]was able to change.

[msg MSG_019 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hikari-chan...

[msg MSG_019_1 [Hikari]]
If this were a movie, this is the best[n]ending that could ever happen.

[msg MSG_019_2 [P3 Fem Protag]]
*giggle* In that case, your performance[n]was worthy of a Best Leading Actress[n]award.

[msg MSG_019_3 [Hikari]]
Actually, I think all of you were the[n]leading actors here.
Think about how no two people served the[n]same role. If any of you weren't here,[n]we couldn't have reached this ending.
...Right?

[msg MSG_019_4 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Yeah, I suppose...

[msg MSG_019_5 [P3 Fem Protag]]
No, I'm positive you're right!

[msg MSG_020 [P4 Hero]]
Even if our memories from here are lost,[n]our bond won't ever fade away.

[msg MSG_021 [P3 Hero]]
Our meeting each other here's led to a[n]whole new part of myself being born...
And that part of me isn't going[n]anywhere. I know it won't disappear.

[msg MSG_022 [Hikari]]
Mmhm! I'm sure I'll continue to grow[n]from here on out...
But that doesn't scare me anymore. I'm[n]sure I'll be able to move forward with a[n]smile on my face.
This is such a huge first step that I'll[n]be able to take, all because you gave me[n]the strength I needed...
That's why, even if my memories are[n]lost... I'll be okay.

[msg MSG_023 [Futaba]]
Ah! Th-That reminds me! I almost forgot!
Hey, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]―Hikari's notebook!

[msg MSG_024 [Ken]]
You mean the one we were drawing the[n]maps in?
So, that originally belonged to[n]Hikari-san...

[msg MSG_025 [Hikari]]
Yeah. I was going to write all my[n]screenplay ideas in that.
It's a notebook I asked my dad to buy[n]for me some time ago.
When I first got here, I wasn't able to[n]remember that.

[msg MSG_026 [Futaba]]
This is important for your dream, right?[n]That's why we've gotta give it back!

[msg MSG_027 [Hikari]]
Huh?

[msg MSG_028 [Ryuji]]
C'mon, Hikari―remember the promise we[n]made?
Y'know, if you shoot a movie one day,[n]you'll invite us to watch it too?

[msg MSG_029 [Yukari]]
Then you better be sure to take that[n]notebook back with you.

[msg MSG_030 [Naoto]]
Yes, I believe it'll be vital to your[n]efforts, Hikari-san.

[msg MSG_031 [Hikari]]
Everyone...

[msg MSG_031_5 [Hikari]]
Okay. Thank you!

[msg MSG_032]
I returned the notebook to Hikari...

[msg MSG_033 [Morgana]]
You told us that life is like a movie,[n]right?
That means the time we've spent together[n]is all part of your life―your movie!

[msg MSG_034 [Yosuke]]
Our bonds are etched into us, just like[n]the maps drawn in that notebook, right?

[msg MSG_035 [Teddie]]
Yep yep! I mean, everyone here is..

[msg MSG_036 [Fuuka]]
No matter where we may be...

[msg MSG_037 [Yukiko]]
No matter when it may be...

[msg MSG_038 [Aigis]]
We will always be precious friends and[n]companions to each other.

[msg MSG_039 [Koromaru]]
Arf arf!

[msg MSG_040 [Hikari]]
I... I'll definitely complete my movie,[n]everyone!

[msg MSG_041 [Makoto]]
I can't wait to watch it! It's a[n]promise, okay?

[msg MSG_041_5 [Haru]]
We swear we'll all go see it!

[msg MSG_042 [Hikari]]
Mmhm!
