Theater District, Depths...

[msg MSG_001 [Kanji]]
I hope you're ready, dammit―

[msg MSG_002 [Kanji]]
...What the hell? Nobody's here!

[msg MSG_003 [Junpei]]
Aw man, did we go the wrong way?

[msg MSG_004 [Rise]]
Everyone! Look up there!

[msg MSG_005 [Enlil]]
My... You simply can't get enough of[n]your interfering here, eh?

[msg MSG_006 [Naoto]]
Enlil!

[msg MSG_007 [Enlil]]
It's incomprehensible to me―why are you[n]putting so much effort into fighting for[n]complete strangers?
Had you simply heeded my word and[n]returned to your worlds, all of your[n]struggles here would be concluded.

[msg MSG_008 [Yosuke]]
I can understand the feeling―wanting to[n]run away, and not wanting to get hurt...
But, that's why I can't just walk away[n]from what you're doing!

[msg MSG_009 [Ann]]
If I ran away from this, I wouldn't be[n]acting on my beliefs―and I'd never do[n]something like that!

[msg MSG_010 [Enlil]]
Is that so? And...? What can you[n]actually do, anyway?

[msg MSG_011 [Yusuke]]
The time has come: thrust our plan into[n]her face, Joker!

[sel SEL_012 top]
This calling card―it's for you!
We're taking your film!

"Madame Enlil, curator of the movie[n]theaters of deceit..."
"ひもょぼま をよゎ らゅぺを ゆよわもまれ ろめぺろ ぺぽわよぼぺろま[n]れまゅみ-ぺほゎれま ぺょぽ ろるもぼや ぺゎぽもまょぼま ゆまゆほまるれ もょろよ[n]ぼよょみゎれもょむ れよゎゅゅまれれょまれれ みよる らまぺぼまテテテ"
"We will steal those distorted movies[n]from you. Signed, the Phantom Thieves."

[msg MSG_014 [Enlil]]
Steal distorted movies...? What are you[n]going on about here?

[msg MSG_015 [Makoto]]
Unless we change these theatergoers'[n]beliefs, driving you off for good will[n]be impossible.
That's why we had to devise a plan.

[msg MSG_016 [Haru]]
Yes―we came up with a way to radically[n]change the hearts of everyone here.

[msg MSG_017 [Morgana]]
Oracle! All set!?

[msg MSG_018 [Futaba]]
Yup! Ready to go on this end!

[msg MSG_019 [Ryuji]]
Alright! Let 'em have it, Hikari!

[msg MSG_020 [Hikari]]
Mmhm! Let's do this, everyone!

[msg MSG_021 [Enlil]]
......!?
