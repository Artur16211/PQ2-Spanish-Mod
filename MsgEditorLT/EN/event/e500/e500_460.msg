[msg MSG_000 [Margaret]]
Now then, I shall return with and his[n]friends.
Come, Marie. You guide the way.

[msg MSG_001 [Marie]]
Fine, fine. Are you all ready? Right[n]this way...

[msg MSG_002 [Makoto]]
When we meet again, let's go relax at a[n]caf〒 together.

[msg MSG_003 [Ryuji]]
I vote for ramen. I know a great place,[n]so let's go eat there.

[msg MSG_004 [Junpei]]
Ooh, ramen, you say? There's a special[n]joint we know about, too.

[msg MSG_005 [Ann]]
Ramen sounds nice and all, but how about[n]a dessert buffet?

[msg MSG_006 [Rise]]
Sounds great! I wanna do a girls-only[n]get-together too!

[msg MSG_007 [Yukari]]
Hrgh, here come the calories...

[msg MSG_008 [Aigis]]
Yukari-san―the proper response to such a[n]suggestion is, "I'll start my diet right[n]after that."

[msg MSG_009 [Yosuke]]
If we're gonna meet up, our own food[n]court's not a bad contender either.
So, please consider patronizing the[n]Yasoinaba branch of Junes!

[msg MSG_010 [Chie]]
You walking ad!

[msg MSG_011 [Margaret]]
Everyone... it's time.

[msg MSG_012 [P4 Hero]]
Looks like we've gotta go.

[msg MSG_013 [Naoto]]
Everyone, thank you for everything.

[msg MSG_014 [Teddie]]
Be sure to keep this bear in mind,[n]everybody!

[msg MSG_015 [Yukiko]]
I look forward to when we meet again.

[msg MSG_016 [Rise]]
Bye-bye, for real this time!

[msg MSG_017 [Chie]]
Let's meet up again!

[msg MSG_018 [Kanji]]
Thanks for everythin', guys.

[msg MSG_019 [Yosuke]]
That was a blast. See ya around!

[msg MSG_020 [P4 Hero]]
Well then... See you, everyone.

[msg MSG_021 [Elizabeth]]
Now, my own guest's world will be this[n]way.

[msg MSG_022 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Um, about me...

[msg MSG_023 [Theodore]]
This way please, [f 6 1 27 0 0 0]. I shall be your[n]guide...

[msg MSG_024 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Theo! Sure, thanks.

[msg MSG_025 [Mitsuru]]
It's time for us to return as well.
I'm grateful for meeting you all.

[msg MSG_026 [Ken]]
Thanks for everything―let's meet again[n]somewhere!

[msg MSG_027 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_028 [Aigis]]
Futaba-san taught me the proper way to[n]say farewell earlier...
Everyone, I'm going to make like a tree[n]and get out of here!

[msg MSG_029 [Fuuka]]
*giggle* Oh, Aigis...
Well then, please take care of[n]yourselves!

[msg MSG_030 [Yukari]]
See you later, everyone!

[msg MSG_031 [Akihiko]]
...I've got a feeling we'll meet you[n]again soon.

[msg MSG_032 [Junpei]]
Take it easy, guys!

[msg MSG_033 [Shinjiro]]
Thanks for everythin'... See ya.

[msg MSG_034 [P3 Hero]]
...Wait, [f 6 1 27 0 0 0].

[msg MSG_035 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Huh?

[msg MSG_036 [P3 Hero]]
I'm glad I met you.

[msg MSG_037 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Yeah, me too!

[msg MSG_038 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hey, [f 6 1 16 0 0]-kun. Do you think, one day,[n]we might...
......

[msg MSG_039 [P3 Fem Protag]]
...Nah, it's nothing. Take care!

[msg MSG_040 [P3 Hero]]
You too.

[msg MSG_041 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Bye, everyone!

[msg MSG_042 [P3 Hero]]
Well, see you around.

[msg MSG_043 [Ann]]
...They've all gone back.

[msg MSG_044 [Haru]]
We went through such a rough time, but[n]when I think back on it, I feel like it[n]went by in a flash.

[msg MSG_045 [Yusuke]]
Indeed―but this was a truly beautiful[n]ending.

[msg MSG_046 [Makoto]]
Agreed. What happened here is one of the[n]most important parts of our lives...
But, why were we brought here in the[n]first place?

[msg MSG_047 [Caroline]]
Who knows? However...

[msg MSG_048 [Caroline]]
This ending was attainable solely[n]because of yourselves. That's all the[n]reason you need!

[msg MSG_049 [Justine]]
Inmate... I only hope what transpired[n]here will have a positive effect on your[n]rehabilitation.
And perhaps... even on others as well...

[msg MSG_050 [Justine]]
No, pay that no mind.

[msg MSG_051 [Caroline]]
Now, hurry it up and get through that[n]door! Are you ready, Inmate et cetera!?

[msg MSG_052 [Haru]]
Theater 1... This is where it all began.

[msg MSG_053 [Futaba]]
Aw, yeah! I wanna hurry back and eat[n]some of Sojiro's curry!

[msg MSG_054 [Ann]]
I want some too! Let's all go to[n]Leblanc.

[msg MSG_055 [Ryuji]]
It's not like we'll remember that,[n]right? Well, at least we go to Leblanc[n]all the time anyways.

[msg MSG_056 [Yusuke]]
I would like to put in an order for a[n]coffee.

[msg MSG_057 [Morgana]]
Geez, where are these people's shame...[n]Well, if we're piling it on, put me down[n]for some top-grade sushi!

[msg MSG_058 [Makoto]]
No problem, if Morgana's paying.

[msg MSG_059 [Futaba]]
Ooh, you're gonna treat us!? How[n]generous, Mona!

[msg MSG_060 [Morgana]]
Hell no! Why can't you guys show ME some[n]generosity for a change!?

[msg MSG_061 [Akechi]]
......

[sel SEL_062 top]
What's up?
Let's go back.

[msg MSG_063 [Akechi]]
Huh? Oh... Yeah. Sorry, I spaced out for[n]a moment there.

[msg MSG_064 [Akechi]]
Go back, huh? Yeah, you're right...

[msg MSG_065 [Akechi]]
We need to get back to...

[msg MSG_066 [Yusuke]]
What's the matter, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]?

[msg MSG_067 [Futaba]]
Heeeeey, hustle your buns!

[msg MSG_068 [Akechi]]
They're calling for us... Let's go,.
