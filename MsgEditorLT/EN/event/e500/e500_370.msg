Dammit... No matter what we throw at[n]her, we're getting nowhere!

[msg MSG_001 [P3 Hero]]
*pant* *pant* We're in real trouble if[n]this keeps up...

Ngh... We're not done yet!

[msg MSG_004 [Enlil]]
Why can't you understand? No one here[n]needs your assistance...
All you're doing is trying to impose[n]your own beliefs onto my theatergoers.

[msg MSG_005 [Hikari]]
Th-That's not true at all!

[msg MSG_006 [Enlil]]
Hikari-san?

[msg MSG_007 [Hikari]]
Everyone! Listen!

[msg MSG_008 [Hikari]]
I've been denying who I really am for so[n]long...

Honestly, I hated myself for being like[n]that. I always felt so miserable, all[n]the time...

Haven't you all done the same thing?

[msg MSG_009 [Listless man]]
That... That's just like me...

[msg MSG_010 [Languid man]]
Yeah, all I could do was run away...

[msg MSG_011 [Despondent woman]]
But... What does that matter?

[msg MSG_012 [Upset woman]]
I can't do anything about it anyway...

[msg MSG_013 [Enlil]]
......

[msg MSG_014 [Hikari]]
Are you really fine with movies where[n]the protagonists stay weak? Where they[n]only keep running away?
Can you really say, from the depths of[n]your hearts, that constantly watching[n]movies like those makes you happy!?
Please... Watch this movie instead and[n]remember!

[msg MSG_015 [Hikari]]
Remember the kind of protagonist you[n]want to be in your own movie!
Never forget, you have the leading role[n]in your own life!

[msg MSG_016 [Listless man]]
My life...

[msg MSG_017 [Languid man]]
But, still...

[msg MSG_018 [Upset woman]]
What should I do?

[msg MSG_019 [Enlil]]
Stop this.

[msg MSG_020 [Hikari]]

[msg MSG_021 [Enlil]]
The theatergoers are delicate and easily[n]confused. You mustn't unnecessarily[n]upset them.
If you continue this, I will show no[n]mercy―even to a powerless person such as[n]yourself.

[msg MSG_022 [Hikari]]
I'm not powerless.

[msg MSG_023 [Enlil]]
Oh? How so?

[msg MSG_024 [Hikari]]
Meeting everyone here and seeing their[n]strength guide them towards their goals[n]gave me courage.

[msg MSG_024_5 [Hikari]]
They're why I remembered the true reason[n]for my love of movies.
Movies always taught me what matters the[n]most...
Taking action gives courage to others,[n]then that courage moves even more[n]people.

[msg MSG_025 [Enlil]]
And what does that matter?

[msg MSG_026 [Hikari]]
No matter how small, even my own step[n]forward should give courage to others.
It's not just my courage, either.[n]Everyone has the ability to be a source[n]of strength to others.

[msg MSG_026_5 [Hikari]]
That's why no one is really helpless― we[n]all have the power to change!

[msg MSG_027 [Ryuji]]
Heheh, you tell her!

[msg MSG_028 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hikari-chan's grown strong―and every[n]last person in the theaters here can do[n]the same thing!

[msg MSG_029 [Enlil]]
......!?
