Individuality? That's the kind of thing[n]that only ends up being a pain for[n]people...

[msg MSG_001]
It's not like anyone sees me for who I[n]really am, anyhow...

[msg MSG_002]
That's right... I'm not the only one[n]here who thinks that... There are others[n]like me...

[msg MSG_003]
I'm just so tired of all this pain,[n]and... Is the easy way out really all[n]that bad?

[msg MSG_003_5]
I know it's not really the right thing,[n]but... if I don't speak up, I won't get[n]hurt.

[msg MSG_009]
See? Everyone else agrees...

[msg MSG_009_5]
That's how I know... I'm not doing[n]anything wrong.

[msg MSG_015]
Yeah... Whoever feels like gettin' out[n]and tryin' can go and do that...

[msg MSG_015_5]
Me, though... I don't ever wanna leave[n]this place.
