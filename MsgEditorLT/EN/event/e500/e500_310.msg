[msg MSG_000 [Rise]]
Okay, that takes care of all four films!

[msg MSG_001 [Naoto]]
All that's left is to play our movie for[n]all the theatergoers.

[msg MSG_002 [Kanji]]
So, we're done once Oracle flips the[n]switch?

[msg MSG_003 [Morgana]]
Should be, yeah...

[msg MSG_004 [Hikari]]
Um... I... still have something I need[n]to do.

[msg MSG_005 [Akechi]]
What do you need to do? Did we forget[n]something?

[msg MSG_006 [Hikari]]
I still want to talk to Nagi-san... to[n]Enlil.

[msg MSG_007 [Ann]]
You WHAT!?

[msg MSG_008 [Hikari]]
The people here in these theaters may be[n]able to leave...
But I have a feeling more people like[n]them will just continue to be drawn[n]here.

[msg MSG_009 [Yukari]]
Well, we are talking about people's[n]reactions to pain. These kinds of issues[n]might never go away.

[msg MSG_010 [Hikari]]
In the end, all we would accomplish is[n]swapping out theatergoers―Enlil would[n]just keep showing movies to them.
That would be pointless, so... I want to[n]tell Enlil how I feel before we leave.

[msg MSG_010_5 [Hikari]]
I want her to know why I was able to[n]change, and what the "salvation" I[n]needed really was.

[sel SEL_011 top]
You should do that.
She may not listen...
Do what you want.

[msg MSG_012 [Hikari]]
Mmhm! I'll definitely try, at least.
After all, you're the ones who taught me[n]to never give up.

[msg MSG_013 [Akechi]]
True. It's highly likely that we'll end[n]up fighting her.

[msg MSG_014 [Hikari]]
Even still... I don't want to regret[n]anything I do anymore.

[msg MSG_015 [Morgana]]
You've gotten pretty good at asserting[n]yourself, Hikari. Not bad at all!

[msg MSG_016 [Hikari]]
Well, you're the ones who taught me to[n]never give up.

[msg MSG_017 [Akechi]]
Would she listen to you, though? It's[n]highly likely that another confrontation[n]with her will result in a fight.

[msg MSG_018 [Hikari]]
Even still... I don't want to regret[n]anything I do anymore.

[msg MSG_019 [Morgana]]
You've gotten pretty good at asserting[n]yourself, Hikari. Not bad at all!

[msg MSG_020 [Hikari]]
Well, you're the ones who taught me to[n]never give up.

[msg MSG_021 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Ahaha! You know, that's true!

[msg MSG_022 [Ryuji]]
Well, that plan sounds good to me. Let's[n]go show Enlil what's up.

[msg MSG_023 [Akihiko]]
Yeah―she's not getting the better of me[n]anymore.

[msg MSG_024 [Teddie]]
Me too, me too! I'll tag along to the[n]very end!

[msg MSG_025 [Shinjiro]]
None of us came this far with half-assed[n]intentions...
There's no way we can just turn tail[n]without showin' her we mean business.

[msg MSG_026 [Hikari]]
Everyone...

[sel SEL_027 top]
Let's do this.
Just some finishing touches first.

[msg MSG_028 [P3 Hero]]
So many hopes are on the line here... So[n]many people's futures.

[msg MSG_029 [P4 Hero]]
Is everyone else ready?

[msg MSG_030 [Yosuke]]
Yeah, I'm good whenever!

[msg MSG_031 [Junpei]]
Same here! If I were to back down now,[n]I'd feel like less of a man.

[msg MSG_032 [Mitsuru]]
We all seem to be prepared.

[msg MSG_033 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_034 [Fuuka]]
Go ahead and prepare as much as you[n]can―we'll be here to give you the best[n]support possible.

[msg MSG_035 [Futaba]]
Listen up, everybody: we're gonna square[n]off with Enlil. Make sure we're fully[n]prepared, okay?
Whenever you think we're ready, it's[n]time to find Enlil and let Hikari give[n]her a piece of her mind!
