I've been... so conceited all this time.
I abused my power, believing that[n]oppressing the citizens would benefit[n]the whole of society...

[msg MSG_000_1 [Kamoshidaman]]
But it's because of this power that I[n]must not mistake the purpose of my[n]authority!

[msg MSG_001 [Kamoshidaman]]
HAHAHA!

[msg MSG_001_1 [Kamoshidaman]]
The reborn Kamoshidaman shall never[n]mistreat a troubled citizen again!
