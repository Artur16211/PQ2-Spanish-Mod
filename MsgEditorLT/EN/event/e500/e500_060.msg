So, I've been wondering about these[n]paths we're walking onâ€•are they made of[n]some kind of film?

[msg MSG_001 [P3 Hero]]
Yeah. No matter where we look,[n]everything here's been fabricated by[n]her.

[msg MSG_002 [Yosuke]]
Man, she went from the boss of one movie[n]theater to the being that created a[n]whole world full of them... How crazy.

[msg MSG_003 [P4 Hero]]
The being that created this world,[n]huh...
I guess that means identifying herself[n]as the theater's curator wasn't exactly[n]a lie.

[msg MSG_004 [Hikari]]
I wonder if those people we saw earlier[n]are stuck watching nothing but distorted[n]movies, like I'd been.

[msg MSG_005 [Makoto]]
Considering what Enlil had told us,[n]they're most likely stuck with those[n]movies...
Nothing but collections of nasty[n]memories cut from their own lives.

[msg MSG_006 [Yusuke]]
Cutting and pasting their memories... In[n]a way, they're similar to real movies.

[sel SEL_007 top]
You mean they've been edited?
What do you mean by that?

[msg MSG_008 [Hikari]]
Mmhm, that's what it reminds me of[n]too...
It's an outdated method nowadays, but I[n]can remember my dad physically[n]connecting pieces of film, long ago.

[msg MSG_009 [Hikari]]
Movies are edited by cutting and pasting[n]together segments of film.
It's an outdated method nowadays, but I[n]can remember my dad physically[n]connecting pieces of film, long ago.

[msg MSG_010 [Akechi]]
True, movies are products of edited[n]material... One could even edit them[n]with malicious intent.

[msg MSG_011 [Hikari]]
No, you can't just do something like[n]that! That's not what movies are meant[n]to be!

[msg MSG_012 [Hikari]]
Oh... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to yell[n]like that.

[msg MSG_013 [Shinjiro]]
Go on... Obviously there's something you[n]feel like getting off your chest, yeah?

[msg MSG_014 [Hikari]]
I... I want movies to be a source of[n]hope for their audiences.
Even if you're feeling tired or down,[n]movies can give you the strength to keep[n]on trying.
It's all because I loved movies like[n]those ones that I...

[msg MSG_015 [Ryuji]]
What's up, Hikari?

[msg MSG_016 [Hikari]]
Oh, it's nothing. Let's go!

[msg MSG_017 [Ryuji]]
Huh? Uh... Wait!
