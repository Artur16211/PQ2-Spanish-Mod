Okay, let's go over our plan again.
Enlil's theatergoers are watching extra-[n]depressing movies―or in other words,[n]"negative films."
びめまれま みもゅゆれ ぺるま れぺぽぽゅもょむ ろめま ろめまぺろまるむよまるれ ゐもろめ[n]れよ ゆゎぼめ ょまむぺろもわま まゆよろもよょデ ろめまを'わま ぺゅゅ ゅよぼやまぽ[n]ろめまゆれまゅわまれ もょ ろめまもる ろめまぺろまるれテ

[msg MSG_001 [P4 Hero]]
Everyone is watching something[n]different, but it all seems to be[n]connected somehow as well.

[msg MSG_002 [Makoto]]
We could view the source of the negative[n]film as if it were a tree trunk...
And the countless movie theaters are[n]screening the branches and leaves that[n]have spread from the trunk.

[msg MSG_003 [Haru]]
If the negative film is poisonous to[n]their minds, then positive film should[n]serve as nourishment.
Any poison flowing from the trunk would[n]spread through the branches and[n]leaves―same with nourishment, too.

[msg MSG_004 [Yosuke]]
That's why we're gonna change this[n]negative film to Hikari-chan's film,[n]right?
If we do that, then those theater[n]people...

[sel SEL_005 top]
They'll come to their senses.
They'll gain courage.
They'll exit their theaters.

[msg MSG_006 [Akechi]]
Right. Well, there's no absolute[n]guarantee that'll happen...
But at the very least, I believe that[n]this movie will give them impetus and[n]the courage to change their minds.

[msg MSG_007 [Ken]]
All of this film is made of pieces of[n]memories where people's individualities[n]were denied...
It would be so draining to watch nothing[n]but that―both physically and mentally...

[msg MSG_008 [Akihiko]]
Even though a life can be full of pain,[n]not all of a person's memories during[n]that time are depressing ones.

[msg MSG_009 [Yukiko]]
When you've faced too much trauma or[n]pain, the depressing memories will often[n]cover up the happy ones.
Even if someone wants to hold onto those[n]fun, cheerful memories...

[msg MSG_010 [Ryuji]]
That's why we gotta hurry up and swap[n]out that shitty movie―to make 'em all[n]remember!

[msg MSG_011 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Right!

[msg MSG_012 [Futaba]]
Now listen up: there are a total of four[n]projectors.
Once you finish setting all of the film,[n]I'll flip the switch and activate them!

[msg MSG_013 [Morgana]]
Now, which projector should we start[n]with? We'll leave it up to you, Joker.
