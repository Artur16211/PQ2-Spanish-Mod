[msg MSG_000 [Kamoshidaman]]
I've been... so conceited all this time.
I abused my power, believing that[n]oppressing the citizens would benefit[n]the whole of society...
But it's because of this power that I[n]must not mistake the purpose of my[n]authority!

[msg MSG_001 [Kamoshidaman]]
HAHAHA!
The new Kamoshidaman shall never[n]mistreat a troubled citizen again!

[msg MSG_002 [Yosukesaurus]]
Who cares if we've all got different[n]opinions? We just have to talk it out,[n]heart to heart.

[msg MSG_003 [Yosukesaurus]]
Sheesh, everyone's talking all at once.[n]This conversation's going nowhere...
Then again, it's pretty fun to decide[n]how to do things this way.
It really is nice having companions that[n]you can be open with.

[msg MSG_004 [Ribbon]]
I AM... who I am.
I am Ribbon―lover of flowers and[n]everyone in my life...

[msg MSG_005 [Ribbon]]
I think flowers are pleasant... I think[n]flowers are pretty... Everyone feels[n]differently about all sorts of things...
Being different is not erroneous. It[n]proves that I truly am myself...

[msg MSG_006 [High school Hikari]]
I tried to convince myself that I had no[n]choice but to be who everyone wanted me[n]to be...
And I kept watching those distorted[n]movies to make myself forget who I[n]really am inside...
But, I won't run from myself anymore![n]I'll change this movie and get out of[n]here!

[msg MSG_007 [High school Hikari]]
Dad... I swear I'll send you that[n]invitation someday!
