This place seems to have been left[n]intact.

[msg MSG_001 [Naoto]]
Indeed. However, I suspect it's only a[n]matter of time.

[msg MSG_002 [Elizabeth]]
Congratulations, everyone.
My word, that was truly a breathtaking[n]finale. Bravo!

[msg MSG_003 [Morgana]]
M-Miss Elizabeth!? Your clothes are back[n]to normal?

[msg MSG_004 [Theodore]]
The roles we have filled here will be[n]reaching their conclusions quite soon.
More importantly, I must share how[n]impressed I am with you all. You've seen[n]this film festival through to the end.

[msg MSG_005 [Caroline]]
Tell me about it... Finally, we can[n]return to our usual duties.

[msg MSG_006 [Justine]]
That's right. We must make up for the[n]lost time...
But for now, I will make a one-time[n]exception and praise you, Inmate: well[n]done.

[sel SEL_007 top]
It wasn't anything special.
I guess it was pretty impressive.
More praise, please.

[msg MSG_008 [Caroline]]
Hmph, a respectable reply... Keep that[n]attitude up while you focus on your[n]rehabilitation, Inmate!

[msg MSG_009 [Caroline]]
Hmph, don't get cocky! Know your place,[n]Inmate!

[msg MSG_010 [Caroline]]
Don't press your luck, Inmate! Even a[n]pig can fly if heated up enough!

[msg MSG_011 [Junpei]]
"E-Even a pig can fly"? Is that supposed[n]to be some kinda threat?

[msg MSG_012 [Akihiko]]
Pork is a source of protein that's[n]chock- full of Vitamin B1. Doesn't that[n]mean she's actually praising him?

[msg MSG_013 [Justine]]
Caroline, isn't the proper expression,[n]"Even a pig can climb a tree if cheered[n]on enough?"

[msg MSG_014 [Caroline]]
Sh-Shut up! You know what I mean!

[msg MSG_015 [Yukari]]
So, can we really, really go home this[n]time?

[msg MSG_016 [Shinjiro]]
How are we doin' that, anyway? There[n]ain't any other exits here.

[msg MSG_017 [Theodore]]
There's no cause for concernâ€•over here,[n]please.
