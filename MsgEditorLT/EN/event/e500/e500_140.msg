No...

[msg MSG_001 [Teddie]]
Why won't the theater people believe us?

[msg MSG_002 [Enlil]]
Do you truly intend to wrench every last[n]person away from this place?
Please understand―that is quite[n]presumptuous of you. After all, these[n]people wish to be here.

[msg MSG_003 [Akihiko]]
That's just...

[msg MSG_004 [Enlil]]
Don't you see? Since there is no end to[n]the salvation here, your actions are[n]wholly meaningless.
This world that I provide them with is[n]the only way they can be saved.

[sel SEL_005 top]
That's not true.
We'll keep trying anyway.

[msg MSG_006 [Morgana]]
Yeah, we decided we're going to save[n]them―you're not talking us out of it!
Let's show everyone that we have the[n]strength to succeed!

[msg MSG_007 [Morgana]]
Right! If we gave up so easily, we'd be[n]disgracing our name as Phantom Thieves!
Let's show everyone that we have the[n]strength to succeed!

[msg MSG_008 [Enlil]]
It seems that any advice I share will[n]only fall on deaf ears.
In that case, I will teach you as many[n]times as necessary... just how foolish[n]you are.

[msg MSG_009 [Haru]]
Eek!?
