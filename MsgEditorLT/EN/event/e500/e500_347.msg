Who cares if we've all got different[n]opinions? We just have to talk it out,[n]heart to heart.

[msg MSG_001 [Yosukesaurus]]
Sheesh, everyone's talking all at once.[n]This conversation's going nowhere...
Then again, it's pretty fun to decide[n]how to do things this way.

It really is nice having companions that[n]you can be open with.
