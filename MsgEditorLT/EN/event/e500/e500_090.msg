Hey, how's everyone holdin' up? You[n]feelin' pooped yet?
C'mooon... Answer meee, Phantom[n]Thiiieves....

[msg MSG_001 [Yusuke]]
Ha, don't underestimate us. This is but―

[msg MSG_002 [Yusuke]]
...Hm. It seems I've grown hungry.

[msg MSG_003 [Morgana]]
Oh boy... No collapsing on us before we[n]deal with Enlil, got it?

[msg MSG_004 [Haru]]
I'm definitely still good to go! How's[n]everyone else doing?

[msg MSG_005 [Ann]]
I'm fine―this is nothing for a phantom[n]thief. How about you, Hikari?

[msg MSG_006 [Hikari]]
I'm okay too. I used to walk around a[n]lot while carrying a pretty heavy[n]camera.

[msg MSG_007 [Ryuji]]
Hmm... Y'know, Hikari, you've had a lot[n]more pep in your step lately.

[msg MSG_008 [Hikari]]
Huh? Wh-What do you mean?

[msg MSG_009 [Ryuji]]
Remember when you told us about what[n]kind of movies you're into?
Ever since you said you like movies that[n]give people hope, you've been totally[n]different than you were when we met.

[msg MSG_010 [Hikari]]
Well, what happened was... I finally[n]remembered the dream ending I want to[n]reach, after putting it into words.

[msg MSG_011 [Ryuji]]
What's your dream?

[sel SEL_012 top]
Being a director?
Being a theater curator?

[msg MSG_013 [Haru]]
Oh, that's right. Hikari-chan did say[n]she's wanted to be a filmmaker ever[n]since she was young.

[msg MSG_014 [Hikari]]
That would be pretty nice, since I'd be[n]surrounded by movies all the time, but[n]what I really want to do is make them.

[msg MSG_015 [Haru]]
Your dream is to become a director, no?[n]You mentioned that you've wanted to be a[n]filmmaker ever since you were young.

[msg MSG_016 [Hikari]]
Mmhm. I've been shooting movies on my[n]own ever since I was a kid because I[n]wanted to become a director...

[msg MSG_017 [Ann]]
Whoa, that's amazing! You shoot your own[n]movies!?

[msg MSG_018 [Hikari]]
It's nothing impressive... I just[n]learned how by watching others do it.

[msg MSG_019 [Makoto]]
There's no need to be modest.
While everyone may have a dream, taking[n]real action to attain it isn't something[n]just anyone can do.

[msg MSG_020 [Yusuke]]
Indeed. So, what sort of movie were you[n]working on before arriving here?

[msg MSG_021 [Hikari]]
I... haven't filmed anything recently. I[n]hit a roadblock, in a way.
I lost sight... of what I wanted to show[n]everyone... and even of who I am.

[msg MSG_022 [Futaba]]
Hikari...

[msg MSG_023 [Hikari]]
But I remember now, thanks to meeting[n]you guys. The movies that I've loved...
And the movies that I really wanted to[n]make... That's why I'm thinking about[n]picking back up where I left off!

[sel SEL_024 top]
I'd love to lend you a hand.
That sounds really great.
Let me star in your first movie.

[msg MSG_025 [Ryuji]]
Me too! We're gonna make Hikari's dream[n]come true, for real!

[msg MSG_026 [Morgana]]
Yeah! I'm certain you can make that[n]dream come true now, Hikari!

[msg MSG_027 [Morgana]]
Hey―no stealing the spotlight, pal! I'm[n]gonna be the star here!

[msg MSG_028 [Ryuji]]
An acting cat? That seems pretty rare.

[msg MSG_029 [Morgana]]
I am NOT an acting cat! I'll do it after[n]I turn back into a human!

[msg MSG_030 [Makoto]]
Oh dear... Let's not start getting[n]ridiculous.
More to the point, I think you're really[n]ready to get out into the world and do[n]this, Hikari-chan. Follow your dream.

[msg MSG_031 [Hikari]]
Thank you, everyone.
I also know... When my first movie is[n]done, I want my dad to watch it.

[msg MSG_031_5 [Hikari]]
I'll definitely give him that screening[n]invitation soon... For real, this time.

[msg MSG_032 [Haru]]
I see... I'm sure that you will.

[msg MSG_033 [Ryuji]]
Hey, so, does that invitation only apply[n]to your dad?

[msg MSG_034 [Hikari]]
Huh?

[msg MSG_035 [Ryuji]]
Well, we wanna see your movie too,[n]right?

[sel SEL_036 top]
Of course.
I'm definitely interested.
May we please watch it too?

[msg MSG_037 [Ann]]
Oh, pretty please? Or would that be[n]asking too much?

[msg MSG_038 [Hikari]]
Oh, no! That's not true! I'd love for[n]you all to watch it!
Will... Will you really come see my[n]movie!?

[msg MSG_039 [Ryuji]]
Of course! I'm totally down!

[msg MSG_040 [Futaba]]
Not just Skull―all the Phantom Thieves[n]will be there!

[msg MSG_041 [Hikari]]
Mmhm! I promise that I'll finish the[n]movie, no matter what it takes!

[msg MSG_042 [Makoto]]
*chuckle* Well, for that to happen, we[n]need to deal with this place first.

[msg MSG_043 [Ryuji]]
Right! Let's take care of business here[n]so Hikari can get to filming back home!
