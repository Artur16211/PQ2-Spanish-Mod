[msg MSG_000 [Hikari]]
No... This again!?

[msg MSG_001 [Yusuke]]
I thought he had disappeared...

[sel SEL_002 top]
Is that really Doe?
That's a phony.

[msg MSG_003 [Akechi]]
He's most likely from a different film[n]than the one we edited.

[msg MSG_004 [Akechi]]
Right. At the very least, he's not the[n]same one that we know.

[msg MSG_005 [P3 Hero]]
I think you're right. Doe was born from[n]Hikari-san's distorted cognition...
But her consciousness has changed[n]already.

[msg MSG_006 [Koromaru]]
Grrrrr...

[msg MSG_007 [Shinjiro]]
So what we're seein' here's the[n]distorted version of the film, huh?

[msg MSG_008 [P4 Hero]]
That would mean the consciousness of the[n]people in the theaters is still[n]distorted...

[msg MSG_009 [Ken]]
If we leave this as it is, everyone will[n]be forced to keep watching that[n]distorted movie, right?

[msg MSG_010 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Then we need to change it. We'll change[n]it as many times as we have to!

[msg MSG_011 [Doe]]
As long as you live, you will face[n]suffering and strife. Oppose others and[n]you will be hurt.
If you don't want to be hurt, discard[n]everything and surrender yourself to[n]this movie.

[msg MSG_012 [Hikari]]
You're wrong! Nobody wants to see a[n]movie like that.
The protagonists in the movies I want to[n]see always get back on their feet, no[n]matter how hurt they end up.

[msg MSG_013 [Doe]]
Isn't this what you wished for? More[n]than anyone else? Just look away and[n]you'll soon be at ease.

[sel SEL_014 top]
That's just avoiding reality.
Yeah, it's easy, but not fun at all.

[msg MSG_015 [Hikari]]
I'll watch the movies that I want to[n]see!

[msg MSG_016 [Doe]]
Ngh... Nngh... Gggghhhh...
If only... you all weren't here...

[msg MSG_017 [Morgana]]
Get ready! Here he comes!
