Why have you remained here? Why do you[n]fight?

[msg MSG_001 [Enlil]]
Ah... Do you still have business with[n]me?

[msg MSG_002 [Shinjiro]]
Yeah, there's somethin' we gotta take[n]care of before we head out.

[msg MSG_003 [Naoto]]
Sorry to trouble you, but we're going to[n]need you to release everyone in the[n]theaters.

[msg MSG_004 [Makoto]]
You told us we could leave, but there's[n]no way we can just abandon the other[n]people here.

[msg MSG_005 [Enlil]]
Hikari-san, your presence can't mean you[n]actually agree with them, could it?
Aren't you just forcing yourself to do[n]this despite how you truly feel because[n]you're following the others?

[msg MSG_006 [Hikari]]
That's not true. I'm here of my own[n]will.

[msg MSG_007 [Enlil]]
*sigh* All this, after I kindly[n]permitted everyone to leave?
Then you can no longer be helped. Allow[n]me to show you a glimpse of the real[n]world...
