Hikari's theater, the projection room...

[msg MSG_001 [Haru]]
Let's see, where are those revised[n]films...
Ooh, here―is this one?

[msg MSG_002 [Kanji]]
We found one too!

[msg MSG_003 [P4 Hero]]
One, two, three, four―no doubt about it,[n]that's all of them.

[msg MSG_004 [Akihiko]]
All we've gotta do now is load the films[n]into those four projectors, right?

[msg MSG_005 [Hikari]]
Mmhm!

[msg MSG_006 [Teddie]]
Then you can leave the rest to us, dear!
Just relax here and wait for us to[n]return bearing the good news!

[msg MSG_007 [Hikari]]
......

[msg MSG_007_5 [Hikari]]
Um, would it be all right if I came[n]along with you?

[msg MSG_008 [Yukiko]]
Huh? But, it'll be dangerous...

[msg MSG_009 [Teddie]]
Could... Could my confidence not be[n]enough for her to believe in us!?

[msg MSG_010 [Yosuke]]
Well, when you're the one saying it,[n]nobody's going to be reassured...
But, kidding aside, won't it be safer[n]for you here in the theater?

[msg MSG_011 [Futaba]]
Th-That's right! We're heading straight[n]into the enemy's main base.
If we run into that lady again, even you[n]could end up getting hurt...

[msg MSG_012 [Hikari]]
That's why I want to go... There's still[n]something I need to tell her in person.

[msg MSG_013 [Rise]]
You mean... you WANT to find Enlil?

[msg MSG_014 [Hikari]]
Mmhm. I know it'll be dangerous. I could[n]very well end up getting in everyone's[n]way out there...
But, I really want to go with you to[n]find Enlil... Please?

[sel SEL_015 top]
Let's find her together.
It's just too dangerous.

[msg MSG_016 [Futaba]]
...If Hikari's this certain, then I'll[n]back you all up with everything I've[n]got.

[msg MSG_016_5 [Futaba]]
B-But don't do anything reckless, okay!?[n]If things get dicey out there, you've[n]gotta book it, posthaste!

[msg MSG_017 [Futaba]]
Honestly, I feel you there...
But, if this is what Hikari really[n]wants... then we should respect her[n]feelings.

[msg MSG_017_5 [Futaba]]
I'll beg on her behalf! Please, take[n]Hikari with you! I'll do my best to back[n]you all up, too!

[msg MSG_018 [Morgana]]
Looks like there's no need to worry. We[n]ought to bring her with us if Futaba[n]says so.
No matter what happens on this mission,[n]we'll be able to protect her.

[msg MSG_019 [Junpei]]
Alright, we've got this! Even if some[n]baddies do show up, we'll just knock 'em[n]out of the park with our Personas!

[msg MSG_020 [Yukari]]
There you go, getting all worked up[n]again. You better not be the one getting[n]knocked out here...

[msg MSG_021 [Hikari]]
Everyone―thank you so much!

[msg MSG_022 [Mitsuru]]
Well then, let's return to the lobby. We[n]should prepare for our mission.
