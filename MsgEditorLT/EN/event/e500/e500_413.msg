...Why won't you surrender yourselves to[n]my salvation?

[msg MSG_001 [P4 Hero]]
Happiness isn't something you leave in[n]someone else's hands. You have to seek[n]it out and attain it yourself.
During that search, you support the[n]people you meet, and vice versa, to find[n]happiness together.

[msg MSG_002 [Enlil]]
When humans interact with one another,[n]each person takes a toll upon the[n]other's heart.
Even if you drive me away, there will be[n]no end to such strife.

[msg MSG_003 [P3 Hero]]
That might be true―the answer we've[n]reached may not always be the right one.
I'm sure there'll be times where we[n]unintentionally hurt others, or end up[n]getting hurt...
But even then, I want my life to be one[n]where I'm content with the conclusion I[n]reach.

[msg MSG_004 [Enlil]]
No matter when or where, a brutal storm[n]brews within humans' hearts.
Yet, you say that you have the resolve[n]to stand your ground, on your own feet?

[sel SEL_005 top]
We absolutely have that resolve.
Don't underestimate us humans.

[msg MSG_006 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Yeah, that's our final answer―right,[n]Hikari-chan?

[msg MSG_007 [Hikari]]
I'm not going to be dependent on you.[n]I'll seize my happiness on my own!

[msg MSG_008 [Enlil]]
......

[msg MSG_009 [Despondent woman's voice]]
You have to seize happiness on your[n]own... Yeah... That's right.

[msg MSG_010 [Listless man's voice]]
Could I... really do that too?

[msg MSG_011 [P3 Hero]]
These voices...

[msg MSG_012 [Upset woman's voice]]
If I can go back, then... I want to try[n]again without giving up.

[msg MSG_013 [Languid man's voice]]
That's right... It's too early for me to[n]give up so easily.

[msg MSG_014 [Listless man's voice]]
I'm leaving here too. I won't let what[n]people think ever bother me again!

[msg MSG_015 [P4 Hero]]
...It looks like we got through to[n]everyone else, too.

[msg MSG_016 [Enlil]]
So, you all choose this path despite the[n]pain it brings... What fools.
