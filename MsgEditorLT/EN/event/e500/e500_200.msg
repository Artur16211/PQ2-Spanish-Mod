Kamoshidaman!? What's HE doing here!?

[sel SEL_001 top]
He's from a different film reel.
It's a rerun.
That's his twin brother.

[msg MSG_002 [Akechi]]
That's most likely the case. He's[n]different from the one in the film we[n]edited.

[msg MSG_003 [Yusuke]]
No, I'm certain we corrected that movie.

[msg MSG_004 [Akechi]]
He's most likely from a different film[n]than the one we edited.

[msg MSG_005 [Ryuji]]
WHAT!? That ain't funny at all!

[msg MSG_006 [Akechi]]
No, this one is most likely from a[n]different film than the one we edited.

[msg MSG_007 [Morgana]]
The first film changed along with[n]Hikari's consciousness...
But the people that are watching now are[n]still trapped in that distorted way of[n]thinking.

[msg MSG_008 [Haru]]
As it is now, everyone will be stuck[n]watching that horrible movie...

[msg MSG_009 [Ryuji]]
Then, we'll just edit it as many times[n]as we gotta!

[msg MSG_010 [Kamoshidaman]]
I am the hero of justice, Kamoshidaman!
I shall punish you undesirable[n]criminals!

[msg MSG_011 [Makoto]]
Undesirable, huh? That may be accurate[n]at the moment...
But we know we're doing the right thing.

[msg MSG_012 [Yusuke]]
We're bringing hope back to the[n]hopeless... It's clear who here is in[n]the right.

[msg MSG_013 [Kamoshidaman]]
Dutifully obeying those of absolute[n]power is what makes one right.
Everyone agrees with my form of justice.[n]Isn't it about time you did as well!?
To find the truth, one must simply[n]follow me!

[msg MSG_014 [Ann]]
So, like, black would be white if you[n]just said so? What are you, stupid?

[msg MSG_015 [Akechi]]
Even children know that such rationale[n]is deeply flawed.

[msg MSG_016 [Kamoshidaman]]
Nothing will change, no matter what you[n]say!
I am the hero of love and peace, feared[n]by allâ€•in other words, I am in the[n]right!
Love and peace: Kamoshidaman![n]HAHAHAHAHA!

[msg MSG_017 [Morgana]]
Hah! You couldn't be more wrong.

[msg MSG_018 [Haru]]
Indeed. By definition, heroes help the[n]weak by standing up to the strong...

[msg MSG_019 [Ryuji]]
Basically, the total effin' opposite of[n]you!

[msg MSG_020 [Kamoshidaman]]
Shut up! You're nothing but a gang of[n]undesirables rebelling against society!

[sel SEL_021 top]
You're the undesirable here.
Come and get us.

[msg MSG_022 [Kamoshidaman]]
Grrrr... It's time for you to grasp the[n]power of justice!

[msg MSG_023 [Futaba]]
Here he comes! Get ready...
