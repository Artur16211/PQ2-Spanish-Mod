Hey, what's HE doing here!?

[sel SEL_001 top]
He's from a different film reel.
It's a rerun.
That's his twin brother.

[msg MSG_002 [Naoto]]
Yes, that must be the case. This one[n]isn't the same as the one in the film we[n]corrected.

[msg MSG_003 [Kanji]]
Huh? Why!? I thought we fixed that[n]thing!

[msg MSG_004 [Naoto]]
This one most likely isn't the same as[n]the one in the film we corrected.

[msg MSG_005 [Yukiko]]
Oh, right... Dinosaurs lay tons of eggs,[n]so it's only natural that there are tons[n]of them with the same face.

[msg MSG_006 [Yosuke]]
Why are you going on about eggs!? Let's[n]just move past this!

[msg MSG_007 [Naoto]]
This one most likely isn't the same as[n]the one in the film we corrected.

[msg MSG_008 [Yosuke]]
Yeah, that's what I thought. I'm pretty[n]sure we changed the herbivores!

[msg MSG_009 [Teddie]]
Then, does that mean the film in the[n]projector is still the unbearable[n]version?
If we don't swap this film out,[n]everyone's gonna keep watching that[n]awful movie...

[msg MSG_010 [P4 Hero]]
If that's the case, then we'll change it[n]as many times as necessary.

[msg MSG_011 [Yosukesaurus]]
Why do you have to keep disturbing the[n]group? Everyone's saying it's going fine[n]the way it is.

[msg MSG_012 [Chie]]
Just because everyone's doing it, that[n]doesn't always make it right!

[msg MSG_013 [Teddie]]
Yeah! If everybody takes off during a[n]red light, it'll obviously cause a huge[n]pile-up!

[msg MSG_014 [Yosukesaurus]]
What? It doesn't matter whether the herd[n]is right or wrong...
It's more important to just take the[n]hint!

[msg MSG_015 [Kanji]]
That ain't takin' any hints! You just[n]don't have the courage to stand up for[n]yourself!

[msg MSG_016 [Yosuke]]
Going with the flow, while you know what[n]you're doing is wrong? That's the lamest[n]you can get!

[msg MSG_017 [Yosukesaurus]]
Whoa, are you for real? You guys[n]seriously can't take a hint!

[sel SEL_018 top]
Hints have nothing to do with it.
You're just hurting my ears.

[msg MSG_019 [Yosukesaurus]]
Ugh, what a pain! If you still don't get[n]it after I've spelled it out for you,[n]then...

[msg MSG_020 [Rise]]
Incoming, Senpai!
