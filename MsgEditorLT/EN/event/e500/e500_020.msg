H-Her hair color changed... on its own?

[msg MSG_001 [Hikari]]
N-Nagi-san!?

[msg MSG_002 [Nagi?]]
*chuckle* No need to be so surprised.

[sel SEL_003 top]
Who are you, really?
Where's Nagi-san?

[msg MSG_004 [Nagi?]]
Please, feel free to instead call me[n]"Enlil."
Nagi can simply be considered one of the[n]many roles I have performed.

[msg MSG_005 [Nagi?]]
She stands before you. Nagi can simply[n]be considered one of the many roles I[n]have performed.
Please, feel free to instead call me[n]"Enlil."

[msg MSG_006 [Yukari]]
Everything about being a curator and[n]wanting to save Hikari-chan―those were[n]all lies too, right?

[msg MSG_007 [Enlil]]
Nothing of the sort, dear. I prepared[n]each of these movie theaters, including[n]Hikari-san's.

[msg MSG_008 [Junpei]]
THAT'S what those are!? They're all over[n]the place!

[msg MSG_009 [Enlil]]
This "place" is my world, given physical[n]form through the collective unconscious[n]of the masses.

[msg MSG_010 [Rise]]
What the... How is this happening!?

[msg MSG_011 [Enlil]]
"I don't know who I really am..." "I[n]don't want others to reject me and hurt[n]me..."
These terrible woes beleaguer the people[n]of your own realities every day... and[n]they are who I am dedicated to save.

[msg MSG_012 [Mitsuru]]
What...?

[msg MSG_013 [Enlil]]
Humans wish to be loosed from the heavy,[n]painful chains of their societies...
That's why, to save them, I curated[n]these movie theaters―rather, I[n]manifested them into existence.
They are to help the people understand[n]the pain that accompanies the assertion[n]of one's individuality.

[msg MSG_014 [Shinjiro]]
Tch... So this was all YOUR doing, then.

[msg MSG_014_5 [Yukari]]
So, you were just being a big phony this[n]whole time while we were fighting for[n]our lives?

[msg MSG_015 [Enlil]]

There's no need to endure that painful[n]life. Giving up one's own thoughts and[n]beliefs can lead to such great harmony.
All anyone must do is simply watch the[n]movies to convince themselves of this[n]fact...
In doing so, they forget their pain,[n]forget their troubles―every one of their[n]cares simply vanishes.

[msg MSG_016 [Makoto]]
That sounds like nothing more than[n]brainwashing!

[msg MSG_017 [Enlil]]
Still, it's what humanity has prayed[n]for. All I've done is provide the people[n]their desired salvation.

[msg MSG_018 [Ryuji]]
Salvation, my ass―you can take your[n]shitty theaters and screw off outta[n]here!

[msg MSG_019 [Akihiko]]
Yeah, do you think we'd just give into[n]your nonsense after that speech? Sorry,[n]but we're outta here―like it or not.

[msg MSG_020 [Enlil]]
Ah... Well, if you wish to return home,[n]then I shan't interfere.

[msg MSG_021 [Kanji]]
Oh yeah!? Well, we're just gonna hafta[n]kick your ass if you won't let us―
...Wait, huh? You mean we can go!?

[msg MSG_022 [Ken]]
Um, I don't understand why...
I mean, you're the one who trapped[n]Hikari-san and the rest of us here.

[msg MSG_023 [Enlil]]
I've understood the decision you have[n]reached. If you wish to leave here, then[n]please, do so.

[sel SEL_024 top]
Are you sure about that?
What's your angle, lady?
Then, don't mind if we do...

[msg MSG_025 [Morgana]]
You moron, stop right there! This is all[n]way too shady!

[msg MSG_026 [Haru]]
Mmhm, no matter how you look at it, her[n]offer's too suspicious... Just what are[n]you up to?

[msg MSG_027 [Enlil]]
Those with strong hearts such as[n]yourselves don't require salvation from[n]their societies, correct?
My protection is for the masses of the[n]weak and struggling...
I will continue protecting the humans[n]who wish to remain in their own movie[n]theaters here.

[msg MSG_028 [P3 Hero]]
There are more people here?

[msg MSG_029 [Enlil]]
I concede that you may have changed[n]Hikari-san's heart so that she now[n]wishes to leave with you...
However, this is like taking but a[n]single grain of sand from an infinite[n]beach.
Even at this very moment, another person[n]wishing to escape their reality has[n]found a theater―and another, now...

[msg MSG_030 [P4 Hero]]
Salvation is nothing but self-serving[n]justification. People don't want to just[n]abandon their individualities like that!

[msg MSG_031 [Enlil]]
*chuckle* Are you so certain?
