What's happening?

[msg MSG_001 [Despondent woman's voice]]
The movie changed...

[msg MSG_002 [Tired schoolgirl's voice]]
Wow...

[msg MSG_003 [Enlil]]
Is this... Hikari-san's movie? But, how?

[msg MSG_004 [Akihiko]]
Sorryâ€•we swapped out all the film in[n]your projectors.

[msg MSG_005 [Enlil]]
When did you manage to...? I admit I'm[n]surprised.

[msg MSG_006 [Teddie]]
It's about time you threw in the towel,[n]lady!

[msg MSG_007 [P3 Fem Protag]]
We're letting everybody out of the[n]theaters! Your scheme is done for!

[msg MSG_008 [Enlil]]
*chuckle* Don't talk such nonsense. Just[n]take a look for yourselves...
Even with your meddling, not a single[n]soul is coming forth to join you.

B-But... I'm still...

[msg MSG_010 [Morose schoolboy's voice]]
I'm still scared to leave...

[msg MSG_011 [Listless man's voice]]
I just don't wanna be hurt anymore...

[msg MSG_012 [Hikari]]
Oh, no...
