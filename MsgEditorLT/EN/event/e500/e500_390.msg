What's this?

[msg MSG_001 [Chie]]
Look! Are they all really leaving their[n]theaters!?

[msg MSG_002 [Yosuke]]
I-It worked! Wow!

[msg MSG_003 [Hikari]]
W-We did it? Did I get through to[n]everybody?

[msg MSG_004 [Yusuke]]
That's right. Your film has moved the[n]people's hearts.

[msg MSG_005 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Yeah! Hikari-chan's message is reaching[n]them!

[msg MSG_006 [Ken]]
Whoa!

[msg MSG_007 [Koromaru]]
Grrrrr...

[msg MSG_008 [Fuuka]]
Look out! I'm sensing incredible power[n]from Enlil!

[msg MSG_009 [Enlil]]
A heart that doesn't give up? That's[n]nothing but an inability to determine[n]one's own limits...
If you thrash upon a bed of nails, isn't[n]it only natural that you become wounded?
Humans, endlessly duplicating their[n]miseries... What a foolish, pathetic[n]existence!

[sel SEL_010 top]
Humans aren't that weak.
Stay out of our business.
Anything is possible for us.

[msg MSG_011 [P4 Hero]]
Yeah, that's right.
No matter how many times we may fail, we[n]can get back up and try again just as[n]often.

[msg MSG_012 [Morgana]]
Well said!

[msg MSG_012_5 [Morgana]]
Even if we fall, we get back on our[n]feet. Take it from a human―that's how we[n]work!

[msg MSG_013 [P3 Fem Protag]]
That's right. If we gave up on[n]everything from the start, there'd be no[n]reason for us to even exist!

[msg MSG_014 [Enlil]]
Oh... Then you'll have to prove it to[n]me.
If you cannot overcome this turmoil,[n]you'll only fall to fate[n]eventually―isn't that true?

[msg MSG_015 [Enlil]]
In that case... show me this power you[n]claim to possess!
