[msg MSG_000 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Look, there they are!

[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
Aha! We finally caught up to the herd!

[msg MSG_002 [Sulky herbivore]]
Hey, those humans are back... Did they[n]follow us?

[msg MSG_003 [Stubborn herbivore]]
No way? I thought we blocked off the[n]path!

[msg MSG_004 [Morgana]]
Heheh! As if we'd give up over such a[n]minor obstacle!

[msg MSG_005 [Timid herbivore]]
But... why are you following us?

[msg MSG_006 [Sulky herbivore]]
Yeah, we don't have anything to do with[n]you anymore.

[msg MSG_007 [Nervous herbivore]]
Let's just ignore the humans and keep[n]moving. Who cares about them? Just as[n]long as we can get to our paradise...

[msg MSG_008 [Kanji]]
H-Hey! Get back here, you bastards!

[msg MSG_009 [Yosukesaurus]]
......

[msg MSG_010 [Yosuke]]
Are you fine with this? You keep[n]suppressing how you really feel...
Are you really satisfied with being the[n]kind of guy to abandon your friends!?

[msg MSG_011 [Yosukesaurus]]
I-I can't help it! This is what everyone[n]voted for!
It's the rule of the herd... If I go[n]against it, I'll be the one kicked out[n]next!
Just... leave me alone!

[msg MSG_012 [Yukiko]]
There they go again.

[msg MSG_013 [Yosuke]]
Sheesh, this again!? We better go too!

[msg MSG_014 [Teddie]]
Yosuke, what is it that's fired you up[n]so much?

[msg MSG_015 [Yosuke]]
Huh!?

[msg MSG_016 [Makoto]]
True, you do seem especially invested[n]when it comes to Yosukesaurus...

[msg MSG_017 [Yosuke]]
Uhh... Right. I guess I was getting a[n]bit heated with him back there.
It's like... I can understand how he[n]feels.

[sel SEL_018 top]
Because you look the same?
Why's that?

[msg MSG_019 [Yosuke]]
Well, I guess that could be part of it.[n]But it's more because he reminds me of[n]how I used to be...

[msg MSG_020 [Yosuke]]
Well, it's not all that interesting or[n]anything...

[msg MSG_021 [Yosuke]]
Growing up, I had to transfer a lot, and[n]transfer students tend to feel isolated[n]when they get to their new school.

[msg MSG_022 [Ann]]
I know what you mean. There are all[n]these established friend groups and[n]cliques, and then you just show up...

[msg MSG_023 [Yosuke]]

If I hadn't done that, I'd be the odd[n]one out, yeah?

[msg MSG_024 [Futaba]]
I know how hard it is to feel alone...
There could be tons of people around[n]you, but you still feel like you stick[n]out like a sore thumb. It can be scary.

[msg MSG_025 [P3 Fem Protag]]
It sure is hard to be alone...

[msg MSG_026 [Yukiko]]
When Yosuke-kun's family first came to[n]Yasoinaba, they were scrutinized pretty[n]badly because of their business...

[msg MSG_027 [Yosuke]]
Yeah―no matter where I went, it was[n]always the same...
I would constantly gauge people's[n]reactions to see if they liked me... All[n]of my relationships felt so phony.
That is, until I met these guys.

[msg MSG_028 [Naoto]]
Yosuke-senpai...

[msg MSG_029 [Yosuke]]
When I started hanging out with them,[n]hiding my personality around them made[n]me feel like I was being an idiot.

[msg MSG_030 [Chie]]
Wait, are you actually paying us a[n]compliment!?

[msg MSG_031 [Yosuke]]
Well, yeah. No matter what others said,[n]you guys didn't immediately judge me,[n]remember?
We talk about our true feelings, and you[n]stop me when I'm about to do something[n]wrong.
Knowing people like that―Knowing friends[n]like that has been life-changing.

[msg MSG_032 [P4 Hero]]
Heh... That's the highest compliment you[n]could give us.

[msg MSG_033 [Rise]]
No way―Yosuke-senpai's actually being[n]real with us!

[msg MSG_034 [Yosuke]]
Oh, c'mon! What's so bad about me[n]spilling my guts for once!?

[msg MSG_035 [Teddie]]
*sniff* You've moved me so greatly that[n]I can hardly bear it, Yosuke...

[msg MSG_036 [Yosuke]]
Argh! Okay, no more of that! I'm gettin'[n]embarrassed here all of a sudden!

[msg MSG_037 [Yukiko]]
Thank you for sharing your feelings with[n]us, Yosuke-kun.

[msg MSG_038 [Yosuke]]
U-Uhh... Well, anyway!
I wanna give Yosukesaurus and the other[n]dinosaurs a piece of my mind!
If they're all really companions, they[n]need to stop worrying about others'[n]reactions and be honest with each other.

[msg MSG_039 [P4 Hero]]
Yeah, we'll find them and tell them[n]exactly that.

[msg MSG_040 [Haru]]
They all share such a strong bond...[n]It's so wonderful to witness.

[msg MSG_041 [Ryuji]]
We better step our game up too― Right,[n]Joker?

[sel SEL_042 top]
We're just as tight as they are.
Let's all work together.

[msg MSG_043 [Morgana]]
That's right. Our bonds are strong as[n]steel!

[msg MSG_044 [Ryuji]]
Hell yeah! Nothing's impossible for the[n]Phantom Thieves!

[msg MSG_045 [Yosuke]]
Well then, let's get going before we[n]lose track of them!

[msg MSG_046 [Futaba]]
We'll do our best to navigate, so you'd[n]better not give up either!
