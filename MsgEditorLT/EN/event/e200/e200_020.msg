Great, another movie that leaves a bad[n]taste in your mouth.

[msg MSG_001 [Futaba]]
Right? It was just the same as it was[n]with Kamoshidaman―like it's making me[n]feel kinda empty inside...

[msg MSG_002 [Makoto]]
It appears to be based on the principle[n]of majority rule.

[msg MSG_003 [Ryuji]]
Whatever most people agree with, huh?[n]That's not really our kinda thing.
I mean, we USED to choose our targets[n]based on their rep in society...

[msg MSG_004 [Haru]]
Ryuji...

[msg MSG_005 [Morgana]]
But now, we know better.
We exact our justice without being[n]influenced by society's whims―that's how[n]the Phantom Thieves do things.

[msg MSG_005_05 [Yusuke]]
Our methods aside―Hikari, is this movie[n]the one that you need to see?

[msg MSG_006 [Hikari]]
...I don't know.

[msg MSG_007 [Akechi]]
How about you, Nagi-san? Do you have any[n]knowledge of this film?

[msg MSG_008 [Nagi]]
No, none whatsoever.

[msg MSG_009 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hm... Hmmm...

[msg MSG_010 [Ann]]
What's up?

[msg MSG_011 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Oh―well, it's not that big a deal...

[msg MSG_011_5 [P3 Fem Protag]]
But, aren't normal dinosaur movies more[n]like―BLAAAAM! Or, something like that...

[msg MSG_012 [Futaba]]
Yeah, yeah!
And they're all like, GRAAAAAAAARH! And[n]KA-BOOOOM!!! Right?

[sel SEL_013 top]
GRAAAAAAAARH?
KA-BOOOOM?
They're also ROOOOOAAAAAAR.

[msg MSG_014 [Futaba]]
Ooh, yeah! And then it's all like,[n]BOOMBOOMBOOMBOOM!!!

[msg MSG_015 [Makoto]]
While I won't comment on the[n]explanation, I get your meaning.
A dinosaur that wants to save her[n]companion, but can't speak up because of[n]the majority opinion...

[msg MSG_016 [Haru]]
Mmhm―how anyone disrupting the peace is[n]evil and everyone constantly worries how[n]others feel and think...
The same could be said about the[n]Kamoshidaman movie too―why are the[n]stories like that?

[msg MSG_017 [Yusuke]]
This doesn't only apply to films, but[n]creators include messages of some kind[n]in their work quite often.
In this case, I suppose the filmmakers[n]are saying, "Cast aside who you are and[n]conform to what everyone else does..."

[msg MSG_018 [Ryuji]]

[msg MSG_019 [Yusuke]]
I agree. No matter what those around me[n]may say, I have no intention of ever[n]giving up on art.

[msg MSG_020 [Haru]]
Then again... I can kind of understand[n]the feeling of having to go along with[n]others...
Had I not met you all, I would've just[n]gone with what my company and the adults[n]demanded of me...

[msg MSG_021 [Hikari]]
Was that movie... that odd?

[msg MSG_022 [Haru]]
Huh? You didn't think anything was off[n]about it?

[msg MSG_023 [Hikari]]
I'm just curious why you're...
Why do you feel so angry... or sad about[n]it?

[msg MSG_024 [Ryuji]]
Deep down, that dinosaur wants to save[n]her bud, but no one's willing to help,[n]so she can't... That's a real bummer.

[msg MSG_025 [Hikari]]
But her companions were opposed to the[n]idea. If they tried to rescue that one,[n]everyone else would be put in danger...

[msg MSG_026 [Morgana]]
Still, it's possible that they could get[n]rescued―then everyone would be safe,[n]right?
I think it's nonsense to make decisions[n]without even trying first.

[msg MSG_027 [Hikari]]
That's...

[msg MSG_028 [Nagi]]
Hikari-san, if you believe the movie[n]should remain as is, then I'm fine with[n]it as well...
However, I'd only support that decision[n]if you truly want it. I don't want you[n]to repress your true self.

[msg MSG_029 [Hikari]]
My... true self? That movie... I...

[sel SEL_030 top]
You're okay with how it is now?
Don't you want a different ending?

[msg MSG_031 [Hikari]]
At first, I thought it was fine as is...[n]But, now...

[msg MSG_032 [Hikari]]
A different ending? I hadn't even[n]thought of that...

[msg MSG_033 [Yusuke]]
Well then, for example―if you were that[n]dinosaur, what would you want to do,[n]Hikari?

[msg MSG_034 [Hikari]]
Me?
......

[msg MSG_034_5 [Hikari]]
But... the other dinosaurs...

[msg MSG_035 [Futaba]]
B-But i-if you lie to your own[n]feelings... I-It'll just make things[n]more painful!
Ah... Um, I mean... That's how I was,[n]so... S-Sorry...

[msg MSG_036 [Hikari]]
Lie...?

[msg MSG_037 [Futaba]]
You saw how Kamoshidaman ended and you[n]were glad how that went, right?
So, um... Basically...

[msg MSG_038 [Hikari]]
If it'll change again... If there's a[n]different ending to this...
I think―I do want to see that...

[msg MSG_039 [Futaba]]
Really!?

[msg MSG_040 [Ryuji]]
Alright! Then, leave it to us!

[msg MSG_040_5 [Ryuji]]
Hey, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]? Let's change this movie,[n]just like the first one!

[sel SEL_041 top]
Yeah.
We need to prioritize our escape.
What does everyone else say?

[msg MSG_042 [Akechi]]
I agree as well.
I believe changing these movies will[n]lead to our escape from here in the end.

[msg MSG_043 [Akechi]]
No, I think that changing these movies[n]will be our fastest way to escape from[n]here.

[msg MSG_044 [Akechi]]
Well, I agree with that plan, at least.
I believe changing these movies will[n]lead to our escape from here in the end.

[msg MSG_045 [Morgana]]
When we changed it, a key came out of[n]Doe... You're banking on the same[n]happening this time too, huh?

[msg MSG_046 [Makoto]]
That pattern hasn't been confirmed yet,[n]but I think it's likely.
Even more so when you consider how Doe[n]is the one playing these bizarre movies.

[msg MSG_047 [Futaba]]
Then that settles that! Let's go explore[n]that movie, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]!
