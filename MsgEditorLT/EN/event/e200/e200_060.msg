Are these... the bones of a dinosaur?

[msg MSG_001 [Ann]]
Why're they on the ground like this!?

[sel SEL_002 top]
It died here.
It got eaten.
It's just a replica.

[msg MSG_003 [Makoto]]
That's true, but the real question is[n]why it died.
It's possible that it died of natural[n]causes... but, there's still the other[n]possibility.

[msg MSG_004 [Ann]]
It got... eaten?
Then, does that mean there's a... hm,[n]something like "trainasaurus rex"―[n]umm...

[msg MSG_005 [Ryuji]]
What kinda thing could've eaten[n]somethin' this... huge?

[msg MSG_006 [Yusuke]]
Well, I could potentially do it if I[n]were hungry.

[msg MSG_007 [Haru]]
Fox's comment aside, a dinosaur that[n]could've eaten something this large[n]would likely be...

[msg MSG_008 [Akechi]]
Still, this looks far too detailed... I[n]think it's safe to say that these are[n]genuine dinosaur bones.

[msg MSG_009 [Makoto]]
But, why are they here? Could this[n]dinosaur have died of natural causes?

[msg MSG_010 [Ann]]
Don't tell me... was it eaten?
Then, does that mean there's a... hm,[n]something like "trainasaurus rex"―[n]umm...

[msg MSG_011 [P3 Fem Protag]]
A Tyrannosaurus rex?
Well, there's no guarantee that's it,[n]but it's definitely possible here!

[msg MSG_012 [Ryuji]]
Oh shit, for real? T-Rexes are the[n]super- strong carnivores, right?

[msg MSG_013 [Yusuke]]
Ah, the most famous of them all...[n]They're an absolute must for a proper[n]dinosaur movie!

[msg MSG_014 [Makoto]]
What are you so excited for?

[msg MSG_015 [Yusuke]]
To witness living dinosaurs with my own[n]two eyes―this is a once-in-a-lifetime[n]opportunity! Of course I'm excited.

[msg MSG_016 [Haru]]
But, it could be another FOE...

[msg MSG_017 [Yusuke]]
That's fine by me. What's important is[n]them being larger than life and full of[n]vivacity!
Ah... I can't wait to see one! If[n]possible, I'd like to sketch it from[n]multiple angles...

[msg MSG_018 [Futaba]]
Hey, Fox... If you're gonna do something[n]reckless, go do it by yourself.
Just ignore that weirdo, and if you feel[n]like you're in danger, come on back,[n]okay?
