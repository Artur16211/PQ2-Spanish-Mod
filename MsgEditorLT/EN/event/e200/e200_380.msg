Junessic Land, Isle's End...

[msg MSG_001 [Kanji]]
We finally caught up with 'em! Hey,[n]dinos!

[msg MSG_002 [Timid herbivore]]
......

[msg MSG_003 [Yosukesaurus]]
......

[msg MSG_004 [Kanji]]
Geez, what's their deal?

[msg MSG_005 [Teddie]]
Hrmm, their bearhavior is quite[n]unusual... Is something wrong?

[msg MSG_006 [Yosukesaurus]]
...It's not here.

[msg MSG_007 [Yosuke]]
Huh? You're all depressed because you[n]lost something?

[msg MSG_008 [Sulky herbivore]]
Of course not. It's the paradise for[n]herbivores... It was all made up!

[msg MSG_009 [Makoto]]
Hold on a moment―this is where your[n]paradise is supposed to be!?

[msg MSG_010 [Yusuke]]
It appears to be an empty, walled-in[n]lot.

[msg MSG_011 [Yosuke]]
Well, did you guys look at the[n]directions again? Maybe this is the[n]wrong place...

[msg MSG_012 [Yosukesaurus]]
I checked the book when we got here![n]This is the exact spot they wrote about!
We've been everywhere on this island,[n]and still haven't found our paradise...

[sel SEL_013 top]
Maybe there's a hidden path.
Did you try the secret password?
I guess it's time to give up.

[msg MSG_014 [Yosuke]]
Yeah, what he said. Maybe there's a[n]hidden passage that takes you somewhere[n]else.

[msg MSG_015 [Chie]]
So there's a secret word that we have to[n]guess? Do we get any hints?

[msg MSG_016 [Yukiko]]
No, Chie―the secret password's always,[n]"open sesame"!

[msg MSG_017 [Akechi]]
Um... Not to rain on your parade, but it[n]seems there isn't anything here for us[n]to provide a password.

[msg MSG_018 [Yosuke]]
What's wrong with you!?

[msg MSG_019 [Rise]]
It's no use... We checked all over the[n]area, but it looks like this is nothing[n]but a dead end.

[msg MSG_020 [Futaba]]
Even when we expanded our range, we[n]didn't see anything like a paradise.

[msg MSG_021 [Loud herbivore]]
What a "paradise" this is... Don't make[n]me laugh! We've been tricked―we've all[n]been had!

[msg MSG_022 [Sulky herbivore]]
...Aren't you the one who sold us on[n]this "quest"?

[msg MSG_023 [Yosukesaurus]]
Wha―Me!?
But, all I did was read about it in some[n]human book...!

[msg MSG_024 [Sulky herbivore]]
You dragged us all into this mess, and[n]now you're trying to pass the blame!?

[msg MSG_025 [Yosukesaurus]]
None of you exactly shot down the idea![n]You said, "If there's a paradise for us,[n]we'll go!"
That's why we've all been risking our[n]lives to―

[msg MSG_026 [Stubborn herbivore]]
That's right! The life of the entire[n]herd is at risk out here, and it's your[n]fault!

[msg MSG_027 [Yosukesaurus]]
But that's―That's because I thought it'd[n]be best for us...

[msg MSG_028 [Sulky herbivore]]
Let's begin the vote!
All those who believe it's his fault[n]that we were put in danger, raise your[n]hand!

[msg MSG_029 [Nervous herbivore]]
So, uh... How should we vote?

[msg MSG_030 [Timid herbivore]]
I-If you're all saying it's his fault...[n]then I guess I think so, too...

[msg MSG_031 [Yosukesaurus]]
No... But I―You gotta hear me out!

[msg MSG_032 [Sulky herbivore]]
Looks like it's unanimous. So...
All those who think we should kick him[n]out for endangering the herd, raise your[n]hand!

[msg MSG_033 [Loud herbivore]]
Yeah!

[msg MSG_034 [Nervous herbivore]]
Yes.

[msg MSG_035 [Timid herbivore]]
...Y-Yes.

[msg MSG_036 [Yosukesaurus]]
W-Wait a sec!
If you all kick me out... what am I[n]supposed to do!?

[msg MSG_037 [Loud herbivore]]
This herd has always followed the[n]majority rule. Don't you remember?

[msg MSG_038 [Nervous herbivore]]
Wh-When we were attacked by that[n]carnivore, you went along with the vote[n]that time...
And... this isn't any different...[n]right?

[msg MSG_039 [Yosukesaurus]]
......!

[msg MSG_040 [Ryuji]]
Back off the guy! What're you all[n]baggin' on him for, anyways!?

[msg MSG_041 [P4 Hero]]
I can't believe this... There's no way[n]this is how they should handle their[n]problems.

[sel SEL_042 top]
We need to intervene.
This is wrong.
Let's just leave them be.

[msg MSG_043 [Yosuke]]
Yeah, let's hurry up and stop them―he's[n]about to get kicked outta the herd!

[msg MSG_044 [Naoto]]
I agree with Joker―let's jump in and put[n]a stop to this!

[msg MSG_045 [Yosuke]]
A-Are you kidding?
Sorry, but... I just can't ignore this!

[msg MSG_046 [Yosuke]]
Hang on a second! Aren't you guys all[n]part of the same group?
All you're doing is voting based on what[n]others might think―THAT'S how you decide[n]your majority rule!?

[msg MSG_047 [Timid herbivore]]
W-Well...

[msg MSG_048 [Sulky herbivore]]
We're defenseless prey! We'll never[n]survive if we don't stick together and[n]act together!

[msg MSG_049 [Loud herbivore]]
Can you even understand what it feels[n]like to live in constant fear of[n]carnivores?
Those who behave selfishly need to be[n]kicked out. That's the only way we can[n]survive!

[msg MSG_050 [Naoto]]
We understand what you're saying...
However, you are capable of more methods[n]of self-preservation besides casting out[n]your troublemakers.
Wouldn't it be better to choose a means[n]of survival in which no one is[n]sacrificed?

[msg MSG_051 [Loud herbivore]]
Okay, and what means are those!?
It's not like we want to do it... This[n]is the only way we can protect[n]ourselves!

[msg MSG_052 [Sulky herbivore]]
Y-Yeah! If we obey the majority[n]decision, then we know we've done the[n]right thing!

[msg MSG_053 [Nervous herbivore]]
A-Also... weren't you pretty friendly[n]with those humans?
All this happened because you believed[n]in a human book, too...

[msg MSG_054 [Yosukesaurus]]
I... I didn't mean for this to happen!

[msg MSG_055 [Loud herbivore]]
That doesn't matter―it's already[n]decided. We took a vote, and the[n]majority says to kick you out.

[msg MSG_056 [Yosukesaurus]]
N-No, please! I don't wanna be alone...

[msg MSG_057 [Sulky herbivore]]
If you're so adamant on not being kicked[n]out, then prove that you're really on[n]our side here!

[msg MSG_058 [Loud herbivore]]
Humans are the ones who deceived us into[n]coming here, with that awful book!
If you're of the same opinion, then[n]shouldn't you be able to make those[n]humans there pay for it!?

[msg MSG_059 [Yosukesaurus]]
Wha―Make them... make them pay!?

[msg MSG_060 [Ann]]
Hey, where'd you get that idea!? That[n]book has nothing to do with us!

[msg MSG_061 [Sulky herbivore]]
If you want to rejoin our herd, you have[n]to prove that you fit in with us!

[msg MSG_062 [Yosuke]]
Dammit, this is so stupid!

[msg MSG_063 [Yosukesaurus]]
I... I, ah...

[msg MSG_064 [Morgana]]
Hey, keep it together―don't just make[n]yourself agree with them!

[msg MSG_065 [Yosukesaurus]]
No... I don't wanna be abandoned...
I didn't do anything wrong! It's― It's[n]all because you humans went and stuck[n]your stupid noses into this!
