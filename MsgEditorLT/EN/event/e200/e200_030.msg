Whoooa, this is amazing! Where are we!?

This is like a real jungle... I swear,[n]some ferocious dinosaur could pop out at[n]any moment.

[msg MSG_003 [Akechi]]
In "Kamoshidaman," the characters that[n]were in the trailer appeared just as we[n]saw them...
It naturally follows that dinosaurs will[n]appear in this movie.

[sel SEL_004 top]
That's just unbelievable.
I'm getting psyched.
Raaaargh!

[msg MSG_005 [Makoto]]
Seriously. Well, it can't be helped if[n]one shows up.
Let's just be sure to move with caution[n]and stay on guard to deal with anything[n]that could happen.

[msg MSG_006 [Ann]]
What!? Are you planning on chasing down[n]dinosaurs or something? Seriously,[n]please don't...

[msg MSG_007 [Makoto]]
Let's just be sure to move with caution[n]and stay on guard to deal with anything[n]that could happen.

[msg MSG_008 [Ann]]
Wha―!?
H-Hey! That's not funny, you know!

[msg MSG_009 [Makoto]]
Oh, dear. Quit fooling around...
But, now that I think of it―we should[n]remain cautious here, just in case we're[n]suddenly attacked by something.

[msg MSG_010 [Yusuke]]
...By the way, I know we intend to[n]change this movie, but what exactly are[n]we supposed to do here?

[msg MSG_011 [Ryuji]]
It was pretty easy to figure out with[n]Kamoshidaman―all we had to do was beat[n]up the bad guy.

[msg MSG_012 [Akechi]]
Hmm... I'm not so sure it was as simple[n]as that...

[msg MSG_013 [Morgana]]
Crow?

[msg MSG_014 [Akechi]]
Oh, I'm sorry... I was just talking to[n]myself.
At any rate, perhaps the dinosaurs from[n]the trailer are key to changing this[n]movie...

[msg MSG_015 [Makoto]]
The ones who were deciding things via[n]majority rule, yes?

[msg MSG_016 [Akechi]]
According to the trailer, the dinosaurs[n]seemed to be arguing about whether or[n]not to save their companion.

[msg MSG_016_5 [Akechi]]
The one who insisted on the rescue was[n]spurned by the others for dissenting[n]from the group...
If we're to change anything, wouldn't[n]that be the most likely place to begin?

[sel SEL_017 top]
You're right.
I guess we can give it a try.

[msg MSG_018 [Yusuke]]
Indeed―we have no other clues, anyhow.[n]Why don't we look for those dinosaurs?

[msg MSG_019 [Makoto]]
I agree, let's start with what we can[n]do.

[msg MSG_020 [Futaba]]
Hmm... Seems like this place gets pretty[n]complicated the further in you go...
Joker―make sure you keep up the map[n]drawing, just in case something comes[n]up!
