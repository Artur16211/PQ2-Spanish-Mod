Great! It really was a key to this door!

[msg MSG_001 [Kanji]]
Hell yeah! One more step closer to[n]gettin' outta here... right?

[msg MSG_002 [Chie]]
I... think?

[msg MSG_003 [Haru]]
Um, there is one thing that I'm curious[n]about: didn't Doe seem much calmer than[n]he did before?
The first time that he produced a key,[n]he seemed to be in much more pain than[n]he did this time around.

[msg MSG_004 [Yusuke]]
Hm, now that you mention it... The[n]difference seems rather slight, though.

[msg MSG_005 [Naoto]]
I see what you mean... Perhaps our edits[n]of the movies are affecting him.

[msg MSG_006 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Are you feeling better now, Hikari-chan?[n]You were shaking a lot earlier...

[msg MSG_007 [Hikari]]
M-Mmhm... Sorry, I'm okay.

[msg MSG_008 [Akechi]]
Hikari-san seems to become extremely[n]nervous in Doe's presence.

[msg MSG_009 [Chie]]
Hello!? Makes sense to me!

[msg MSG_010 [Yukiko]]
I wonder... Would something pop out of[n]him if we ripped his head off, like how[n]Teddie works?

[msg MSG_011 [Teddie]]
I just felt a shiver ripple down my[n]spine...

[msg MSG_012 [Hikari]]
*giggle*

[msg MSG_013 [P4 Hero]]
I'm glad to see that you're starting to[n]get back into better spirits.

[msg MSG_014 [Ryuji]]
Welp, no need to fear! We swear we're[n]gettin' you outta here!

[msg MSG_015 [Yosuke]]
Yeah, what he said―just leave this to[n]us. You figure out what you want to do[n]when you get back home.

[msg MSG_016 [Hikari]]
Huh? What I want to do...?

[msg MSG_017 [Futaba]]
My recommendation is the Featherman[n]crane game―it's only found in Akiba!

[msg MSG_017_5 [Futaba]]
The key to victory lies with the arm's[n]strength, but you also have to check the[n]width of the claws when open!

[msg MSG_018 [Makoto]]
You really do love that game, don't you,[n]Futaba...? Well, if it gets you out of[n]the house, that's for the best.

[msg MSG_019 [Morgana]]
There it is―we've got a new movie.

[msg MSG_020 [Theater intercom]]
We have an announcement for our[n]customers.
A new movie will begin showing in[n]Theater 3 momentarily. I repeat...

[msg MSG_021 [Ryuji]]
Tch... Great, a new movie. I bet it's[n]just as shitty as the last two were.

[msg MSG_022 [P4 Hero]]
Well, there's nothing else we can do to[n]get out of this place... Let's go,.
