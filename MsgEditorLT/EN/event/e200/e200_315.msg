Please, wait a moment.

[msg MSG_001 [P4 Hero]]
Elizabeth...?

[sel SEL_002 top]
What's up?
Is something the matter?

[msg MSG_003 [Elizabeth]]
Hm...
Hm, hm, hm...

[msg MSG_004 [P4 Hero]]
......?

[msg MSG_005 [Elizabeth]]
My, how rude of me...
I've inadvertently sensed a new "bond"[n]developing between you two.

[msg MSG_006 [P4 Hero]]
...You mean [f 6 1 30 0 0 0] and me?

[msg MSG_007 [Elizabeth]]
But, how could this be? Perhaps...[n]because this meeting normally wouldn't[n]be possible?
Whatever the case, this is truly[n]fascinating...

[msg MSG_008 [Yosuke]]
A bond, already? That's a bit suddenâ€• do[n]you guys feel anything like that?

[sel SEL_009 top]
Actually, yes.
I don't know...

[msg MSG_010 [Ryuji]]
I got an idea on what it is...
Back in the movie, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0] and teamed up[n]and did this insane attack!

[sel SEL_011 top]
When we stalled that dinosaur...
Oh yeah, I forgot about that.

[msg MSG_012 [P4 Hero]]
True, even I was surprised by how[n]smoothly I was moving...
My body somehow seemed lighter, and I[n]could feel the energy rising in me...
That's how we were able to make that[n]carnivore flinch with just one attack.

[msg MSG_013 [Yosuke]]
For real!? That's so strong!

[msg MSG_014 [P4 Hero]]
But, why would something like this[n]happen now, of all times?

[msg MSG_015 [Elizabeth]]
Everyone gained the ability to wield[n]multiple Personas due to those with the[n]power of the wild card meeting here...
So, this awakening to a power through[n]bonds could be a phenomenon specific to[n]this world as well.

[msg MSG_016 [P4 Hero]]
We coordinated our attack back then just[n]by chance, but if we could do that[n]whenever we wanted...

[msg MSG_017 [Elizabeth]]
So, why not further develop such bonds?

[sel SEL_018 top]
What do you mean?
How do we do that?

[msg MSG_019 [Elizabeth]]
Rather than explain it through words, it[n]would be best for you to experience it[n]firsthand...
There just so happens to be a relevant[n]special screening for this occasion.
By deepening the bonds amongst[n]yourselves, I suspect it will give rise[n]to additional powers...
If you have the time, I'd most fervently[n]like for you to come by the box office[n]so we may investigate this further.
With that taken care of, please excuse[n]me...

[msg MSG_020]
After completing certain quests, you[n]will acquire "Unison Skills."
Unison Skills are powerful attacks[n]performed by Persona-users who have[n]deepened their bonds with each other.
These will be useful for your efforts[n]within the movies, so be sure to make[n]good use of them.
