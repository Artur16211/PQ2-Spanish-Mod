[msg MSG_000 [Yosuke]]
Alright! Is it just me, or did we nail[n]that!?

[msg MSG_001 [Rise]]
You sure did! Everyone had such happy[n]smiles in the end!

[msg MSG_002 [Hikari]]
Welcome back, everyone.

[msg MSG_003 [Ann]]
Thanks! Did you make sure to watch the[n]whole movie to the end?

[msg MSG_004 [Hikari]]
Mmhm, I did.

[msg MSG_005 [Futaba]]
H-Hey, Hikari―what did you think of it?

[msg MSG_006 [Hikari]]
Um...

[msg MSG_007 [Nagi]]
It's all right... You can tell them how[n]you truly felt, in your own words.

[msg MSG_008 [Hikari]]
Mm... Well...
The movie was really... wonderful.

[msg MSG_009 [Futaba]]
F-For real!?

[msg MSG_010 [Hikari]]
Mmhm... For real.

[msg MSG_011 [Futaba]]
I see. I'm glad to hear that...

[msg MSG_012 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hey, Hikari-chan―what did you like about[n]it?

[msg MSG_013 [Hikari]]
He stood up to the carnivore... Even[n]though he was on his own...
Everyone else was against the idea,[n]but... he summoned the courage to do[n]it...

[msg MSG_014 [Futaba]]
You mean Yosukesaurus, yeah? And? And?

[msg MSG_015 [Hikari]]
And then, the other herbivores were[n]really scared... but they also found[n]their courage.
He acted on how he truly felt... but he[n]wasn't left alone because of it...

[msg MSG_016 [Yosuke]]
That's because friends can say what[n]they're really feeling―right, partner?

[msg MSG_017 [P4 Hero]]
Right.

[msg MSG_018 [Hikari]]
Up until now, I thought that I had to go[n]along with what my friends did and said.
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to be with[n]them... I thought it was only natural to[n]go along with the crowd...
But, that wasn't true. It's exactly like[n]you said, Futaba-chan...

[msg MSG_019 [Futaba]]
Hikari, did... did you just call me by[n]my name?

[msg MSG_020 [Nagi]]
Just as with the previous movie, the[n]ending to which you guided this film was[n]simply magnificent.

[msg MSG_021 [Hikari]]
You thought so too, Nagi-san?

[msg MSG_022 [Nagi]]
Yes. Violence by numbers always occurs[n]when living in a group...
I can only surmise that many individuals[n]must have been mistreated in that movie[n]until you all entered and altered it.
It's undeniable that such issues may[n]also take place within the world we[n]know...

[msg MSG_023 [Hikari]]
......

[msg MSG_024 [Nagi]]
However, thanks to all of you, we were[n]able to witness a new outcome today.
Just as Hikari-san and the dinosaurs[n]that appeared in that movie felt... I[n]too feel overjoyed.
Please allow me to express my gratitude[n]as well...
Thank you so much for that wonderful[n]movie.

[sel SEL_025 top]
We just did what we always do.
There's no need for thanks.
Of course we crushed it.

[msg MSG_026 [Chie]]
Aw man, he just treated that whole[n]nightmare like it was a piece of cake!

[msg MSG_027 [Teddie]]
*whistle* So cool!

[msg MSG_028 [Morgana]]
Man, what a show-off...
Then again, we really did crush it in[n]there!

[msg MSG_029 [Doe]]
......

[msg MSG_030 [Chie]]
Aaaaaaah!? Man, you surprised me!

[msg MSG_031 [P4 Hero]]
Doe...

[msg MSG_032 [P4 Hero]]
So, that's Doe...

[msg MSG_033 [Doe]]
Nghh... Nnnnghhh...

[msg MSG_034 [Haru]]
His expression... Is he about to produce[n]another key!?

[msg MSG_035 [Hikari]]
A-Ah...

[msg MSG_036 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hikari-chan, come here!

[msg MSG_037 [Doe]]
Ngh... Nghhhhh!

[msg MSG_038 [Yosuke]]
Wha―! I know you told me about this, but[n]did a key really just pour out of his[n]eyes!?

[msg MSG_039 [Yukiko]]
Could it be a key to the front door?

[msg MSG_040 [Naoto]]
Yes, I believe it's the second one.[n]Let's give it a try.
