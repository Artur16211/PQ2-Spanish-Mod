This island seems to be quite large.

[msg MSG_001 [Makoto]]
True... It may have been necessary,[n]considering how large dinosaurs often[n]are.

[msg MSG_002 [Futaba]]
...Hm? Hmmm?

[msg MSG_003 [Makoto]]
What's the matter, Oracle? Did you find[n]something?

[msg MSG_004 [Futaba]]
Well... I'm getting readings of[n]something here that's a lot stronger[n]than the ones from earlier...

[msg MSG_005 [Yusuke]]
Are they FOEs?

[msg MSG_006 [Haru]]
Oh no, could they actually be the[n]T-Rexes that we were discussing a moment[n]ago!?

[msg MSG_007 [Ryuji]]
Holy shit... Just hearin' it could be a[n]T-Rex is one thing, but them being FOEs[n]is even more insane.

[sel SEL_008 top]
It's insane all right.
We'll be fine.
Let's run.

[msg MSG_009 [Ryuji]]
Right? Those guys are classic movie[n]monsters.
Like, a ferocious T-Rex chompin' down[n]headfirst on whoever's runnin' away from[n]it...

[msg MSG_010 [Morgana]]
Sheesh, are you all seriously freaking[n]out?

[msg MSG_011 [Ryuji]]
Oh, but we've got a tasty lookin' cat[n]here―maybe he'll be the first course.

[msg MSG_012 [Morgana]]
N-Noooo―wait, I mean, I'm not tasty! OR[n]a cat!

[msg MSG_013 [Ryuji]]
You say that, but those guys are classic[n]movie monsters.
Like, a ferocious T-Rex chompin' down[n]headfirst on whoever's runnin' away from[n]it...

[msg MSG_014 [Morgana]]
What's this? Are you freaking out,[n]Skull?

[msg MSG_015 [Ryuji]]
Oh, but we've got a tasty lookin' cat[n]here―maybe he'll be the first course.

[msg MSG_016 [Morgana]]
N-Noooo―wait, I mean, I'm not tasty! OR[n]a cat!

[msg MSG_017 [Ryuji]]
Wait a sec, there!
If you start runnin' from a T-Rex right[n]away, you're just gonna end up in even[n]more danger!

[msg MSG_018 [Akechi]]
Ah, the classic movie clich〒... The[n]first to flee is the first to be eaten.

[msg MSG_019 [P3 Fem Protag]]
It's true that carnivorous dinosaurs are[n]dreadful... but I'm sure we'll be okay[n]if we all stick together!

[msg MSG_020 [Haru]]
Mmhm! If worse comes to worst, I'll chop[n]it in half with my axe!

[msg MSG_021 [Ann]]
Ahaha, then I'll roast it alive with my[n]hottest flames!

[msg MSG_022 [Makoto]]
I wonder if its eyes are a weak point. I[n]could try striking there to test it out.

[msg MSG_023 [Morgana]]
I-I feel like the girls are more[n]courageous than us...

[msg MSG_024 [Ryuji]]
We can't let 'em show us up here...[n]Let's step up our game too, Joker!
