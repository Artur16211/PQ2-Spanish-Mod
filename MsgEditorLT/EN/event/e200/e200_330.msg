Hey, so... Even if we find those[n]herbivores again, is it gonna do us any[n]good?

[msg MSG_001 [P3 Fem Protag]]
You mean, are they actually going to[n]listen to what we have to say?

[msg MSG_002 [Ann]]
Yeah―like, they seemed pretty mad at us.[n]They even kicked us out of their group.

[msg MSG_003 [Naoto]]
They believe that majority rule has kept[n]them alive in this world...

[msg MSG_003_5 [Naoto]]
I can understand why they couldn't[n]forgive us for taking their methods of[n]survival so lightly.

[msg MSG_004 [Ryuji]]
But, if we're gonna change this movie...
Won't it be impossible unless we change[n]that kinda thinking?

[msg MSG_005 [Chie]]
*sigh* How are we gonna do that, though?[n]Should we grill up some nice steaks to[n]try to win them over?

[msg MSG_006 [Yosuke]]
That'd only work on you, Chie. Those[n]guys are herbivores, anyhow!

[msg MSG_007 [P4 Hero]]
They didn't seem all that receptive to[n]persuasion, either. We need a way to[n]change their minds...

[msg MSG_008 [Yusuke]]
Those dinosaurs are quite the mystery...[n]Why are they so adamant on denying[n]alternative possibilities?

[msg MSG_009 [Haru]]
...I think it's due to the fact that[n]they're all scared.

[sel SEL_010 top]
Scared?
I think I get it.
Even though they're dinosaurs?

[msg MSG_013 [Haru]]
Well, the size of their bodies and the[n]strength of their hearts are separate[n]matters...
I guess you could say they'd rather go[n]with the flow. They're scared to break[n]away from the crowd and stand out.

[msg MSG_014 [P3 Fem Protag]]
That's true―having to follow the crowd,[n]getting expectations and labels shoved[n]onto you...
Resisting that kind of stuff takes a lot[n]out of you and really beats you down[n]over time.

[msg MSG_015 [Kanji]]
Ohhh, I getcha...

[msg MSG_016 [Makoto]]
Going along with the crowd is much[n]easier, and you don't have to take[n]responsibility for any outcomes.
That was the same approach to[n]problem-solving as the last movie.

[msg MSG_017 [Naoto]]
Using majority rule to make decisions[n]isn't necessarily wrong...
But, being unable to even speak your own[n]mind, solely because you're in the[n]minority? That's just...

[sel SEL_018 top]
It's unfair.
It's suffocating.
It's boring.

[msg MSG_019 [Yukiko]]
Mmhm. Different opinions should be[n]welcomed, regardless of numbers.

[msg MSG_020 [Ryuji]]
Right!? Having your opinion shut down[n]all because it's different from others[n]is just the effin' worst...
Of course different people are gonna[n]have different opinions!

[msg MSG_021 [Yusuke]]
Indeed. If everyone were to adhere to[n]the same methods and beliefs, nothing[n]new would ever arise.
Diversity should be more valued.

[msg MSG_022 [P4 Hero]]
Yeah―like how we're all companions, but[n]each one of us has a different way of[n]thinking and feeling about things...
But, if we all talked it out properly, I[n]know we'd be able to reach the best[n]solution.

[msg MSG_023 [Yosuke]]
Being able to say what's on your mind,[n]even though it might go over badly...
I guess that's just a kind of courage[n]those dinosaurs don't have.

[msg MSG_024 [Teddie]]
Yosukesaurus looked so troubled when the[n]herd was voting...
I think, deep down, he didn't really[n]want to kick us out.

[msg MSG_025 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Yeah, he was definitely hesitant. In the[n]end there, it seemed like he had to[n]really convince himself to fall in line.

[msg MSG_026 [Morgana]]
So, he didn't have the courage to take[n]that one small step...

[msg MSG_027 [Morgana]]
Mrow-ow-ow!?

[msg MSG_028 [Chie]]
Whoa, that scared the crap out of me...[n]What WAS that, anyway!?

[msg MSG_029 [Akechi]]
It sounded like something large falling[n]down nearby. We should investigate,[n]Joker.
