[msg MSG_000 [Morgana]]
Whew... We made it back safe! Is[n]everyone still with us?

[msg MSG_001 [Energetic girl]]
Whoa, daaaamn! This really, seriously is[n]a movie theater!

[msg MSG_002 [Reserved girl]]
This is unbelievable... Where'd the[n]forest go? The island? The ammonites!?

[msg MSG_003 [Energetic girl]]
Uh, no one cares about the ammonites.[n]They're creepy. They have too many legs.

[msg MSG_004 [Futaba]]
W-Whoaaa... More Persona-users... Our[n]lineup's expanding so fast... Like dried[n]seaweed in soup...

[msg MSG_005 [Intelligent-looking boy]]
Um... May I ask something? When did you[n]change into those clothes!?

[msg MSG_006 [Person in bear costume]]
Whoaaaaa! You're like super-duper-[n]surprising illusionists!

[msg MSG_007 [Ryuji]]
Ohhh, this... It's a long story. We'll[n]get into that later.
You got someone with you who's really[n]sick, right?

[msg MSG_008 [Composed boy]]
Yeah. Is there a place where she can[n]rest?

[msg MSG_009 [Hikari]]
...Is she okay?

[msg MSG_010 [Composed boy]]
And you are?

[msg MSG_011 [Makoto]]
She's Hikari-chan.
She seems to have been trapped in this[n]world just like we were.
And this over here is...

[msg MSG_012 [Nagi]]
It's nice to make your acquaintance. I[n]am the curator of this movie theater.[n]Please call me Nagi.
We've seen the circumstances that led up[n]to now. Your associate requires[n]immediate treatment.

[msg MSG_013 [Hikari]]
Nagi-san, is there any medicine here?[n]Also, a blanket and somewhere for her to[n]lie down...

[msg MSG_014 [Person in bear costume]]
*sniffle* You're so nice, Hikarin...!
But it seems like normal antidotes won't[n]work on Rise-chan... What are we gonna[n]doooo!?

[sel SEL_015 top]
We'll save her―no matter what.
Don't lose heart.
We'll do what we can.

[msg MSG_016 [Menacing-looking boy]]
Dude, you guys are nice, even though we[n]just met'n'all...

[msg MSG_017 [Intelligent-looking boy]]
Thank you. And we shouldn't get shaken[n]up... We need to stay calm.

[msg MSG_018 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I've only known everyone for a short[n]while, but they're all really reliable[n]people.
Plus, it's only natural to help each[n]other out―especially at a time like[n]this.

[msg MSG_019 [Composed boy]]
Thanks, everyone. It's a huge relief―

[msg MSG_020 [Woman in blue]]
However, if she's been afflicted with[n]poison, she'll require a specific[n]antidote.
We'll do all we can to help. Won't you[n]carry her over here?

[msg MSG_021 [Menacing-looking boy]]
Ooh, that'd be great.

[msg MSG_022 [Menacing-looking boy]]
Wait, what the―!? Who're you!?

[msg MSG_023 [Composed boy]]
You're here too, Margaret...

[msg MSG_024 [Girl in a punk outfit]]
...Me too.

[msg MSG_025 [Energetic girl]]
Even you, Marie-chan!? What are you[n]doing here!?

[msg MSG_026 [Girl in a punk outfit]]
Dunno... I was with Margaret when I[n]ended up here.

[msg MSG_027 [Ann]]
No way! Even more people!?
I mean, who's that? Do you know her,?

[sel SEL_028 top]
She looks somewhat familiar.
I don't have a clue.
She's insanely hot.

[msg MSG_029 [Haru]]
Really? You have quite the large circle[n]of acquaintances.

[msg MSG_030 [Yusuke]]
...Although, isn't he just referring to[n]that woman in blue we met earlier?

[msg MSG_031 [Makoto]]
But, those blue clothes... Could she be[n]related to the others?

[msg MSG_032 [Morgana]]
Hey, enough with the gawking.
Welp, there's being a guy for you... My[n]eyes are solely for Lady Ann, though!

[msg MSG_033 [Woman in blue]]
Fate of some kind must have summoned us[n]here... After all, nothing unnecessary[n]happens with us.

[msg MSG_034 [Ryuji]]
So, uh... who are you?

[msg MSG_035 [Woman in blue]]
Ah, please excuse my rudeness.
It's nice to meet you all. My name is[n]Margaret.
I provide aid to this young gentleman[n]here.
I'm pleased to make your acquaintance.

[msg MSG_036 [Girl in a punk outfit]]
...What about me?

[msg MSG_037 [Margaret]]
Introduce yourself.

[msg MSG_038 [Marie]]
...I'm Marie.

[sel SEL_039 top]
...That's all you've got?
Nice to meet you.
Are you a Velvet Room resident?

[msg MSG_040 [Marie]]
Wha―!? What else am I supposed to say?
I mean, I was suddenly brought here too.[n]None of this makes any sense to me!

[msg MSG_041 [Marie]]
Oh... Uh, same here...
I mean... I was just brought here all of[n]a sudden, and none of this is making any[n]sense to me.

[msg MSG_042 [Marie]]
No. I just happen to hang around there.
But, I was suddenly brought here and...[n]This just doesn't make any sense!

[msg MSG_043 [Margaret]]
In any case, neutralizing her poison is[n]more important. I shall prepare the[n]medicine for her.

[msg MSG_044 [Intelligent-looking boy]]
Really? Thank you, that'd be most[n]helpful.

[msg MSG_045 [Nagi]]
Please leave the rest to us. I will[n]provide my aid as well.

[msg MSG_046 [Hikari]]
I'll help too...

[msg MSG_047 [Nagi]]
Thank you, Hikari-san.

[msg MSG_047_5 [Nagi]]
I'm sure you are all exhausted, so[n]please, rest here for a while.

[msg MSG_048 [Margaret]]
Indeed, why not ascertain this situation[n]you have all found yourselves in during[n]this time?
We will return once the medicine has[n]been prepared.

[msg MSG_049 [Marie]]
I'm coming too...

[msg MSG_050 [Composed boy]]
All right. We'll wait for your return.
