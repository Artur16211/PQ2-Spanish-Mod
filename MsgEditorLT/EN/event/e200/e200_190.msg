[msg MSG_000 [Dinosaur with headphones]]
I-I've been saved... Thank you so much!

[msg MSG_001 [P4 Hero]]
That was a close one. Are you hurt?

[msg MSG_002 [Dinosaur with headphones]]
Nope―all good, partner!

[msg MSG_003 [Chie]]
He... He just called [f 6 1 13 0 0 0]-kun partner?[n]Could this guy really be Yosuke?

[msg MSG_004 [Teddie]]
Well, his silly face and vibe definitely[n]scream "Yosuke"...
But, on the other paw, something about[n]him just seems off...

[msg MSG_005 [Dinosaur with headphones]]
Wh-Why are you guys staring at me? Is[n]there something on my face?
Y'know, I've never actually seen anyone[n]like you before! Are you some new type[n]of small dinosaur?

[msg MSG_006 [Makoto]]
Um... We're human.

[msg MSG_007 [Dinosaur with headphones]]
Wait, human... Wait! HUMAN!? Like the[n]ones that made us, then up and[n]disappeared?

[msg MSG_008 [Akechi]]
That's most likely the scenario within[n]this movie... but I suppose you wouldn't[n]understand that.
In any case, we're different from your[n]human creators.

[msg MSG_009 [Yukiko]]
We're here looking for our friend...
Have you seen him anywhere? His face,[n]uh, looks exactly like yours.

[msg MSG_010 [Dinosaur with headphones]]
Exactly like mine? But, I'm not human―[n]I'm a dinosaur!

[msg MSG_011 [Kanji]]
Look, we don't really get it either, but[n]you two have the same face. So, have you[n]seen him?

[msg MSG_012 [Dinosaur with headphones]]
Nope, I sure haven't... I think.

[msg MSG_013 [Sulky herbivore]]
Hey, everyone―it's okay to come out now.

[msg MSG_014 [Loud herbivore]]
Really? Are they gone?

[msg MSG_015 [Nervous herbivore]]
I think so... At least, it seems safe...

[msg MSG_016 [Dinosaur with headphones]]
Oh, everyone's back―I'll try asking them[n]about your human friend.

[msg MSG_017 [Morgana]]
...Hey, aren't you at all upset with[n]them? They ditched you here without a[n]second thought!

[msg MSG_018 [Dinosaur with headphones]]
ねよろ るまぺゅゅを―と ゆまぺょデ もろ'れ やもょぽぺ ゆを みぺゎゅろ みよる[n]みぺゅゅもょむ ほまめもょぽテテテ とみ まわまるをよょま まゅれま ぼぺょ[n]れゎるわもわまデ ろめまるま'れ ょよろめもょむ まゅれま と ぼぺょ ぽよテ
But since they've come back, I'd feel[n]more comfortable sticking with them,[n]anyway.

[msg MSG_019 [Haru]]
Oh, I see...

[msg MSG_020 [Dinosaur with headphones]]
Thanks for worrying about me, though.[n]Well, I'll go ask them now!

[msg MSG_021 [Chie]]
A Yosuke-lookalike dinosaur, huh... I[n]guess he wasn't the real deal.

[msg MSG_022 [Yukiko]]
This is getting confusing... He doesn't[n]seem to be Yosuke-kun, so why don't we[n]name his species?

[msg MSG_023 [Chie]]
Name the species? Oh, you mean like some[n]Whatever-saurus kind of name?

[msg MSG_024 [Teddie]]
Ooh―let me, let me! I think "Junesaurus"[n]sounds quite majestic!

[msg MSG_025 [Yukiko]]
Whenever I think about Yosuke-kun, "the[n]Prince of Disappointment" comes to mind,[n]so... Disappointmentsaurus?

[sel SEL_026 top]
So, he's disappointing, huh...
Let's make it a bit briefer.
What about Partnersaurus?

[msg MSG_027 [Chie]]
Eheheh... Yosuke's a disappointment, but[n]it balances out because he's a prince,[n]too, see?

[msg MSG_028 [P4 Hero]]
He may be my partner, but that doesn't[n]apply to everyone.

[msg MSG_029 [Chie]]
Then, why don't we simplify it and just[n]call him "Yosukesaurus"?

[msg MSG_030 [Teddie]]
Ooh, Yosukesaurus! We get to name a[n]newly-discovered species!

[msg MSG_031 [Akechi]]
Actually, I don't believe he's part of a[n]new species―shouldn't he only be[n]considered a special case in this movie?

[msg MSG_032 [Haru]]
Oh, do you mean like what happened with[n]Kamoshidaman?

[msg MSG_033 [Kanji]]
Huh? What are you talkin' about?

[msg MSG_034 [Makoto]]
This phenomenon occurred in the previous[n]movie as well...
For some reason, a character in it had[n]been replaced with a person that looked[n]like someone we know.

[msg MSG_035 [Naoto]]
So, the dinosaur with Yosuke-senpai's[n]face didn't originally look like that...

[msg MSG_036 [Makoto]]
Most likely, it changed because you all[n]entered the film.

[msg MSG_037 [Yosukesaurus]]
Heeeey! I asked everyone else and I got[n]a firsthand account of someone who fit[n]your description!

[msg MSG_038 [Naoto]]
Is that so?

[msg MSG_039 [Yosukesaurus]]
But... He was super quick. They lost[n]sight of him right after they spotted[n]him.
According to one of them, he didn't seem[n]to be injured, or anything like that.

[msg MSG_040 [P4 Hero]]
I see―glad to hear it. Well, sounds like[n]he's safe.

[msg MSG_041 [Chie]]
Thanks for asking, Yosukesaurus!

[msg MSG_042 [Yosukesaurus]]
...Hm? Huh? Yosukesaurus?

[sel SEL_043 top]
That's you.
Do you not like it?

[msg MSG_044 [Yosukesaurus]]
Huh! You humans are interesting![n]Nobody's ever called me by a name[n]before.

[msg MSG_045 [Yosukesaurus]]
Nah, it feels pretty cool! Nobody's ever[n]called me by a name before.

[msg MSG_046 [Naoto]]
Well, we still need to find your[n]namesake...

[msg MSG_047 [Yosukesaurus]]
Then, why don't you come with us? We're[n]looking for "paradise."

[msg MSG_048 [P3 Fem Protag]]
What do you mean by that?

[msg MSG_049 [Yosukesaurus]]
Apparently, there's a place far from[n]here with no carnivores that's supposed[n]to be a paradise for us!
Looks like the human you're looking for[n]went in the same direction that we're[n]heading, too.

[msg MSG_050 [Akechi]]
A place of peace and repose, with no[n]carnivores... That was mentioned in the[n]movie's trailer.

[msg MSG_051 [Makoto]]
If we follow them, we may eventually be[n]able to change the movie's ending.

[msg MSG_052 [P4 Hero]]
All right―if that's the case, then we'll[n]go with you.

[msg MSG_053 [Yosukesaurus]]
Really? Well, glad to have you, partner!

[msg MSG_054 [Chie]]
Even though I know he's just a Yosuke[n]copy, he's so similar to the guy that[n]it's kinda freakin' me out!

[msg MSG_055 [Morgana]]
I guess you'll just have to get used to[n]it. Now, let's get outta here.
