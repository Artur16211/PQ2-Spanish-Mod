That looks like one helluva dangerous[n]gate...

[msg MSG_001 [Morgana]]
Yeah, my phantom thief intuition is[n]screaming "DANGER" right now.

[sel SEL_002 top]
No touching, got it?
Let's try touching it.
That's just your imagination.

[msg MSG_003 [Ryuji]]
...Are you tryin' to trick me into[n]touching it?

[msg MSG_004 [Naoto]]
Please, wait a moment. I believe it'd be[n]best not to touch it so carelessly.

[msg MSG_005 [Naoto]]
Please, wait a moment. Why don't we[n]first investigate it further?

[msg MSG_006 [Yosukesaurus]]
Oh! I know what that is!
It's a machine for trapping[n]carnivores.If you touch it, you get a[n]super-shock[f 0 1 0]!

[msg MSG_007 [Yusuke]]
Hm? Does that mean there's an electric[n]current running through it?

[msg MSG_008 [Ann]]
Wait a secâ€•if this is for big, scary[n]dinosaurs, then wouldn't it be extra bad[n]if a human touched it!?

[msg MSG_009 [Morgana]]
Hmm, looks like there's nothing we can[n]do with it, then...

[msg MSG_010 [Yosukesaurus]]
Heheh, no worries! I know a neat lil'[n]trick!

[msg MSG_011 [Haru]]
Do you know how to bypass this?

[msg MSG_012 [Yosukesaurus]]
You got it! The same kind of gates are[n]in other places here, too.
If I remember right, they have [f 0 1 2]metal[n]boxes near them, with handles[f 0 1 0]...
When you pull the handle down, the[n][f 0 1 2]shocking part stops for a bit[f 0 1 0].

[msg MSG_013 [Kanji]]
So, all we gotta do is pass through it[n]while it's still off?

[msg MSG_014 [Ryuji]]
Basically, we're looking for a switch to[n]the gate. Let's go find it!
