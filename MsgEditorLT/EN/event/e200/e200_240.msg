*gasp* *pant* We got away... from the[n]carnivore... right?

[msg MSG_001 [Morgana]]
Ah, we finally caught up to you.

[msg MSG_002 [Yosukesaurus]]
Oh, my bad―I totally forgot about you[n]guys...

[msg MSG_003 [Makoto]]
You really lost your composure back[n]there, and at the drop of a hat, too...[n]Wasn't that a little extreme?

[msg MSG_004 [Yosukesaurus]]
No way! Just take a look at that!

[msg MSG_005 [Yosukesaurus]]
There are a whole lot of carnivores[n]around here―that's why everyone's been[n]on edge.

[msg MSG_006 [Ann]]
Still, isn't it bad for your health to[n]just panic and flee like that all the[n]time?
Have you ever tried a different tactic?[n]You know, like fighting back, or[n]something.

[msg MSG_007 [Yosukesaurus]]
Don't be ridiculous! There's no way we[n]can win, even if we threw everyone at[n]them!
Anybody who's put up a fight has gotten[n]eaten. Who knows when it'll happen to us[n]too...

[msg MSG_008 [Chie]]
Hrgh... Now there's a grim thought...
I wonder how strong these carnivores[n]really are. Would it be impossible for[n]us, even with our Personas?

[sel SEL_009 top]
Should we give it a try?
Let's not tempt fate.
Oh, it'd be a breeze.

[msg MSG_010 [Naoto]]
I suspect that would be too dangerous...[n]As the saying goes, wounded bears are[n]the most dangerous...

[msg MSG_011 [Naoto]]
That would be the wisest course of[n]action. As the saying goes, wounded[n]bears are the most dangerous...

[msg MSG_012 [Yusuke]]
You seem quite confident. Should we go[n]find one now?

[msg MSG_013 [Naoto]]
I don't think we ought to tempt fate― as[n]the saying goes, wounded bears are the[n]most dangerous...

[msg MSG_014 [Chie]]
"Wounded bears"?

[msg MSG_015 [Naoto]]
When a wounded bear is cornered, its[n]desperation makes it especially scary.[n]The same is also said of boars.

[msg MSG_016 [Teddie]]
Then, does that mean I'd become[n]invincible if I got into a pinch?
Hraaaaaaaah! I'm pumped up now![n]Yosukeeeee! Just you wait for me!

[msg MSG_017 [Yosukesaurus]]
You idiot―shut up! We'll get spotted by[n]a carnivore!

[msg MSG_018 [Akechi]]
Remaining here any longer is also too[n]dangerous―we ought to pass through this[n]area quickly. Let's go.
