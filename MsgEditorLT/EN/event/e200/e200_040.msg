...A cage? What's somethin' like that[n]doin' in this old jungle?

[msg MSG_001 [Makoto]]
Remember the movie trailer? This seems[n]to be a theme park where one can observe[n]dinosaurs.

[msg MSG_002 [Yusuke]]
Then, it follows that these cages are[n]for keeping the dinosaurs under control.

[msg MSG_003 [Akechi]]
Would it be possible to move this? The[n]base looks like it's built to be[n]rotated. But, more importantly...
The story mentioned how humans have long[n]abandoned this place, and it looks like[n]it hasn't been used recently...

[msg MSG_005 [Futaba]]

[msg MSG_006 [Ryuji]]
Holy shit, for real!?

[msg MSG_007 [Futaba]]
Don't worry. I'll let you know if[n]there's any incoming danger.

[msg MSG_008 [Haru]]
Please do so, Oracle. We'll be counting[n]on you.

[msg MSG_009 [Futaba]]
Yeah! Just leave it to me!
