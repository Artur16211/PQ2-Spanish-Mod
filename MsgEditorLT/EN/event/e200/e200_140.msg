[msg MSG_000 [Makoto]]
I see... That's essentially the same[n]experience we had that led to our[n]arrival here.

[msg MSG_001 [Futaba]]
So, there are other places that are like[n]Mementos... Color me surprised.

[msg MSG_002 [Morgana]]
Well, spaces like that are born from[n]people's hearts―it wouldn't be all that[n]strange if there were others elsewhere.

[msg MSG_003 [Akechi]]
A space born from people's hearts, eh?
Is that why they're able to connect to[n]other, similar spaces?

[msg MSG_007 [Elizabeth]]
Most likely, such a deduction does not[n]solely apply to the realms within the[n]movies...
I believe the movie theater that we now[n]stand within is yet another world that[n]has been born for a specific reason.

[msg MSG_008 [Morgana]]
I see―that would explain why I've been[n]stuck in this form, too.

[msg MSG_009 [Person in bear costume]]
I don't get what you're saying, but[n]because of all this stuff going on,[n]Yosuke's...
Yosuke's all alone noooooow![n]Waaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

[msg MSG_010 [Akechi]]
Yosuke-kun? Is he the friend you[n]mentioned when we first met? The one who[n]got separated?
...All right, um, hold on. Please―Please[n]let me go... I-I can't breathe!

[msg MSG_011 [Reserved girl]]
I understand how you feel, but calm[n]down, Teddie.
Even if you bear-hug that extra glitzy[n]person, Yosuke-kun won't come out of[n]him.

[msg MSG_012 [Akechi]]
Eheheh... "Extra glitzy"...

[msg MSG_013 [Person in bear costume]]
*gasp* I smelled something nice from him[n]for a moment there, but she's right!
Plus, I'd rather go for this beautiful[n]lady...

[msg MSG_014 [Elizabeth]]
Here, this Megidolaon is for you.

[msg MSG_015 [Person in bear costume]]
Gyaaaaaaah!

[msg MSG_016 [P3 Fem Protag]]
...So, you've been separated from your[n]friend named Yosuke-kun, right?
He might still be in the movie. I got[n]separated from my own friends and ended[n]up in a movie. Maybe he did too.

[msg MSG_017 [Intelligent-looking boy]]
I see. I hope Yosuke-senpai makes it out[n]safely, like you did...

[msg MSG_018 [Energetic girl]]
Anyway―let's think positive! Nothing[n]good can come from panicking at a time[n]like this!
Rise-chan and Yosuke will both be fine![n]After all, they're in the Investigation[n]Team, too!

[msg MSG_019 [Composed boy]]
Right―Yosuke would never go down so[n]easily.
Still, he must feel lonely being[n]separated from us. We need to hurry and[n]rescue him.

[msg MSG_020 [Person in bear costume]]
S-Sensei...
Teddie is back and better than ever![n]Rescuing Yosuke'll be the only thing on[n]my mind!

[msg MSG_021 [Composed boy]]
I'm sorry, we're a bit rowdy.
I know it's a bit late for it, but we[n]haven't introduced ourselves. I'd love[n]to learn more about you all as well.

[msg MSG_022 [Ryuji]]
Oh yeah, that's right. Welp, time for[n]introductions...

[msg MSG_023 [Energetic girl]]
Huh? So, what should we do? Who goes[n]first?

[msg MSG_024 [Person in bear costume]]
Obviously, it should be Sensei! Who[n]could be better?

[msg MSG_025 [Reserved girl]]
True, he is our leader.

[msg MSG_026 [Composed boy]]
Got it. My name is...
