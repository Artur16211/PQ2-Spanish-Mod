A-Ah... Whaaaa...

[msg MSG_001 [Haru]]
Oh no! That carnivore just snatched her!

[msg MSG_002 [Sulky herbivore]]
......

[msg MSG_003 [Nervous herbivore]]
......

[msg MSG_004 [Makoto]]
Why're you just standing there? If we[n]don't hurry after them, there'll be[n]nothing we can do to help!

[msg MSG_005 [Stubborn herbivore]]
......
So... Isn't this when we do the thing?

[msg MSG_006 [Yosukesaurus]]
Huh?
Oh... Right...

[msg MSG_007 [Yukiko]]
What's the "thing"?

[msg MSG_008 [Yosukesaurus]]
...We vote on what to do.

[msg MSG_009 [Ryuji]]
What? Voting!?

[msg MSG_010 [Stubborn herbivore]]
Alright, first thing...
If you think we should go after the[n]carnivore, raise your hand!

[msg MSG_011 [Sulky herbivore]]
Won't it be dangerous, though?

[msg MSG_012 [Nervous herbivore]]
We could get ourselves eaten too...

[msg MSG_013 [P4 Hero]]
...Does no one intend to rescue their[n]companion?

[msg MSG_014 [Yosukesaurus]]
Nngh... I...

[sel SEL_015 top]
You want to save her, right?
Be honest with how you feel.

[msg MSG_016 [Yosukesaurus]]
Y-Yeah...

[msg MSG_017 [Pouting herbivore dino]]
One vote for going after her.

[msg MSG_018 [Stubborn herbivore]]
Now, those who think we should leave[n]well enough alone, raise your hand!

[msg MSG_019]
The remaining herbivores all raised[n]their hands...

[msg MSG_020 [Chie]]
Wha―Seriously!?

[msg MSG_021 [Stubborn herbivore]]
The majority vote is to move on without[n]our companion. Does anyone dissent?

[msg MSG_022 [Yosukesaurus]]
N-No...

[msg MSG_023 [Kanji]]
You asshole! Are you seriously fine with[n]this!?

[msg MSG_024 [Yosukesaurus]]
Well, we're weak, so we won't survive if[n]we don't act together...

[msg MSG_025 [Ann]]
But didn't you want to save your[n]companion?

[msg MSG_026 [Yosukesaurus]]
Y-Yeah, but... it's already been decided[n]by majority vote...

[msg MSG_027 [Makoto]]
I admit, such a decision may sometimes[n]be necessary for one's survival in[n]nature. Even still...

[msg MSG_028 [Yosukesaurus]]
...There's nothing I can do about it. I[n]do feel sorry for her, though.

[msg MSG_029 [Teddie]]
Grrrrr! You may have the same face as[n]Yosuke, but you're not like him at all[n]on the inside!
The real Yosuke would―He'd...
He'd care about his companions more than[n]you!

[msg MSG_030 [P4 Hero]]
You're right. Yosukesaurus isn't[n]actually Yosuke...
But I still can't agree with his way of[n]thinking.

[msg MSG_031 [Morgana]]
Hey, Joker―are you fine with abandoning[n]that herbivore like this?

[sel SEL_032 top]
Let's go save her.
We can do it ourselves.

[msg MSG_033 [Yusuke]]
Yes, she needs to be rescued.

[msg MSG_034 [Yosukesaurus]]
You say that now, but... They're already[n]long gone.

[msg MSG_035 [Haru]]
Oracle! Rise-chan!

[msg MSG_036 [Futaba]]
Yep! We heard all of y'all!

[msg MSG_037 [Rise]]
Yeah, leave it to us―we'll find 'em in a[n]flash!

[msg MSG_038 [Yosukesaurus]]
Wh-What're you guys―

[msg MSG_039 [Futaba]]
Got 'em! They seem to be one floor down.

[msg MSG_040 [Rise]]
Mmhm, they're definitely downstairs...[n]But, I don't think we can pinpoint[n]exactly where they are.

[msg MSG_041 [Kanji]]
Heh, knowin' which way to go is more[n]than enough. Let's get to it!

[msg MSG_042 [P4 Hero]]
Right. We'll definitely save her.
