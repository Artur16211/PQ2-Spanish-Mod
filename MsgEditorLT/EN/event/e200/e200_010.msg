On a remote island in the distant sea...

[msg MSG_000_1]
There exists a theme park of living[n]dinosaurs, revived through genetic[n]manipulation.

[msg MSG_001]
Oh? This one has dinosaurs.

[msg MSG_002]
I'm getting a bad feeling about this...

[msg MSG_003]
When the humans left, the island became[n]a natural habitat for the once-lost[n]creatures.

[msg MSG_003_1]
It was a land ruled by the carnivores,[n]where the law of the jungle prevailed!

[msg MSG_004]
Meanwhile, the herbivores struggled to[n]survive in this harsh world.

[msg MSG_005]
Desperate and powerless, they formed[n]herds as they struggled to escape the[n]carnivores...

[msg MSG_006]
At this time, an evil rises from within[n]the ranks: one that can't take a hint[n]and fall in line!

[msg MSG_007]
No one agrees with her, yet she[n]continues to oppose the herd with their[n]opinions!

[msg MSG_008]
Numbers don't lie! The majority rules!

[msg MSG_008_1]
A useless opinion voiced by a lone[n]dissenter is nothing but a nuisance!

[msg MSG_009]
Will the righteous majority ever be able[n]to silence the evil minority...

[msg MSG_009_1]
...and finally find peace and[n]tranquility within the "paradise" of[n]ancient legend!?

[msg MSG_010]
The greatest, most massive dinosaur[n]movie ever brought to screen:

[msg MSG_010_1]
Junessic Land!

[msg MSG_011]
Now showing!
