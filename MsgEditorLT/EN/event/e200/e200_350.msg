[msg MSG_000]
We've brought the frozen meat and[n]cooking equipment along with us while[n]hunting for a good cooking spot...

[msg MSG_001 [Yusuke]]
Hmm, if we're going to cook this meat,[n]why not do it around here?

[msg MSG_002 [Naoto]]
It's an open area, there's a water[n]source nearby... I'd say it's as safe a[n]place to cook as we could hope for.
We may have only found a pot to cook in,[n]but we should be fine, so long as we[n]have a heat source for it...
The only thing is that we have no recipe[n]to work from. Will that be a problem?

[msg MSG_003 [Yukiko]]
Naoto-kun, new discoveries are always[n]waiting to be made in cooking. We just[n]need to believe in ourselves!

[msg MSG_004 [Rise]]
Mmhm! Improvising a tasty dish with a[n]minimal number of ingredients is a[n]useful cooking skill, too.

[msg MSG_005 [Chie]]
I'm getting fired up! Time for us gals[n]to bust out our culinary skills!
Let's get to it!

[msg MSG_006 [P4 Hero]]
W-Wait... Since there's only so much[n]meat, shouldn't we get a more reliable―[n]I mean, less experimental cook?

[msg MSG_007 [Yosuke]]
Y-Yeah, what he said! We'll handle the[n]cooking part of the bait, and you can,[n]uh...
I know! You can go out and look for[n]other ingredients for us to use![n]Please!?

[msg MSG_008 [Kanji]]
You're kinda freakin' out there,[n]Yosuke-senpai―I get it, though...

[msg MSG_009 [Chie]]
Hey, what's that supposed to mean!? Does[n]our cooking really upset you so much?

[sel SEL_010 top]
It's more freaky than upsetting.
I'll be counting on you ladies.
You'd be the best at gathering.

[msg MSG_011 [Yosuke]]
Yeah, it's super fre―Wait, did you[n]really just say that out loud!?

[msg MSG_012 [Yosuke]]
Wha!? Uh, you mean, like, you're[n]counting on them to gather a lot of[n]ingredients, yeah?

[msg MSG_013 [Yosuke]]
Yeah, what he said! We want you to use[n]your... feminine instincts, or whatever,[n]to find the best ingredients for us!

[msg MSG_014 [P4 Hero]]

[msg MSG_015 [Haru]]
Looking for ingredients does sound[n]fun... I feel like we can find lots of[n]new and interesting ones here.

[msg MSG_016 [Ann]]
Ooh, I wanna do that too! What say we[n]leave the cooking to them and us gals go[n]on a little hunt?

[msg MSG_017 [Naoto]]
*chuckle* You make it sound like an[n]adventure... That seems more to my taste[n]as well.

[msg MSG_018 [Akechi]]
In that case, how about we prepare the[n]food while you ladies search for[n]additional ingredients?

[msg MSG_019 [Yukiko]]
Sounds all right to me. We'll leave the[n]cooking up to you―this time.

[msg MSG_020 [Chie]]
Okay, off we go―in search of new meats!

[msg MSG_021 [Yukiko]]
Um, we already have the meat, so why[n]don't we look for... other ingredients,[n]for flavor―like seaweed and shark fin?

[msg MSG_022 [Makoto]]
Don't tell me we're walking all the way[n]to the ocean to forage... At any rate,[n]we should get going.

[msg MSG_023 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Yeah! Let's go, ladies!

[msg MSG_024 [Teddie]]
Whew, it worked... Excellent job,[n]Yosuke!

[msg MSG_025 [Yosuke]]
If we'd have left the cooking to them,[n]we wouldn't end up with bait―we'd get a[n]chemical weapon...

[msg MSG_026 [Ryuji]]
Dude... Are the girls on your team[n]really that bad at cooking?

[msg MSG_027 [Yosuke]]
Don't even ask... There are things in[n]this world you're better off not[n]knowing.

[msg MSG_028 [Teddie]]
But have no fear! Our Sensei is a master[n]cook!

[msg MSG_029 [Morgana]]
Oh? I'd bet Joker's skills stack up[n]with's...
After all, he's lodging at a caf〒. When[n]it comes to cooking curry, he can't be[n]beat!

[msg MSG_030 [P4 Hero]]
That's great to hear. Let's work[n]together so we can make sure this turns[n]out well.

[sel SEL_031 top]
I'm expecting top-tier cuisine.
This is such a drag.
I'll steal your appetites!

[msg MSG_032 [Yosuke]]
Oh, are you guys bonding over cooking?

[msg MSG_033 [Ryuji]]
Hell yeah, looks like this is gonna be a[n]real show! I can't wait to see what they[n]whip up.

[msg MSG_034 [Yusuke]]
Cooking in an unfamiliar setting can be[n]discomforting. The inconvenience alone[n]may seem impossible to handle...
However, anything can be eaten once it's[n]been cooked―that is the one thing I am[n]most certain of.

[msg MSG_035 [Kanji]]
I don't know why, but, the way this guy[n]talks... I believe him.

[msg MSG_036 [Teddie]]
Ohhh, his pride as a chef has been[n]ignited like a bonfire!

[msg MSG_037 [Yusuke]]
It seems that we can expect something[n]great from them. I can't wait to taste[n]what they make.

[msg MSG_038 [Ryuji]]
While you're droolin' over there, may I[n]remind you that we're doing all this to[n]make dino bait, not Fox food?

[msg MSG_039]
After cleaning the meat and finishing[n]the other cooking preparations...

[msg MSG_040 [Akechi]]
It seems that we're ready to cook once[n]the ladies return.
Joker and [f 6 1 12 0 0 0]-kun both handled[n]everything so skillfully. I'm impressed.

[msg MSG_041 [Morgana]]
It's already lookin' tasty and it's not[n]even cooked yet... I'm excited to see[n]how this turns out.

[msg MSG_042 [Futaba]]
Hey, dudes―looks like the Gatherin'[n]Girls are back.

[msg MSG_043 [Chie]]
Sorry about the wait!

[msg MSG_044 [Yukiko]]
We collected a lot of ingredients.

[msg MSG_045 [Ryuji]]
Ooh, perfect timin'. So, what did you[n]bring back?

[msg MSG_046 [Naoto]]
This is what I found.

[msg MSG_047 [Yosuke]]
...Um, is it some kind of grass?

[msg MSG_048 [Haru]]
It appears to be some type of herb.
Here, give it a sniff―doesn't it smell[n]nice?

[msg MSG_049 [Morgana]]
Meowww!? That's a bit too grassy for my[n]nose...

[msg MSG_050 [Akechi]]
It is rather... pungent, but herbs can[n]complement the smell of meats well, so[n]these could be quite useful.

[msg MSG_051 [Chie]]
Okay, me next! Take a look...[n]Ta-daaaaah!

[msg MSG_052 [Kanji]]
Holy shit, it's huge! What kinda egg is[n]this!?

[msg MSG_053 [Chie]]
Eh, I dunno. I just saw it on the ground[n]and picked it up.

[msg MSG_054 [Yosuke]]
Dude, this thing better not end up[n]hatching on us...

[msg MSG_055 [Yusuke]]
とろ めぺれ ぺ らゅまぺれぺょろ れめぺらまデ ほゎろ ぺ ほよゅぽデ ゐもゅぽ[n]らぺろろまるょ―と ゐぺょろ ろよ ろぺやま もろ ほぺぼや みよる みゎるろめまる[n]れろゎぽを もょれろまぺぽ よみ ぼるぺぼやもょむ もろ よらまょテテテ

[msg MSG_056 [Yukiko]]
This is what I found―here you go.

[msg MSG_057 [P4 Hero]]
Is that... some kind of bug-eating[n]pitcher plant?

[msg MSG_058 [Teddie]]
My animal instincts... are telling me[n]that thing's dangerous...

[msg MSG_059 [Yukiko]]
Wouldn't it be cute as a serving dish? I[n]just picked it, so it's nice and fresh.

[sel SEL_060 top]
That's a great idea.
That thing is so creepy.
We should cook it instead.

[msg MSG_061 [Ryuji]]
Dude, are you for real!? If we use that[n]as a dish, it'll just eat the food[n]itself!

[msg MSG_062 [Yusuke]]
I suppose it doesn't appeal to[n]everyone's sense of beauty. However, I[n]find it rather magnificent.

[msg MSG_063 [Yukiko]]
Right? I think it looks really neat too!

[msg MSG_064 [P4 Hero]]
There's nothing more I can say...

[msg MSG_065 [Yukiko]]
It's really fleshy and fibrous, so I bet[n]it has great texture. It seems like it[n]would be pretty healthy, too.

[msg MSG_066 [Ryuji]]
Isn't Amagi-san next in line to be the[n]hostess of some historic inn?

[msg MSG_066_5 [Ryuji]]
Did I hear that wrong? Please tell me I[n]did...

[msg MSG_067 [P4 Hero]]
No, you didn't... But, I know what you[n]mean...

[msg MSG_068 [Ann]]
Aw, man... Everybody else gets to show[n]off a bunch of cool stuff, but all I got[n]were these...

[msg MSG_069 [Ryuji]]
What is it, what is it? C'mon, show us!

[msg MSG_070 [Morgana]]
Ooooh, what an enticing aroma! Could[n]those be what I think they are?

[msg MSG_071 [Haru]]
They're wild matsutake mushrooms!
-chan spotted them, then the ladies of[n]the Phantom Thieves swiped every last[n]one!

[msg MSG_072 [Yosuke]]
Daaaaamn! Those things are expensive―[n]and there's so many!

[msg MSG_073 [Akechi]]
But, why are matsutake mushrooms growing[n]in a jungle?

[msg MSG_074 [Naoto]]
I suspect they were most likely involved[n]in genetic manipulation experiments.
The researchers may have developed them[n]concurrently with the dinosaurs...[n]That's just my own speculation, though.

[msg MSG_075 [P3 Fem Protag]]
So, the girls' total yield is a bunch of[n]herbs, some kind of egg, a pitcher[n]plant, and lots of matsutake mushrooms!

[msg MSG_076 [Makoto]]
That pitcher plant is a bit... you know,[n]but the others seem quite usable, right?

[msg MSG_077 [Yusuke]]
The pot has been brought up to proper[n]temperature, and the meat is ready to go[n]as well.
Joker, [f 6 1 12 0 0 0]―we leave the rest in your[n]capable hands.

[msg MSG_078 [P4 Hero]]
I guess we'll cook the mushrooms first.[n]What should we do with them?

[sel SEL_079 top]
Quickly roast them over the fire.
Mince them up extremely fine.

[msg MSG_080 [Morgana]]
Oooh―the moment they hit the flames,[n]this pleasant scent wafted my way...

[msg MSG_081 [Teddie]]
My appetite's been fully roused. I can[n]feel my tummy growling like mad!

[msg MSG_082 [Makoto]]
Huh? That's a... surprising method...

[msg MSG_083 [Chie]]
Whoa, they just keep getting smaller and[n]smaller, at such insane speed... It[n]almost feels like a waste!

[msg MSG_084 [P4 Hero]]
All right, next up is the meat. How do[n]you think we should cook it?

[sel SEL_085 top]
Quickly sear it over high heat.
Simmer it slowly over low heat.

[msg MSG_086 [Ryuji]]
Oh man, it looks sooooo good! It's got[n]those burn marks an' everything! I'm[n]gettin' hungry...

[msg MSG_087 [Yukiko]]
Hungry? Try some of this, then!

[msg MSG_088 [Ryuji]]
Ooh, don't mind if I d―
Augh, this is that bug-eatin' plant![n]It's still moving; there's no way I'm[n]gonna eat this―Wait, why is it MOVING!?

[msg MSG_089 [Chie]]
Grilling it so slowly is making me[n]antsy...

[msg MSG_090 [Yukiko]]
I agree with you there. I'd rather[n]scorch it with a strong flame.

[msg MSG_091 [Yosuke]]
I'm begging you, Yukiko―please, don't go[n]anywhere near that fire...

[msg MSG_092 [Yusuke]]
...Ah, this meat is beautifully browned.[n]I believe it's ready to plate.

[msg MSG_093 [Makoto]]
Now, we should garnish it with the[n]mushrooms we prepared...

[msg MSG_094 [Chie]]
And now we add the special sauce...[n]There―voila!

[msg MSG_095 [Yosuke]]
Wha―Chie! What the hell did you just[n]do!?

[msg MSG_096 [Chie]]
It's, uhh... Movie Meat with Foraged[n]Jungle Sauce?

[msg MSG_097 [Yosuke]]
I meant what's IN the sauce! And when[n]did you even make that stuff!?

[msg MSG_098 [Yukiko]]
We combined the egg white, the herbs,[n]and some liquid from the inside of the[n]pitcher plant, then boiled it all down.

[msg MSG_099 [Naoto]]
Um... They said not using the[n]ingredients they brought back would be a[n]waste, so...

[msg MSG_099_5 [Naoto]]
I couldn't stop them. I'm sorry.

[msg MSG_100 [Yusuke]]
Good god, this dish appears to have[n]been... slimed!

[msg MSG_101 [Chie]]
とろ'れデ ゎゆテテテ ぶめぺろ ぽよ ろめまを ぼぺゅゅ もろ? のるむぺょもぼ?[n]だゅれよデ もろ'れ ょもぼま ぺょぽ むるままょデ ぺょぽ ぽよまれょ'ろ もろ[n]れゆまゅゅ ゅもやま れよゆまろめもょむ ぺ ぽもょよ ゐよゎゅぽ まぺろ?

[msg MSG_102 [Yosuke]]
Not in the least! It just reeks. It[n]smells like... grassy eggs!

[msg MSG_103 [Kanji]]
What're we gonna do with this? It's been[n]turned into some kinda mystery object.

[msg MSG_104 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Should we... do a taste test?

[msg MSG_105 [Yosuke]]
Huh!? But who's gonna―

[msg MSG_106 [Teddie]]
Alley-oop! Down your hatch.

[msg MSG_107 [Yosuke]]
Hrgh!? Bluh! Ah, you moron! I-I don't[n]wanna die yet―Blech! Blech!

[msg MSG_108 [P4 Hero]]
Yosuke... Please make it through this[n]alive...

[msg MSG_109 [Yosuke]]
*cough* Urgh! *wheeze*

[msg MSG_110 [Ann]]
Are you okay!? Should we try to make you[n]throw up or something?

[msg MSG_111 [Yosuke]]
N-Nnnnngh... Hrrrrrghhhh!
I-It's... It's...

[msg MSG_112 [Yosuke]]
It's... delicious!!!

[msg MSG_113 [Morgana]]
Are you for real!?

[msg MSG_114 [Yosuke]]
Seriously! It's so good, it makes no[n]sense! Try it, you guys!

[msg MSG_115 [P3 Fem Protag]]
*munch munch*
Wow, he's right, this is good! It's[n]creamy and bursting with flavor!

[msg MSG_116 [Haru]]
Mm, this could be quite addicting... The[n]sauce adds a richness to the meat that[n]really complements the flavor.

[msg MSG_117 [Ryuji]]
I can't believe it―that slime worked!?[n]Did it have some kinda chemical reaction[n]with the meat or something?

[msg MSG_118 [Yusuke]]
What a unique harmony of flavor and[n]aroma! This sauce is nothing less than a[n]miraculous collaboration.

[msg MSG_119 [Chie]]
Hear that, Yosuke? Our cooking skills[n]can't be beat!

[msg MSG_120 [Yosuke]]
No, this was a miracle combined with a[n]coincidence... If not for the meat, this[n]would just be eggy, grassy slime.

[msg MSG_121 [Akechi]]
In any case, I think we should be able[n]to lure the carnivore with this.

[msg MSG_122 [Naoto]]
Let's go set the bait before it gets[n]cold.
