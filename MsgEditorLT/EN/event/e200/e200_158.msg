Those two seem so dependable. I was[n]rather surprised at first with their...[n]divergent personalities.

[msg MSG_001 [Makoto]]
Yes, I appreciate their support. It[n]should really improve our odds in[n]combat.

[msg MSG_002 [Kanji]]
Alright, that means the exploration's[n]only gonna go better from here!

[msg MSG_003 [Chie]]
Mmhm! It'll make searching for Yosuke[n]easier too, so why don't we pop back in[n]there?

[msg MSG_004 [P4 Hero]]
Hang on... I have a suggestion first.

[msg MSG_005 [Morgana]]
Hm? What is it?

[msg MSG_006 [P4 Hero]]
It seems like you all know more about[n]this world than we do...
Would it be all right if we asked your[n]leader, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0], to command us as well?

[msg MSG_007 [Naoto]]
Confusion about the chain of command is[n]a common cause of defeat. I think such a[n]decision would be very wise.

[msg MSG_008 [P4 Hero]]
How about it? Won't you accept the[n]leader role?

[sel SEL_009 top]
All right.
Leave it to me.
I don't know...

[msg MSG_010 [P4 Hero]]
Thanks for your help. We'll do our best[n]out there.

[msg MSG_011 [Chie]]
Ohhh! He's just as dependable as our[n]leader!

[msg MSG_012 [Ryuji]]
What's there to think about? I know[n]you'd crush it as our overall leader.

[msg MSG_013 [Makoto]]
I think you're best suited as well.[n]There's no need for concern.

[msg MSG_014 [Naoto]]
That settles the matter.
From here on, we leave the commands to[n]you, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]-san.

[msg MSG_015 [Teddie]]
Now that we've wrapped that up, let us[n]venture forth into the movie! Here we[n]gooooo!
