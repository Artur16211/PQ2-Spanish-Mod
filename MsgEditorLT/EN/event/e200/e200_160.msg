[msg MSG_000 [Makoto]]
Whew... It seems there's still a ways[n]for us to go. Is everyone's health okay?

[msg MSG_001 [Yukiko]]
Mmhm, this is nothing so far.
But wow―your clothes really do change![n]It's so amazing, is there some kind of[n]trick behind it?

[msg MSG_002 [Makoto]]
I know it's amazing and all, but it's a[n]bit embarrassing to be stared at like[n]that...

[msg MSG_003 [Naoto]]
I agree that your attire is intriguing,[n]but your nicknames―Joker and the like...
Could they be codenames?

[msg MSG_004 [Akechi]]
*chuckle* Has the detective found a[n]working theory?

[msg MSG_005 [Naoto]]
W-Well, no... It's simply my own[n]curiosity.

[msg MSG_006 [Yusuke]]
Considering how we rile up society to[n]such a degree, we're all but required to[n]perform our work incognito.
That's the reason we decided to use[n]codenames for each other during our[n]missions.

[msg MSG_007 [Teddie]]
Oooooh! That sounds so cool!

[msg MSG_008 [Yukiko]]
Hey―I want a codename too.

[msg MSG_009 [Chie]]
Wha―Yukiko!?

[msg MSG_010 [Yukiko]]
I mean, it's so cool. Don't you want one[n]too, Naoto-kun?

[msg MSG_011 [Naoto]]
Huh!? I-I... Um... I was only thinking[n]how useful they could be if we had them[n]too...

[msg MSG_012 [Yukiko]]
Chie, we'd better hurry and decide our[n]codenames. What are they going to be?

[msg MSG_013 [Chie]]
How'd I get roped into this!?
I mean, coming up with a codename so[n]suddenly... We're not experts on that!

[msg MSG_014 [Morgana]]
I guess there's no way around it then―[n]leave it to us pros!
Joker, come up with a cool phantom thief[n]name for Yukiko.

[sel SEL_015 top]
Scarlet Princess.
Black Fire.
Hostess.

[msg MSG_017 [Ann]]
Then, how about Princess Scarlet? Isn't[n]that cuter?

[msg MSG_018 [Ryuji]]
All you did was flip the words! That's[n]still way too much crammed into one[n]codename.

[msg MSG_019 [Yukiko]]
Ooh, I like it. It sounds strong.

[msg MSG_020 [Ryuji]]
You like it!?

[msg MSG_021 [Yusuke]]
But why black? She's wearing red.

[msg MSG_022 [Teddie]]
Could it be... Has he seen right through[n]Yuki-chan to her true nature?

[msg MSG_023 [Yukiko]]
Did you say something, Teddie? *giggle*[n]Do you want to be burnt?

[msg MSG_024 [Yusuke]]
I... see. Black Fire... It embodies her[n]true nature after all.

[msg MSG_025 [Ryuji]]
Are you even trying!? That's so boring![n]At least spruce it up some!

[msg MSG_025_5 [Ryuji]]
Hey, how about Okami? The Japanese word[n]for a hotel boss lady sounds way more[n]intimidating than "Hostess," right?

[msg MSG_026 [Ann]]

[msg MSG_027 [Chie]]
It feels like they're just gonna start[n]spouting Japanese words like teriyaki[n]and tempura for our codenames...

[msg MSG_028 [Yukiko]]
Okay, you're next, Naoto-kun.

[msg MSG_029 [Naoto]]
Huh? We're really going to do this for[n]everyone...?

[msg MSG_030 [Yusuke]]
Let's see... How about Platinum Lady?

[msg MSG_031 [Ryuji]]
What? Why "Lady," though...

[msg MSG_032 [Ann]]
True, I think "Lady" is a bit prudish.[n]Wouldn't Platinum Girl be better?

[msg MSG_033 [Ryuji]]
Wait, no! I mean, why are you guys using[n]"Lady" and "Girl" for Naoto!?

[msg MSG_034 [Haru]]
Why not? Naoto-kun's a girl.

[msg MSG_035 [Ryuji]]
Wha―Huhhh? For real!? Did you know,[n]Joker!?

[sel SEL_036 top]
Of course I knew.
I had no idea...

[msg MSG_037 [Ryuji]]
Seriously? When did you figure that[n]out!?

[msg MSG_038 [Ryuji]]
Right!? There's no way I should've[n]known, yeah!?

[msg MSG_039 [Ann]]
Maybe it's because you're so dense. I[n]thought everyone knew.

[msg MSG_040 [Ryuji]]
This has nothing to do with me being[n]dense! I just... didn't have a clue. I[n]mean―I can't believe it...

[msg MSG_041 [Naoto]]
L-Let's stop talking about this, shall[n]we!? Rise-san, you're next!

[msg MSG_042 [Rise]]
Me? Ooh, what kind of name do you think[n]would be good for me?

[msg MSG_043 [Ryuji]]
For Risette, huh... Idol? But that seems[n]so obvious.

[msg MSG_044 [Teddie]]
Plus that could confuse others into[n]thinking of myself―I'm an idol too.

[msg MSG_045 [Chie]]
Yeah, yeah―moving on...

[msg MSG_046 [Rise]]
I guess Kung Fu for you, Chie-senpai?[n]Or, maybe, something meat related...

[msg MSG_047 [Haru]]
Meat... Hmm... Sirloin?

[msg MSG_048 [Yukiko]]
Oh, that's totally Chie! And it's easier[n]to say than Filet Mignon, too.

[msg MSG_049 [Chie]]
What's with these codenames!? They're[n]just cuts of meat! Aw, man...

[msg MSG_050 [Ann]]
Welp, next is Kanji-kun... Since you're[n]wearing a skeleton shirt, maybe Skull,[n]Part 2?

[msg MSG_051 [Kanji]]
Wha―!? Why're you treatin' me like some[n]kinda sequel!?

[msg MSG_052 [Yukiko]]
Hm... Well, he's always yelling[n]"dammit," so... Dammit Skull?
Snrk...! That sounds so ridiculous...[n]*snort* Heeheehee... Ahahahahahaha!

[msg MSG_053 [Kanji]]
I don't even care anymore... I mean, how[n]much longer are we gonna do this?

[msg MSG_054 [Teddie]]
Oh, mine hasn't been decided yet! Maybe[n]something like Pretty Boy, or Cutie[n]Bear...

[msg MSG_055 [Ryuji]]
Yours is just Ted. Done.

[msg MSG_056 [Teddie]]
Grrrrr! We're nowhere near done!
There are so many for me to choose from,[n]like Everyone's Idol, or Beloved Lad...[n]I just can't pick one!

[msg MSG_057 [Yusuke]]
Even still, it's Ted.

[msg MSG_058 [Makoto]]
Mmhm. Ted.

[msg MSG_059 [Teddie]]
H-How cruel... At this rate, all I can[n]do is hope for Sensei to avenge me!

[msg MSG_060 [Ann]]
A codename for [f 6 1 13 0 0 0], huh... What do[n]you think would be good, Joker?

[sel SEL_061 top]
Kingpin.
Sensei.
Yasogami Wolf.

[msg MSG_062 [P4 Hero]]
Kingpin...

[msg MSG_063 [Yusuke]]
That's surprisingly fitting, for some[n]reason.

[msg MSG_064 [Ryuji]]
It's gotta be because of that one-on-one[n]bout with Joker when we first met.

[msg MSG_065 [Teddie]]
Now that's our Sensei! A codename with[n]some real dignity!

[msg MSG_066 [P4 Hero]]
Sensei, huh? It feels a bit weird to be[n]called that by someone other than[n]Teddie...

[msg MSG_067 [Teddie]]
I get to call him Sensei because we have[n]a special relationship with each other![n]That codename's for Teddie use only!

[msg MSG_068 [P4 Hero]]
Yasogami Wolf!?

[msg MSG_069 [Yusuke]]
Aha... That's rather impressive. It has[n]a strong and dignified ring to it.

[msg MSG_070 [Ryuji]]
Oh, c'mon... Isn't that a bit too[n]extreme?

[msg MSG_071 [P4 Hero]]
Yasogami Wolf... Interesting...

[msg MSG_072 [Naoto]]
Oh! Surprising as it may be, he seems to[n]like it.

[msg MSG_073 [Yukiko]]
If this is for [f 6 1 13 0 0 0]-kun, it may be a[n]good idea to mention Nanako-chan[n]somehow.

[msg MSG_074 [Kanji]]
Like... Nanako's Bro?

[msg MSG_075 [P4 Hero]]
Not bad.

[msg MSG_076 [Haru]]
Um... Who's Nanako-chan? Is she[n]family,-kun?

[msg MSG_077 [P4 Hero]]
Yeah, she's my cousin in elementary[n]school. I live with her and her father.

[msg MSG_078 [Ryuji]]
Ah, so it's kinda like Joker and Oracle.

[msg MSG_079 [Futaba]]
Hey! I'm bigger than a schoolgirl,[n]Skull!

[msg MSG_080 [Ryuji]]
THAT'S what pissed you off!?

[msg MSG_081 [Morgana]]
*sigh* I have no idea what's even[n]happening anymore...

[msg MSG_082 [Naoto]]
Why don't we stop giving codenames to[n]each other? I don't think we're doing[n]ourselves any good at this rate...

[sel SEL_083 top]
That's true.
What a bummer.

[msg MSG_084 [Yukiko]]
Ah, that was fun. Let's think up more[n]codenames later.

[msg MSG_085 [Chie]]
Fine... all we ended up doing here was[n]run our mouths, anyway.

[msg MSG_086 [Morgana]]
Well, since you guys don't need secret[n]identities, I don't think you need any[n]codenames, either.
Let's just focus on getting out of here.
