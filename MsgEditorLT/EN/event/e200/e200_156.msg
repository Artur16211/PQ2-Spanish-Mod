*sigh* Well, listen up. I'm gonna[n]explain this once...
I'll help you connect with "worlds that[n]aren't here." There are people just like[n]you in those.
And when I say just like you, they're[n]trapped in their worlds as well.
It's called "StreetPass." I'm pretty[n]sure they'll help you out in some way.

You can now perform "StreetPass."

[msg MSG_003 [Ryuji]]
Oh, I gotcha. We'll leave all that to[n]you, then.

[msg MSG_004 [Margaret]]
*chuckle* You've grown quite accustomed[n]to providing such explanations...
All that's left for you now is to[n]improve your poetryâ€•

[msg MSG_005 [Marie]]
LALALAAAA! What was that!? What!? I have[n]nooo idea what you're talking about!

[msg MSG_005_5 [Marie]]
M-More importantly, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]! Do you have[n]any more questions!?

[sel SEL_006 top]
I'm good.
What's this about poetry?

[msg MSG_007 [Marie]]
Huh, you catch on surprisingly quick...[n]unlike someone else.

[msg MSG_008 [Margaret]]
Oh dear, whomever could you mean?[n]*chuckle*

[msg MSG_010 [Chie]]
It's grown pretty obvious by now, but[n]Margaret's quite the sadist, isn't she?

[msg MSG_011 [Marie]]
What are you, a moron!? I said I have no[n]idea!
There's no poetry to be found, got it!?[n]You better not go snooping around for[n]it!

[msg MSG_012 [Ann]]
Wow, she's like an open book! She's the[n]easiest to read!

[msg MSG_013 [Morgana]]
I wonder whether it's human nature or my[n]phantom thief side that makes me wanna[n]check those out even more now...
