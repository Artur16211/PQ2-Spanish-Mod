[msg MSG_000 [Haru]]
Whoa, he's parrying all of Joker's[n]attacks...

[msg MSG_001 [Makoto]]
Now's not the time to be impressed.[n]According to Oracle, there are more[n]humans with strong powers here...

[msg MSG_002 [Energetic girl]]
Whoa, whoa, what's happening!? They're[n]totally duking it out...

[msg MSG_003 [Menacing-looking boy]]
Holy shit―that masked guy's an equal[n]match for Senpai!?

[msg MSG_004 [Reserved girl]]
Huh? A masked―
You're right! Those people are all[n]dressed up! Are they trying to win some[n]sort of costume contest?

[msg MSG_005 [Person in bear costume]]
HELLOOOO! Rise-chan's in serious[n]trouble!
I know we're all worried about Yosuke[n]too, but there's no time for chatting[n]like this!

[msg MSG_006 [Intelligent-looking boy]]
But, the current situation―how do we get[n]this under control?

[msg MSG_007 [Person in bear costume]]
You there―the ones dressed all weird![n]Get outta our way, right now!

[msg MSG_008 [Morgana]]
What!? You're the one dressed weird!

[msg MSG_009 [Person in bear costume]]
We're in a hurry here! Enough chit-chat,[n]let us through!
If you won't listen, then don't blame me[n]if I bust out my Persona!

[msg MSG_010 [Ryuji]]
You... know about Personas!?

[msg MSG_011 [Reserved girl]]
Huh? Do you know how to use Personas[n]too?

[msg MSG_012 [Akechi]]
Perhaps we could consider each other[n]compatriots instead of enemies―we're[n]Persona-users as well.

[msg MSG_013 [Composed boy]]
You're what!?

[msg MSG_014 [Menacing-looking boy]]
Well, you're the ones packin' heat! You[n]were totally tryin' to off us!

[msg MSG_015 [Yusuke]]
That doesn't shoot bullets. It's a mere[n]model gun.

[msg MSG_016 [Intelligent-looking boy]]
A model gun? Why would you have[n]something like that?

[sel SEL_017 top]
I was just bluffing.
It'd still hurt if I hit him with it.
I sort of forgot it doesn't work.

[msg MSG_018 [Energetic girl]]
Wait, are you serious? That's fake? But,[n]it looks so real!

[msg MSG_019 [Intelligent-looking boy]]
I see... You were attempting to avoid[n]battle with a ruse.

[msg MSG_020 [Menacing-looking boy]]
So, you guys weren't plannin' on[n]fightin' us from the start?

[msg MSG_021 [Energetic girl]]
You were only gonna swat at him!? But,[n]it looks so real...

[msg MSG_022 [Intelligent-looking boy]]
...I see. Perhaps your original intent[n]was to show it off as a bluff.

[msg MSG_023 [Menacing-looking boy]]
So, you guys weren't plannin' on[n]fightin' us from the start?

[msg MSG_024 [Energetic girl]]
Wh-What!? You two looked like you were[n]seriously going at it with each other[n]over there...

[msg MSG_025 [Haru]]
P-Please don't get us wrong! We only[n]intended to use it for intimidation...
We were worried about running into[n]people here, so we hoped that his gun[n]would frighten anyone away.

[msg MSG_026 [Menacing-looking boy]]
So, you guys weren't really plannin' on[n]fightin' us?

[msg MSG_027 [Person in bear costume]]
Huh? Could this masked group really be[n]nothing to fear?

[msg MSG_028 [Ann]]
Hey, why don't we all just chill out for[n]a sec?

[msg MSG_029 [Composed boy]]
Yeah... Sorry about that earlier. We[n]don't really understand the situation[n]we're in either...
We were so desperate to find the exit[n]that we couldn't take any chances of[n]getting ambushed.
Of course, I had no intention of doing[n]you any harm.

[msg MSG_030 [Person in bear costume]]
Sensei, we gotta hurry! Rise-chan's[n]looking worse every minute!

[msg MSG_031 [Limp girl]]
*gasp* *gasp*

[msg MSG_032 [P3 Fem Protag]]
She's sweating buckets! And her face is[n]so pale... Is she sick!?

[msg MSG_033 [Composed boy]]
Yes, she's been poisoned. Do you happen[n]to have any medicine?

[msg MSG_034 [Makoto]]
Sorry, we don't have any kind of[n]antidotes on hand.

[msg MSG_035 [Composed boy]]
I see... It seems to have come from a[n]specific plant here, so the medicine[n]that we had on hand was no use, either.

[msg MSG_036 [Ann]]
Sorry we couldn't help...

[msg MSG_037 [Reserved girl]]
Oh, no―thank you for your concern.

[msg MSG_038 [Energetic girl]]
Oh yeah, one more thing. Have you guys[n]seen anybody that looks similar to us?
He's this boy with hair that like...[n]poofs out on both sides, with a pair of[n]headphones around his neck.

[msg MSG_039 [Makoto]]
No, unfortunately... I'm sorry. I'm sure[n]we'd remember had we seen someone like[n]that...

[msg MSG_040 [P3 Fem Protag]]
So they've been separated from their[n]companion, too...

[msg MSG_041 [Menacing-looking boy]]
Dammit... Was this whole conversation[n]pointless!?

[msg MSG_042 [Akechi]]
One thing is certain: she needs to be[n]treated immediately. We should take her[n]to a place where she can rest safely.

[msg MSG_043 [Makoto]]
True, there may even be effective[n]medicine in the movie theater. Let's[n]head back there right away.

[msg MSG_044 [Energetic girl]]
Huh? A movie theater? You guys found a[n]place like that in the jungle!?

[sel SEL_045 top]
It's a long story.
Just come with us.

[msg MSG_046 [Composed boy]]
...All right. We'll take your word for[n]it.

[msg MSG_047 [Intelligent-looking boy]]
Agreed―there's much that's still[n]unknown, but I'm most concerned about[n]Rise-san's current condition.

[msg MSG_048 [Morgana]]
Then it's decided! Let's go back to the[n]movie theater! C'mon, follow us!
