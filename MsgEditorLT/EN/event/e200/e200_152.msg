[msg MSG_0000]
We introduced ourselves as well...

[msg MSG_000 [P4 Hero]]
, huh... Nice to meet you. You seem[n]pretty experienced too, so we should[n]make a good team.

[msg MSG_001 [Chie]]
Yep yep! When you told us you're phantom[n]thieves, it didn't make any sense to me[n]at first...
But the more you told us, the more[n]exciting it sounded―it makes me wanna be[n]one, too!

[msg MSG_002 [Kanji]]
Ain't no way that'd work, Chie-senpai.[n]You'd just solve everything with your[n]fists.

[msg MSG_003 [Yukiko]]
Yes, me too! I want to try being a[n]phantom thief!

[msg MSG_004 [Naoto]]
Hmm... I imagine that you'd burst out[n]laughing during an infiltration and be[n]found out right away, Yukiko-senpai.

[msg MSG_005 [Yukiko]]
It'll be fine. In a worst-case scenario,[n]I'll set everything ablaze.

[msg MSG_006 [Naoto]]
Just as I suspected, I don't think[n]you're best-suited to be a phantom[n]thief...

[msg MSG_007 [Cheerful girl]]
Guys!

[msg MSG_008 [P4 Hero]]
Rise! Are you feeling better!?

[msg MSG_009 [Cheerful girl]]
Mmhm, sorry I worried you! Rise is back[n]and better than ever!

[msg MSG_010 [Hikari]]
I'm glad she's recovered...

[msg MSG_011 [Nagi]]
I must say, I'm relieved as well. Still,[n]please don't push yourself too hard just[n]yet.

[msg MSG_012 [Cheerful girl]]
Thanks a ton, Nagi-san! Same to you,[n]Hikari-chan!
I gotta say, I was surprised when I woke[n]up somewhere I didn't recognize―and with[n]a bunch of people in blue clothes...
But, I made sure to introduce myself to[n]everyone! Marie-chan being there was a[n]big help.

[msg MSG_013 [Marie]]
Y-You surprised me too, you know! You[n]just collapsed on us!
...Well, it's fine, if you're better[n]now.

[msg MSG_014 [Futaba]]
Ooh... A picture-perfect blueprint of a[n]tsundere!

[msg MSG_015 [Ryuji]]
H-Hey... It's the real-life Risette!

[sel SEL_016 top]
Yeah.
I dunno who that actually is.
She looks different from on TV...

[msg MSG_017 [Ryuji]]
Man, she is so cute! That sailor uniform[n]totally suits her, too!

[msg MSG_018 [Ryuji]]
Seriously? Her posters are all over the[n]train stations!

[msg MSG_019 [Ryuji]]
She's way cuter in person, right!? She's[n]got this totally different vibe from[n]Ann. Oh man...

[msg MSG_020 [Cheerful girl]]
Oh yeah, I heard a bit about everyone[n]else here and stuff...
But, there's a lot I'm curious about―[n]could I get an update on our current[n]situation first?

[msg MSG_021 [P4 Hero]]
Sounds good. We'd like some more info as[n]well.
Understanding the current situation may[n]help us in our search for Yosuke.

[msg MSG_022 [Akechi]]
That makes sense. It'd be best for us to[n]sort through what we know as well.
Let's explain our circumstances up to[n]now and share intel.

[msg MSG_023 [Morgana]]
Yeah, that's a good idea. Well, first we[n]were all...

[msg MSG_024 [Makoto]]
That covers everything we know.

[msg MSG_025 [P4 Hero]]
I see... I understand the situation now.[n]Let's work together from here on out to[n]solve this case.

[sel SEL_026 top]
We'll make a great team.
You better not slow us down.

[msg MSG_027 [P4 Hero]]
Once again, I hope we get along.

[msg MSG_028 [Ann]]
Don't talk like that to them! We're all[n]companions already, okay?

[msg MSG_029 [Cheerful girl]]
Oh, that's right! I almost forgot.
I'm Rise Kujikawa. I can't fight, but[n]leave the navigation to me!

[msg MSG_030 [Futaba]]
Y-You're... a navigator!?

[msg MSG_031 [Rise]]
Mmhm, sure am!
And if I heard correctly, you are too,[n]right, Futaba-chan? Let's do our best[n]together!

[msg MSG_032 [Futaba]]
Eek! Oh, um... Uhh... I-I'll try―I mean[n]I-I hope we get along!
She's an idol AND she can provide[n]backup? Her specs are off the charts...

[msg MSG_033 [Naoto]]
Still, I'm rather worried about-san's[n]companions.
Um, are you doing okay? I can imagine[n]that you'd feel somewhat lonely being[n]the only one here...

[msg MSG_034 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Ahaha, yeah... I was so surprised when I[n]came to and noticed I was all alone!
But, my companions are all strong.[n]That's why I believe that we'll be[n]safely reunited, eventually.

[msg MSG_035 [Teddie]]
I... I'm so moved! She's so cheerful,[n]even though she's been separated from[n]her friends...
Miss, you can leave it to me! I shall[n]find every single one of them, not only[n]our Yosuke!

[msg MSG_036 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Aw, thanks! I'm counting on you all.

[msg MSG_037 [Morgana]]
Okay, are we done trading info? Then,[n]let's confirm our plan from here on out.
Overall, we need to change the contents[n]of the movies here in the hopes of[n]leaving this bizarre world!
But first, we search for the lost[n]companions!

[msg MSG_038 [Ryuji]]
You don't gotta tell us twice. Heh, I'm[n]startin' to get pumped!

[msg MSG_039 [Margaret]]
Allow us to lend our assistance as well.

[msg MSG_040 [Chie]]
Whoa! She popped out of nowhere again!

[msg MSG_041 [Margaret]]
When set upon a stage, every player must[n]take up some sort of role.
Our role this time is to support you all[n]on this journey...
And Marie says that she'll gladly assist[n]in this.

[msg MSG_042 [Marie]]
What!? I didn't say that!
This is such bullcrap... Ugh, I don't[n]have a choice here, do I?
I don't know what's even possible in[n]this place, but I guess I'll do what I[n]can...

[msg MSG_043 [Margaret]]
Well then, everyone.
While as little as it may be, we will[n]aid you in proceeding through this[n]program.
Won't you come to the Velvet Room for[n]more details?

[msg MSG_044 [P4 Hero]]
Yeah, that should be helpful.

[msg MSG_045 [Margaret]]
We shall be waiting there.

[msg MSG_046 [P4 Hero]]
, let's go check out the Velvet Room.
