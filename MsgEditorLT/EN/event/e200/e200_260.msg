Hmm... Hey guys, hold on a sec.

[msg MSG_002 [Naoto]]
What's the matter?

[msg MSG_003 [Rise]]
I'm getting multiple readings on this[n]floor...

[msg MSG_004 [Kanji]]
Ain't that the dino that got taken away?

[msg MSG_005 [Futaba]]
Hmm... I can't tell for sure myself, but[n]it seems like there are others here,[n]too.

[msg MSG_006 [P4 Hero]]
There are all sorts of lifeforms here.[n]We have no idea what could suddenly[n]appear.

[msg MSG_007 [Morgana]]
That's rightâ€•everyone, make sure you[n]keep yourselves on guard as we move on!
