[msg MSG_000 [Chie]]
We made it! C'mon, let's go set the[n]bait!

[msg MSG_000_3]
We placed the dish upwind from the[n]carnivore...

[msg MSG_000_5 [Makoto]]
I hope the dinosaur can smell it...

[msg MSG_001 [Teddie]]
Hraaaaah! Let the scent of meat reach[n]your nostrils, mighty beast! *blow*[n]*blow* *blow*

[msg MSG_002 [Yosuke]]
Uh, just blowing on the bait with your[n]mouth isn't gonna work from this far―

[msg MSG_003 [Morgana]]
Wha―The dinosaur's sniffing the air!

[msg MSG_004 [Yosuke]]
Whoa, seriously!?

[msg MSG_005 [Rise]]
Look! It's going for it!

[msg MSG_006 [Ann]]
Yes! It's eating the bait! We did it!

[msg MSG_007 [Yusuke]]
Should we use this opportunity to slip[n]past it?

[msg MSG_008 [Futaba]]
Hold up. It's about to finish off the[n]bait.

[msg MSG_009 [Yosuke]]
Already!? All that effort, for[n]nothing...

[msg MSG_010 [Yosuke]]
Wait, what the―it just wandered off?

[msg MSG_011 [Naoto]]
It may well have returned to its nest[n]now that it's had a meal.

[msg MSG_012 [P4 Hero]]
Well, it seems like it all worked out in[n]the end, right?

[msg MSG_013 [P3 Fem Protag]]
You know it! That carnivore's long gone!

[msg MSG_014 [Ryuji]]
Geez, now it feels like it was a waste[n]to let that dinosaur eat our meat.

[msg MSG_015 [Yusuke]]
I agree. The opportunity to feast upon a[n]cut of meat that size comes only once in[n]a lifetime!

[sel SEL_016 top]
Let's try to get some more.
Are there any leftovers?

[msg MSG_017 [Haru]]
Yeah! It was really fun to gather[n]ingredients and cook with everyone.

[msg MSG_018 [Makoto]]
But, gathering those ingredients again[n]could very well put our lives in[n]danger...

[msg MSG_019 [Yusuke]]
I imagine there's at least some meat[n]juice left. I'll go check―

[msg MSG_020 [Makoto]]
Oh no you don't. Mind your manners.

[msg MSG_021 [Chie]]
Oh, we still have tons of that sauce[n]left! It's healthy and tasty―should we[n]bring it back to the theater as a gift?

[msg MSG_022 [Yukiko]]
I wonder if we could serve this at our[n]inn... I might be able to make something[n]similar with conventional ingredients.

[msg MSG_023 [Yosuke]]
Would you forget the sauce!? What are[n]you trying to do anyway, make a jungle[n]version of Mystery Food X!?

[msg MSG_024 [P3 Fem Protag]]
What's Mystery Food X?

[msg MSG_025 [P4 Hero]]
It's... You don't want to know.

[msg MSG_026 [Akechi]]
Sorry to interrupt the conversation, but[n]we don't know when that carnivore might[n]return.

[msg MSG_027 [Morgana]]
Ooh, he's right. C'mon, we'd better get[n]through here as quick as we can!
