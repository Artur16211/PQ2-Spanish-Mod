[msg MSG_000 [Ann]]
Wait! Everyone―stop, stop!

[msg MSG_001 [Morgana]]
What's wrong, Panther!?

[msg MSG_002 [Ann]]
Look, over there―it's a herd of[n]dinosaurs!

[msg MSG_003 [Kanji]]
Whoa, you're right! Should we run, or[n]are we gonna fight 'em!?

[msg MSG_004 [Haru]]
Hold on―that herd... They look like the[n]dinosaurs from the movie trailer.

[msg MSG_005 [Yusuke]]
As I recall, Crow said that the key to[n]changing this movie lies with those[n]dinosaurs.

[msg MSG_006 [Akechi]]
Right. Just as we did before with[n]Kamoshidaman, it seems that we need to[n]change their mentality.
Now, as for how exactly to do that...

[msg MSG_007 [Chie]]
Uhhh, guys―one of 'em is coming this[n]way!

[msg MSG_008 [Dinosaur with headphones]]
*munch munch* Fresh grass is just the[n]best!

[msg MSG_009 [Chie]]
Y-YOSUKE!?

[msg MSG_010 [Haru]]
Huh!? Are you referring to your missing[n]companion?

[msg MSG_011 [Makoto]]
THAT'S Hanamura-kun? He has a human[n]head, but―his body...

[msg MSG_012 [Ryuji]]
Wait, did we even see a dino that looks[n]like him in the trailer?

[msg MSG_013 [Ann]]
No way! We wouldn't have forgotten[n]something like THAT.

[msg MSG_014 [Teddie]]
Yosuke, nooooo! Have you been turned[n]into a dino in the short time we were[n]apart?
Well... I won't let something like this[n]ruin our friendship!

[msg MSG_015 [Kanji]]
Uhhh, that dude's just munchin' away on[n]grass. I don't think he's noticed us at[n]all.

[msg MSG_016 [P4 Hero]]
If he loves greens that much, maybe I[n]should give him a head of cabbage next[n]time I get a chance...

[sel SEL_017 top]
So, that dinosaur is Yosuke?
I'm more of a lettuce man myself.

[msg MSG_018 [P4 Hero]]
That face is definitely his, but... I[n]have no idea why he turned into a[n]dinosaur.

[msg MSG_019 [Haru]]
Maybe he returned to his true self after[n]spending enough time on this island.

[msg MSG_020 [Makoto]]
Come now, he's not some kind of pet that[n]ran away and grew feral. That's[n]impossible... right?

[msg MSG_021 [Yusuke]]
True, cabbage doesn't evoke the same[n]grasslike imagery as lettuce does...
And, while delicious, if you buy a whole[n]head of cabbage when it's on sale, it's[n]difficult to finish before it spoils.

[msg MSG_022 [P4 Hero]]
I know someone with that exact same[n]problem!

[msg MSG_023 [Ann]]
Uh, we don't really care about this[n]cabbage convo.

[msg MSG_024 [Naoto]]
Back to the matter at hand, what exactly[n]could that dinosaur be?
Considering the striking similarities,[n]it seems foolish to think they're[n]unrelated.

[msg MSG_025 [Akechi]]
Your team, these dinosaurs, and this[n]movie... I feel like there must be some[n]kind of connection.
If only we could speak with that[n]dinosaur...

[sel SEL_026 top]
Let's give it a shot.
I can't speak dinosaur.
Go for it, Skull.

[msg MSG_027 [Haru]]
Well, he spoke our language when he was[n]talking to himself, so it very well may[n]work.

[msg MSG_028 [Chie]]
Why don't you just try stuff like,[n]"Raaar," or "Groooo"?

[msg MSG_029 [Haru]]
Well, he spoke our language when he was[n]talking to himself, so I think we'll be[n]fine.

[msg MSG_030 [Ryuji]]
Why me!? If you want a conversation[n]between animals, I can think of someone[n]better...

[msg MSG_031 [Morgana]]
Did you just shoot me a look!?

[msg MSG_032 [Haru]]
Well, he spoke our language when he was[n]talking to himself, so I think we'll be[n]fine.

[msg MSG_033 [Ann]]
What was that!?

[msg MSG_034 [Nervous herbivore]]
Look out! Predators are coming!

[msg MSG_035 [Loud herbivore]]
Aaaaaaah! R-Run for it!

[msg MSG_036 [Dinosaur with headphones]]
Crap, I better run too...
Hup... Whoa―Whoaaaa!

[msg MSG_037 [Yukiko]]
...Oh, he tripped.

[msg MSG_038 [Dinosaur with headphones]]
H-Hnnnnnnghhhh!!!

[msg MSG_039 [Ryuji]]
Wow, he really ate it, didn't he? Look[n]at him, all writhin' in pain.

[msg MSG_040 [P4 Hero]]
That sight... It's truly the spitting[n]image of Yosuke.

[msg MSG_041 [Sulky herbivore]]
It's coming! Everyone, we gotta get out[n]of here!

[msg MSG_042 [Stubborn herbivore]]
Yeah, hurry!

[msg MSG_043 [Morgana]]
Hey, they're all running away and[n]abandoning him!

[msg MSG_044 [Haru]]
Isn't he supposed to be their[n]companion!?

[msg MSG_045 [Dinosaur with headphones]]
Hnnnnghhh... Hrgh...

[msg MSG_046 [P3 Fem Protag]]
At this rate, he's going to get attacked[n]by the enemy! What should we do!?

[msg MSG_047 [Chie]]
We can't just leave him like that―he's[n]got Yosuke's face! We gotta save him!

[msg MSG_048 [P4 Hero]]
Right―let's go!
