Hey, uh, it looks like Zabby's getting[n]pretty tired of waiting for you guys to[n]come find out what she has to say...
She's all huddled up next to the ticket[n]machine... Navigating while she glares[n]at me silently is getting real awkward.

[msg MSG_001 [Ann]]
Oh yeah, she said the machine started[n]shining all of a sudden. Should we head[n]back, Joker?

[sel SEL_002 top]
Yeah, let's head back now.
We'll check it out later.
We'll go when we can.

[msg MSG_003 [Teddie]]
Mmhm, one oughtn't make a lady wait. You[n]must be a gentleman at heart, Joker.

[msg MSG_004 [Teddie]]
Hmm, is this part of some plot to play[n]hard to get? You've got the skills to be[n]a gigolo, Joker...

[msg MSG_005 [Futaba]]
Aw man, that line means you're never[n]gonna show up...

[msg MSG_006 [Teddie]]
Ah, the way you casually dodge matters[n]like that betrays your talents as a[n]gigolo...

[msg MSG_007 [Teddie]]
Looks like a serious rival's appeared―[n]right, Sensei?

[msg MSG_008 [P4 Hero]]
Hm? What do you mean by that?
If she's feeling lonely, isn't it our[n]duty to at least go and spend time with[n]her?

[msg MSG_009 [Futaba]]
Whoa, that was the line of a major[n]player! I bet you're the silver-tongued[n]type of protagonist.

[msg MSG_010 [Morgana]]
I don't really get what you're all[n]talking about―but we should at least go[n]hear what she has to say.
We're at a good stopping point here, so[n]let's head back. We'll resume the search[n]for Yosuke after that.
