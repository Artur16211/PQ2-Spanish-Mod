[msg MSG_000 [Elizabeth]]
Thank you for taking time out of your[n]hectic schedules to come here.
The ticket machine that you've all been[n]waiting for is finally operational.

[msg MSG_001 [Ann]]
Oh yeah, that machine wasn't working[n]earlier.

[msg MSG_002 [Elizabeth]]
That is correct.

[msg MSG_003 [Elizabeth]]
However, the ticket machine now seems to[n]be shining, as if it's received the[n]spark of life...
Did you catch that?
What's that? You missed it? In that[n]case, let's try it once more for those[n]who―

[msg MSG_004 [Ryuji]]
Nah, it's okay! We got it!
What I wanna talk about is that outfit![n]Where'd all the blue stuff go?

[msg MSG_005 [Elizabeth]]
While I swiped―I mean, sifted through[n]the items in storage here, I happened[n]upon this costume.
It seems perfect for my role, so I[n]decided to don it.

[msg MSG_006 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Your role?

[msg MSG_007 [Elizabeth]]
Indeed. Allow me to explain that, along[n]with the circumstances that led to it.
It all started when I was stuffing my[n]face with popcorn and began drifting to[n]sleep...
When―all of a sudden! A bright light[n]shot forth from this ticket machine!

[msg MSG_008 [Ryuji]]
So, while we were in there busting our[n]asses, this woman was munching away on[n]popcorn and napping...

[msg MSG_009 [Elizabeth]]
This light that I beheld was so nearly[n]blinding, I had no choice but to wipe up[n]my drool and rise to my feet!

[msg MSG_010 [Naoto]]
It almost feels like she's blaming us[n]for this event...

[msg MSG_011 [Teddie]]
Soooo, what does this ticket machine do,[n]Miss?

[msg MSG_012 [Elizabeth]]
It can now issue "Special Screening"[n]tickets.

[msg MSG_013 [P4 Hero]]
What's a special screening?

[msg MSG_014 [Elizabeth]]
If "Kamoshidaman" is a full-length[n]feature film, then the special[n]screenings can be seen as short films.
Your goal isn't to change the endings―[n]instead, accomplishing the goals set for[n]them will end the screenings...
...That's what it said in the[n]"instruction manual."

[sel SEL_015 top]
Instruction manual?
That makes no sense whatsoever.

[msg MSG_016 [Elizabeth]]
Yes, how fortunate that it was attached[n]to the machine itself.

[msg MSG_017 [Elizabeth]]
I understand what you're saying, but[n]when all is said and done, these are the[n]instructions attached to the machine...

[msg MSG_018 [Makoto]]
So, these special screenings: will[n]something happen if we complete them?

[msg MSG_019 [Elizabeth]]
If you report your success back to me, I[n]shall prepare an ultra-extravagant[n]reward for your endeavor.

[msg MSG_020 [Yusuke]]
Extravagant, you say?

[msg MSG_021 [Futaba]]
See? Isn't this "cheek-droopingly"[n]great? I have no idea why she's doing so[n]much for us, though.

[msg MSG_022 [Elizabeth]]
とみ と ぼぺょ ゐもろょまれれ ぺょ もょろるもむゎもょむ ゆよわもまデ ろめまょ[n]ろめもれ もれ ぺ れゆぺゅゅ らるもぼま ろよ らぺをテ はゅまぺれま ぼよょれもぽまる[n]もろ ぺ ろよやまょ よみ ゆを むるぺろもろゎぽまテ

[msg MSG_023 [P4 Hero]]
...She's way too into this.

[msg MSG_024 [Elizabeth]]
According to the manual, it seems I am[n]now appointed to issue tickets and[n]manage relevant affairs.
Basically, I am the vendor here... More[n]specifically, it makes me the box[n]office's booth babe!
Thus, I followed these instructions and[n]TRANSFOOOORMED! ...into this attire.

[sel SEL_025 top]
It suits you.
I want to wear one too.

[msg MSG_026 [Elizabeth]]
Dear me, what colossally pleasing[n]words... I am now even more fired up to[n]do this.

[msg MSG_027 [Elizabeth]]
Oh my... I must apologize. There is only[n]one of these costumes, and no spare to[n]be found.

[msg MSG_028 [Ryuji]]
Wha―Why're you tryin' to wear it? And[n]why do you look so disappointed with her[n]answer, too!?

[msg MSG_029 [P4 Hero]]
We should leave him be...

[msg MSG_030 [Elizabeth]]
It just so happens that a ticket can be[n]issued at this moment, so let's give it[n]a try without delay...

[msg MSG_031 [Yusuke]]
...Hm? Nothing's printed on this ticket.

[msg MSG_032 [Elizabeth]]
Supposedly, the ticket's details will[n]naturally develop upon your entrance[n]into the movie...
This particular special screening[n]requires you to strike down enemies as[n]if they were flies.
In particular, you must "defeat eight[n]Basalts."

[msg MSG_033 [Futaba]]
Mmhm? And what's the reward for this[n]screening?

[msg MSG_034 [Elizabeth]]
In the event that you succeed, you will[n]receive a monetary reward...
Not only that―a "Healing Armlet" that[n]can be made from materials dropped by[n]those enemies will appear in the shop.

[msg MSG_035 [Akechi]]
What's a Healing Armlet?

[msg MSG_036 [Elizabeth]]
It's an exceptional accessory that[n]enables the use of a healing spell to[n]whoever equips it...
Such hyper-ultra-amazing equipment will[n]soon become purchasable in a concession[n]stand near you!

[msg MSG_037 [Ryuji]]
Wait―we gotta pay for it!?

[msg MSG_038 [Yusuke]]
Offering a reward, and then making us[n]purchase said reward... It seems you're[n]quite the skilled merchant.

[msg MSG_039 [P4 Hero]]
But, new equipment like that would be[n]helpful―it'd improve our odds in battle,[n]too...

[msg MSG_040 [Haru]]
These special screenings sound useful,[n]so why don't we try this one?

[sel SEL_041 top]
Alright.
If we can find the time for it.

[msg MSG_042 [Makoto]]
If we can increase our battle potential[n]with these rewards, they'll help us[n]speed up our exploration efforts...
Not only that―if we engage in activities[n]that differ from our usual efforts, they[n]should help us get stronger as well.
にまろ'れ ゐよるや ろめるよゎむめ ろめまれま れめよるろ みもゅゆれ ゐめもゅま ゐま[n]らるよむるまれれ ろめるよゎむめ ろめま ゆよわもまれ― だみろまる ぺゅゅデ れゅよゐ[n]ぺょぽ れろまぺぽを ゐもょれ ろめま るぺぼまテ

[msg MSG_043 [Elizabeth]]
By the by, these tickets have no[n]particular time limit.
If you wish to view a different special[n]screening, it's possible to cancel any[n]already-printed tickets.
Reissues of such canceled screenings are[n]also available to you.

[msg MSG_044 [Futaba]]
I see, so we really do get to do these[n]at our own pace...

[msg MSG_045 [Elizabeth]]
Well then, everyone: please heartily[n]participate in these special offerings!
