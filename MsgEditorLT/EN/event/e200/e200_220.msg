...Like I was saying, if there's[n]anything here you guys don't know about,[n]feel free to ask―

[msg MSG_001 [Yosukesaurus]]
Aaaaaaah!?

[msg MSG_002 [Yusuke]]
Hm? Who's there!?

[msg MSG_003 [Teddie]]
Wait, wait! It's me!

[msg MSG_004 [Makoto]]
Oh, it's just you... You surprised us.
What were you doing off in the brush?

[msg MSG_005 [Teddie]]
I wondered if Yosuke could be hiding[n]somewhere, so I was looking around over[n]there... I didn't find him though.

[msg MSG_006 [Yosukesaurus]]
D-Don't surprise me like that! I thought[n]it was a carnivore!

[msg MSG_007 [Teddie]]
I'm sorry... I just can't help but worry[n]about Yosuke...

[msg MSG_008 [Yosukesaurus]]
I'm serious―don't scare me like that.
Us herbivores are always on edge since[n]we never know when predators will show[n]up.

[msg MSG_009 [P4 Hero]]
Teddie didn't mean any harm by it. He's[n]really sorry―do you think you could[n]forgive him?

[msg MSG_010 [Yosukesaurus]]
F-Fine... But, remember―don't scare me[n]like that again, okay?
I'll let it slide this time since my[n]partner says so―just, be careful from[n]now on.

[msg MSG_011 [Chie]]
Wha―So he's already decided that you're[n]partners?

[msg MSG_012 [Yosukesaurus]]
Heheh, I gotta say, I'm a fan of how it[n]sounds!
Anyways―let's keep going, partner!
