Ooh, you're back!
Sorry for the rush, but come with me to[n]the box office―the blue chick's calling[n]for us.

[msg MSG_001 [Ann]]
Did something happen?

[msg MSG_002 [Futaba]]
Supposedly she's got something for us so[n]incredible that it'll... "make our[n]cheeks fall to the floor."

[msg MSG_003 [Teddie]]
Make our cheeks do WHAT!?
How awful! I'll make sure to keep your[n]cheeks in place, Futaba-chan!

[msg MSG_004 [Futaba]]
Wh-Whaaa!?
His paws are... fluffy, but plump at the[n]same time...
Do I even detect a pleasant fabric[n]softener scent!?

[msg MSG_005 [Teddie]]
I keep spilling ice cream on me, so[n]Yosuke always gives me a good wash.

[msg MSG_006 [Kanji]]
Yosuke-senpai's real considerate, isn't[n]he...?

[msg MSG_007 [Haru]]
Say, Teddie: how do you get washed?

[msg MSG_008 [Teddie]]
Heheheh... How do YOU think I get[n]sparkling clean?

[sel SEL_009 top]
You go in the washing machine.
He hoses you down outside.
I have no interest in this.

[msg MSG_010 [Futaba]]
So, I guess he just gets tossed in there[n]with some detergent and the rest is[n]automatic?

[msg MSG_011 [Teddie]]
My fur is far too delicate for that kind[n]of treatment! A coat like this can only[n]be hand-washed!

[msg MSG_012 [Futaba]]
And then scrubs him down with a brush?[n]Sounds like a carwash... or maybe more[n]like a Teddiewash.

[msg MSG_013 [Teddie]]
My fur is far too delicate for that kind[n]of treatment! A coat like this can only[n]be hand-washed!

[msg MSG_014 [Futaba]]
Whoa... He's so standoffish that it's[n]macho, in a way.

[msg MSG_015 [Teddie]]
How cold! Please take more interest in[n]me!

[msg MSG_016 [Chie]]
It's a costume. He can take it off.

[msg MSG_017 [Yusuke]]
What... He has...?

[msg MSG_018 [Teddie]]
That's right! I just go like this,[n]aaaaand... Hup-hup, and a hup!

[msg MSG_019 [Teddie]]
Ta-daaaaaah!

[msg MSG_020 [Haru]]
*gasp* Huhhh!?

[msg MSG_021 [Ann]]
There was somebody inside!?

[msg MSG_022 [Teddie]]
のめ ゆをデ ぺるま をよゎ れよ れゎるらるもれまぽ ほを ろめま れゎぽぽまょ[n]ぺららまぺるぺょぼま よみ れゎぼめ ぺ らるまろろを ほよを ろめぺろ をよゎ'るま ぺろ[n]ぺ ゅよれれ みよる ゐよるぽれ? でままめままテテテ

[sel SEL_023 top]
Wow.
And what's inside that?

[msg MSG_024 [Teddie]]
Whaaat!? That's it? Couldn't you, like,[n]fall to your knees in surprise?

[msg MSG_025 [Makoto]]
Um, I'm sorry... It wasn't worth that[n]much of a reaction.

[msg MSG_026 [Teddie]]
What's this? Do you want to get to know[n]me even further?

[msg MSG_027 [Ryuji]]
Uh, not really...

[msg MSG_028 [Teddie]]
So mean!

[msg MSG_029 [Chie]]
Yeah, yeah, enough of this stupidity.[n]Shouldn't Yosuke be more important to us[n]right now?

[msg MSG_030 [Kanji]]
I wonder where he's gone...
I hope he's okay―I mean, he'll be okay,[n]right?

[msg MSG_031 [P4 Hero]]
Yeah. My partner isn't a guy that goes[n]down so easily.

[msg MSG_032 [Naoto]]
We'll just have to continue doing what[n]we can at the moment for now.

[msg MSG_033 [Yukiko]]
Oh! That reminds me, isn't Elizabeth[n]waiting for us? We should get going!

[msg MSG_034 [Teddie]]
Heeeeeey! Don't leave me behiiiiind!

[msg MSG_035 [Morgana]]
Sheesh... What a rowdy bunch. Okay,[n][f 6 1 30 0 0 0], let's go.
