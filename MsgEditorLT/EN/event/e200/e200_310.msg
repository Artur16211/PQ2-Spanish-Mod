[msg MSG_000 [Yosuke]]
Wow, this really is a movie theater![n]And, look at your clothes―they've[n]changed!

[msg MSG_001 [Chie]]
Uh, yeah. We've already covered all[n]this.

[msg MSG_002 [Teddie]]
That's right, Yosuke! You need to catch[n]up with us!

[msg MSG_003 [Yosuke]]
Hey! You guys may have already seen this[n]stuff, but it's still a first for me!

[msg MSG_004 [Elizabeth]]
My my, it seems that Yosuke is rather[n]hot under the collar at the moment.

[msg MSG_005 [Theodore]]
"Hot under..." Sister, should we assist[n]him with his overheating problem?

[msg MSG_006 [Yosuke]]
Whoa! Even more people! Wait, are they[n]part of that army of blue folks you guys[n]mentioned?
Does that mean Marie-chan's here too?

[msg MSG_007 [Teddie]]
You guessed it! Emmy-chaaaan, come out[n]here for a sec!

[msg MSG_008 [Marie]]
Geez, what do you want!? I can hear you[n]just fine without all the yelling!

[msg MSG_009 [Morgana]]
Wow... Things got rowdy real quick.

[msg MSG_010 [P4 Hero]]
Sorry we're so loud. We get this way[n]sometimes... Actually, "always" would be[n]more accurate.

[sel SEL_011 top]
Don't worry about it.
You guys get along well.

[msg MSG_012 [P4 Hero]]
Thanks. I appreciate it.

[msg MSG_013 [P4 Hero]]
Yeah, we get that a lot. It just sort of[n]happens naturally.

[msg MSG_014 [Nagi]]
Welcome back, everyone.
I'm truly relieved that your missing[n]friend was safely found.

[msg MSG_015 [Yosuke]]
Uh, hey, partner―who's the total[n]knockout over there?

[msg MSG_016 [P4 Hero]]
She's the curator we told you about[n]earlier, Nagi-san. That's Hikari-san[n]there with her, too.

[msg MSG_017 [Hikari]]
......

[msg MSG_018 [Nagi]]
Hikari-san, you must be similarly[n]relieved, no? You appeared quite[n]concerned about Hanamura-san...

[msg MSG_019 [Yosuke]]
Man... I'm sorry I had you guys so[n]worried.
Uh, Hikari-chan, was it? Thanks for your[n]concern.

[msg MSG_020 [Hikari]]
U-Um...

[msg MSG_021 [Yosuke]]
Hm? What's up?

[msg MSG_022 [Hikari]]
Why did you protect that herbivore? You[n]could've... gotten yourself killed...

[msg MSG_023 [Yosuke]]
Why, huh? Well, I guess my body just[n]reacted before my brain.

[msg MSG_024 [Hikari]]
...You had no reason? Then, why...?

[msg MSG_025 [Yosuke]]
Oh, make no mistake, it was super scary![n]I almost got eaten alive...
But, more important than that, I felt[n]like I'd live to regret it if I lied to[n]myself there.

[msg MSG_026 [Hikari]]
What... do you mean?

[msg MSG_027 [Yosuke]]
Like, if I fooled myself into taking the[n]easy way out, just to get out of a jam?
Whenever you continually do stuff like[n]that... you start to hate yourself.
I don't want to lie to myself like that[n]anymore―I swore I'd never do it again.

[msg MSG_028 [P4 Hero]]
Yosuke...

[msg MSG_029 [Yosuke]]
...Haha, was that a bit cheesy?

[msg MSG_030 [Teddie]]
Waaaaah! That made my heart all fuzzy!
It was cheesy, but still so cool,[n]Yosuke!

[msg MSG_031 [Kanji]]
Yeah―well said, Yosuke-senpai! That was[n]some Grade-A cheese!

[msg MSG_032 [Yosuke]]
C'mon, stop making me sound like some[n]kinda cheese freak!

[msg MSG_033 [Hikari]]
Lying, to yourself? It makes you... hate[n]yourself?

[msg MSG_034 [Futaba]]
Hikari?

[msg MSG_035 [Hikari]]
The majority decided to abandon her...[n]But, you all went to rescue her anyway,[n]because...
Because you wanted to be true to your[n]feelings?

[sel SEL_036 top]
You got it.
Not really.

[msg MSG_037 [Naoto]]
Well, you risked your life when you[n]stood up to that carnivore...
Wasn't that decision based on your[n]desire to save the herbivore?

[msg MSG_038 [Chie]]
It doesn't matter to me what some[n]majority decides...
I'd never abandon my friends if they[n]were in danger―simple as that!

[msg MSG_039 [Akechi]]
We're not claiming that a majority rule[n]is inherently bad.
When a group decision is necessary, it's[n]only logical to follow the voice of the[n]majority...
But, just because a larger number of[n]people agree on a certain matter, that[n]doesn't necessarily make them right.

[msg MSG_040 [Makoto]]
After all, isn't a vote supposed to be a[n]collection of each participant's honest[n]opinions?
びめま ぺゅろまるょぺろもわま―ほゅもょぽゅを まょぽよるれもょむ ろめま ゆぺゃよるもろを[n]ぺょぽ ぽもれゆもれれもょむ をよゎる よゐょ みままゅもょむれ よょ ろめま[n]ゆぺろろまる―もれ ゃゎれろ ぺほめよるるまょろテ

[msg MSG_041 [Hikari]]
Your honest opinion...

[msg MSG_042 [Futaba]]
...Hikari, does it feel scary for you to[n]be honest with yourself?

[msg MSG_043 [Hikari]]
That... I guess it's possible.
If what I believe is different from what[n]other people believe... they'll think[n]I'm weird.

[msg MSG_044 [Futaba]]
Yeah... I get what you mean.

[msg MSG_045 [Hikari]]
But, you all stick together, even though[n]you're all so different... I think―I'm[n]jealous of that...
...I'm sorry. I can't explain it...

[msg MSG_046 [Nagi]]
Hikari-san... You shouldn't be so hard[n]on yourself.
What's important is what you wish to[n]do―there's no need to stress yourself[n]over what that may be.

[msg MSG_047 [Hikari]]
Okay...

[msg MSG_048 [Naoto]]
Well then, now that we've completed our[n]search for Yosuke-senpai...
What should be our next steps?

[msg MSG_049 [Yukiko]]
To leave this movie theater, we're[n]supposed to change the endings of the[n]movies, right?

[msg MSG_050 [Morgana]]
Yep―no matter what, we're gonna have to[n]go back into the movie.

[msg MSG_051 [Yosuke]]
We're not done with that dinosaur that's[n]got my head, either.
I don't know how to explain it, but if[n]we just ignore them, I swear it's gonna[n]haunt me.

[msg MSG_052 [Haru]]
In that case, let's head back into the[n]movie once we're ready.
