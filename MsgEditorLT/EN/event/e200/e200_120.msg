[msg MSG_000 [Reserved girl]]
Well then, I guess we can finally relax.

[msg MSG_001 [Person in bear costume]]
But wow, Sensei... To think you were[n]acquainted with such a gorgeous lady!
I had no idea! Why couldn't you[n]introduce me to her sooner?

[msg MSG_002 [Energetic girl]]
Okay, okay, we can talk about that[n]later.

[msg MSG_003 [Intelligent-looking boy]]
That's right. Once Rise-san recovers, we[n]need to immediately go back and search[n]for Yosuke-senpai.

[msg MSG_004 [Ryuji]]
Rise...? Rise... Kujikawa?

[msg MSG_004_5 [Ryuji]]
Ohhhhhhhhhhh!

[msg MSG_005 [Ann]]
Hey! Don't yell like that right next to[n]me!

[msg MSG_006 [Ryuji]]
Now I remember! That girl―she's the idol[n]Risette!
Man, I knew I'd seen her somewhere!

[msg MSG_007 [Futaba]]
Yeah, I've been curious too―she's way[n]beyond mere resemblance...
But, that can't be―Risette's not a[n]high-schooler anymore.

[msg MSG_008 [Reserved girl]]
Huh? Rise-chan goes to our high school.
She's taking a break from her show-biz[n]career at the moment.

[msg MSG_009 [Futaba]]
H-Hold on―wait a sec...
The Risette I know is 100% active in the[n]show-biz world!

[msg MSG_010 [Menacing-looking boy]]
...Huh?

[msg MSG_011 [Futaba]]
Eh?

[msg MSG_012 [Intelligent-looking boy]]
Um, excuse me. There's something I'd[n]like to confirm first...
The current year is 2011, correct?

[msg MSG_013 [Ann]]
Huh? You mean, right now? Uhhh... What[n]year is this?

[msg MSG_014 [Yusuke]]
It is most assuredly not 2011.

[msg MSG_015 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Mmhm, that's right. It's the year 2009.

[msg MSG_016 [Energetic girl]]
Wait... So, right now it's not 2011, but[n]2009, but actually 2011!?
Ugh, my brain's all mixed up...

[msg MSG_017 [Composed boy]]
No, I'm pretty sure that it's 2011.[n]What's the meaning of this?

[sel SEL_018 top]
We've come from different times.
It's amnesia.
It's an elaborate prank.

[msg MSG_019 [Composed boy]]
Yeah... That seems to be the case.

[msg MSG_020 [Intelligent-looking boy]]
I don't think that's the case. We've all[n]definitely retained our memories up to[n]this point.

[msg MSG_021 [P3 Fem Protag]]
You know, could we have maybe come from[n]different times?
I mean, I just kind of had the feeling[n]that was the case...

[msg MSG_022 [Menacing-looking boy]]
Ohhh, so this is all some prank! Where's[n]the camera...
More like, of course that ain't it!

[msg MSG_023 [Energetic girl]]
Aha, you're getting better at playing[n]along with jokes!

[msg MSG_024 [Composed boy]]
It would've been nice if this were all[n]just a prank―but that doesn't seem to be[n]the case here.
If what everyone is saying is true, then[n]maybe... we've all come from different[n]times?

[msg MSG_025 [Elizabeth]]
My, my. A rather sizable addition to[n]those who have been guided here.

[msg MSG_026 [Person in bear costume]]
Ooh! Another mysterious new beauty!?

[msg MSG_027 [Elizabeth]]
My name is Elizabeth. We've been here[n]for a short while now.
As for the one standing beside me,[n]introducing him is too much trouble, so[n]we'll simply exclude it.

[msg MSG_028 [Theodore]]
Sister!? Isn't this treatment just a tad[n]too callous!?
Ahem... Please excuse my outburst. My[n]name is Theodore.
Along with my older sisters, Margaret[n]and Elizabeth, I am a resident of the[n]Velvet Room.

[msg MSG_031 [Haru]]
He really is wearing that popcorn[n]outfit...

[msg MSG_032 [Energetic girl]]
Hmm... Popcorn...

[msg MSG_033 [Composed boy]]
We should leave him be...

[msg MSG_034 [Elizabeth]]
It seems we have each been summoned here[n]from different times.

[msg MSG_035 [Akechi]]
Time travel, hm? That's a bit difficult[n]to believe.

[msg MSG_036 [Person in bear costume]]
So, would that mean Team Masks came from[n]our future?
Ooh, I've got a question! Am I a total[n]ladies' man in the future!?

[msg MSG_037 [Ryuji]]
How would we know!? We've got our hands[n]full just takin' care of this cat!

[msg MSG_038 [Morgana]]
Who're you calling a cat!? AND, you're[n]not taking care of me at all!

[msg MSG_039 [Haru]]
Hey, isn't it a bad idea to discuss[n]things like this with each other?

[msg MSG_040 [Intelligent-looking boy]]
Mm, you must be referring to time[n]paradoxes. I suppose those could cause[n]some unforeseen issues.

[msg MSG_041 [Menacing-looking boy]]
Wh―"Thai pair of dachshunds"?

[msg MSG_042 [Akechi]]
The time paradox―it's a famous concept[n]in science fiction.
It's about the currently-unknown effects[n]upon a timeline due to changing its past[n]or future.

[msg MSG_043 [Reserved girl]]
No one knows what happens?

[msg MSG_044 [Akechi]]
Well, no one has succeeded in traveling[n]through time. There are some theories,[n]though.
Such as, not being able to return to[n]one's original world, or one's very[n]existence being erased.

[msg MSG_045 [Energetic girl]]
Yikes! I don't want that happening to[n]me!

[msg MSG_046 [Intelligent-looking boy]]
Basically, that's the reason it's for[n]the best if we don't speak too much[n]about our own time.

[msg MSG_047 [Elizabeth]]
That is indeed a most wise decision.
Knowing too much of the future can[n]instigate new threats.

[msg MSG_048 [Ann]]
Ah, that makes sense.
Plus, wouldn't it be more fun to find[n]out about the future firsthand?
I like imagining what the future could[n]be too, but I still wanna keep the fun[n]for later.

[msg MSG_049 [Energetic girl]]
Yeah! Like, maybe we're gonna enter a[n]bright new world where expensive filets[n]are only one yen per ounce!

[msg MSG_050 [Menacing-looking boy]]
That sounds more like what would happen[n]in some apocalypse...

[msg MSG_051 [Akechi]]
Well then, won't you tell us a bit about[n]yourselves and what led you here?
It may serve as clues for all of us.

[msg MSG_052 [Reserved girl]]
Is that alright? We won't disappear?

[msg MSG_053 [Akechi]]
I'm pretty sure we'll be fine. It's[n]already happened, and furthermore...
This location itself isn't normal,[n]either. I believe such a conversation[n]won't change much, if anything.

[msg MSG_054 [Energetic girl]]
You say that now, but... Anyway, how'd[n]we get here again?

[msg MSG_055 [Composed boy]]
If I recall correctly, we met up like we[n]always do...
