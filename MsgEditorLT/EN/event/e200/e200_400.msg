Ngh... Nnnh...

[msg MSG_001 [Nervous herbivore]]
No way... He lost to the humans?

[msg MSG_002 [Loud herbivore]]
But he's so much bigger than them...[n]Unbelievable...

[msg MSG_003 [Yusuke]]
This proves that some things cannot be[n]presumed from simple appearances, or[n]even common sense.

[msg MSG_004 [Rise]]
More importantly, are you okay? Have you[n]been injured anywhere?

[msg MSG_005 [Yosukesaurus]]
O-Oh... No, I'm fine.
...You went easy on me there, didn't[n]you?

[msg MSG_006 [Morgana]]
We prefer to call it "pulling our[n]punches." It wouldn't do anybody any[n]good to wipe the floor with you.

[msg MSG_007 [Yosukesaurus]]
Heheh, I really am no match for you[n]guys.
I did such terrible things to you,[n]though... Why do you still want to help[n]us out so badly?

[sel SEL_008 top]
No reason in particular.
You looked like you needed it.
I dunno...

[msg MSG_009 [Yosukesaurus]]
Heheh, and you still went and saved us?[n]Compared to you, we're just...

[msg MSG_010 [Yosukesaurus]]
Was that how I looked? Haha... I never[n]would've noticed.

[msg MSG_011 [Teddie]]
Oh, too cool! He's blown me away with[n]his devil-may-care attitude!

[msg MSG_013 [Yosukesaurus]]
We weren't surviving?

[msg MSG_014 [Yusuke]]
Oh dear―it seems you're the only ones[n]who hadn't realized this.

[msg MSG_015 [Yosuke]]
You've all been working together for[n]this whole time, trying for the same[n]goal, right?
Of course you're gonna butt heads[n]sometimes...
But, totally disregarding some people,[n]all because they're in the minority?[n]Isn't that sad?

[msg MSG_016 [Yosukesaurus]]
......

[msg MSG_017 [Kanji]]
I don't really get this kinda stuff...
Like, what's the point in carin' whether[n]you're all the same or not all the time?
Of course different people've got[n]different opinions.

[msg MSG_018 [Yosuke]]
That's right. When it comes to friends,[n]differences don't matter―you just do[n]what you can to help 'em out.
Right, partner?

[msg MSG_019 [P4 Hero]]
Yeah, partner.

[msg MSG_020 [Yosukesaurus]]
I didn't want to be abandoned, so I just[n]went along with everyone else...
But, I've finally come to my senses!
I don't want to belong in any place[n]where I have to lie to fit in!

[msg MSG_021 [Ryuji]]
Yeah, just keep followin' that train of[n]thought.
And make sure you follow it with friends[n]who rely on you, and who you can rely[n]on, too.

[msg MSG_022 [P4 Hero]]
Even I feel weak if I'm standing[n]alone...
But, my friends give me strength. I hope[n]that I do the same for them.

[msg MSG_023 [Nervous herbivore]]
......

[msg MSG_024 [Yosukesaurus]]
So, guys...

[msg MSG_025 [Sulky herbivore]]
Um... We...

[msg MSG_026 [Yosukesaurus]]
Hey, I've got an idea!
Let's stop deciding stuff with majority[n]rule, and actually talk things out from[n]here on!
No more worrying about what others[n]think! I want to stick with you guys,[n]so... Why don't we talk things over?

[msg MSG_027 [Timid herbivore]]
I realized, all I ever thought about was[n]myself―because I was scared of being[n]abandoned too...
I couldn't speak up, and I've always[n]hated myself for being so weak.
I'm sorry for abandoning you... Even[n]though you rescued me...

[msg MSG_028 [Sulky herbivore]]
Me too...
I didn't want to be kicked out, so all I[n]would think about was staying in the[n]majority.
I believe I went too far with you humans[n]as well... I'm sorry for that.

[msg MSG_029 [Loud herbivore]]
So, we... We all felt the same way about[n]this...

[msg MSG_030 [Nervous herbivore]]

[msg MSG_031 [Yusuke]]
Now that they're no longer hiding behind[n]numbers, we finally get to hear[n]everyone's true feelings.

[msg MSG_032 [Yosukesaurus]]
I think majority rule can be a useful[n]way to make a decision...
But let's not make sticking to it our[n]top priority. What say we search for[n]other ways to guide ourselves?

[msg MSG_033 [Timid herbivore]]
...Yeah!

[msg MSG_034 [Chie]]
Heheh, and that's a wrap!

[msg MSG_035 [Haru]]
I suppose this case is closed now?

[msg MSG_036 [Morgana]]
...Hm? Hey, do you guys hear something?

[msg MSG_037 [Makoto]]
Yeah... It sounds like something[n]approaching from a distance.

[msg MSG_038 [Rise]]
Guys―bad news! A powerful presence is[n]closing in at high speed!
I think it's a carnivore... Be careful!

[msg MSG_039 [Naoto]]
Seems like it's finally tracked us down.[n]Should we stand our ground?

[msg MSG_040 [Futaba]]
The real problem's the herbivores...
Even if we tried to get them outta[n]there, you're cornered in a dead end!

[msg MSG_041 [Timid herbivore]]
Should we hide!?

[msg MSG_042 [Nervous herbivore]]
W-We've gotta run!

[msg MSG_043 [Loud herbivore]]
But, where!? We don't have a way out of[n]here!

[msg MSG_044 [Yosukesaurus]]
H-Hey! Calm down, everyone!

[msg MSG_045 [Futaba]]
It's no use! Incoming!

[msg MSG_046 [Gaudy carnivore]]
GREEEEEEEEE!

[msg MSG_047 [Morgana]]
Tch, it's here. Joker! What do we do!?

[sel SEL_048 top]
We need to act―fast.
Let's see how this plays out.

[msg MSG_049 [P4 Hero]]
All right―let's take the front line.

[msg MSG_050 [P4 Hero]]
I'm not certain about that... It doesn't[n]seem like we have any time to spare.

[msg MSG_051 [Gaudy carnivore]]
GYAAAAAAAH!

[msg MSG_052 [Yosukesaurus]]
Wait a sec! Do you think you could let[n]me handle this?

[msg MSG_053 [Yosuke]]
Huh!? Do you know how ridiculous that[n]sounds!?

[msg MSG_054 [Yosukesaurus]]
Heheh―all you've seen until now is how[n]lame I've been...
Let me prove I've got what it takes too!

[msg MSG_055 [Kanji]]
H-Hey, what're you gonna do!?

[msg MSG_056 [Yosukesaurus]]
I-I...
I've made up my mind: I'm going to be[n]honest with my own feelings!

[msg MSG_057 [Sulky herbivore]]
Wh-What are you thinking? If we don't[n]get outta here fast, we'll all be[n]killed!

[msg MSG_058 [Yosukesaurus]]
Well, I'm a dinosaur too!
If I try my hardest, I should be able to[n]drive off a single carnivore!

[msg MSG_059 [Timid herbivore]]
But, th-that's impossible!

[msg MSG_060 [Yosukesaurus]]
After all this time, we're finally being[n]honest with each other!
There's no way I'm abandoning my[n]companions in danger now―not ever again!

[msg MSG_061 [Loud herbivore]]
Wait, you're kidding, right!?
