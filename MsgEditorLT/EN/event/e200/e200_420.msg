[msg MSG_000 [Timid herbivore]]
We... won against the carnivore?[n]Unbelievable...

[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
We knew you could do it!
Things turned out this way all because[n]you tried your hardest, huh?

[msg MSG_002 [Sulky herbivore]]
But more importantly, what were you[n]thinking, charging at that carnivore all[n]by yourself!?

[msg MSG_003 [Yosukesaurus]]
Haha, I guess I just got too heated...
But, it made me real happy that you all[n]fought alongside me.

[msg MSG_004 [Loud herbivore]]
*sigh* We're companions, aren't we? It's[n]only natural that we helped out.

[msg MSG_005 [Nervous herbivore]]
Let's work together from here on, okay?

[msg MSG_006 [Yosukesaurus]]
Y-You guys!

[msg MSG_007 [Sulky herbivore]]
Also... we ought to thank the humans.

[msg MSG_008 [Yosukesaurus]]
Oh, right! I'm sorry we dragged you all[n]into this.

[sel SEL_009 top]
Oh, that? It was nothing.
You were really cool back there.
You really moved us.

[msg MSG_010 [Yosukesaurus]]
Haha, you really are amazing...
We swear, we'll try to get as strong as[n]you guys are one day!

[msg MSG_011 [Yosukesaurus]]
F-For real? Cool!? It didn't feel like a[n]disappointment to you!?
Well, not to toot my own horn or[n]anything, but I was the most kickass[n]one, right?

[msg MSG_012 [Chie]]
Sheesh... I still haven't gotten over[n]how much he's like the real Yosuke.

[msg MSG_013 [Naoto]]
But, there's no doubt that your[n]initiative is what moved everyone else[n]to action...
And, what moved us was your passion.

[msg MSG_014 [Futaba]]
I know, right? It was as heartfelt as[n]some coming-of-age manga!
Seriously though, it was a bit of a tear[n]jerker. I was providing backup with[n]tissues in one hand.

[msg MSG_015 [Yusuke]]
Now I wonder... what are you going to do[n]from here on out?
After all, didn't we learn that there is[n]no paradise for herbivores here?

[msg MSG_016 [Yosukesaurus]]
I-I forgot about that! *sigh* What're we[n]supposed to do now?

[msg MSG_017 [Yosuke]]
If you're looking for a safe haven, all[n]you gotta do is make one together.
It's not something given to you, or that[n]you'd just stumble upon somewhere...
You have to make an effort to secure it,[n]just like you and I did when it came to[n]our companions!

[msg MSG_018 [Yosukesaurus]]
......!

[msg MSG_019 [Teddie]]
Yo... Yosukeeeee!!!

[msg MSG_020 [Yosuke]]
Agh! Don't tackle me like that outta[n]nowhere!

[msg MSG_021 [Teddie]]
Waaaaaah... My own bearadise is right by[n]your and everyone else's sides!

[msg MSG_022 [Yosuke]]
Alright, alright! I get it―just lemme[n]go!
Wait―did you spill juice on yourself[n]again!? You're all sticky!

[msg MSG_023 [Teddie]]
It's not just juice. I also got a bunch[n]of popcorn in my suit, and―

[msg MSG_024 [Yosuke]]
Learn how to clean yourself before you[n]wind up full of bugs!

[msg MSG_025 [P3 Fem Protag]]
*chuckle*
Ah, companions you can share a laugh[n]with... I wonder how mine are doing[n]right now...

[msg MSG_026 [Ryuji]]
Aw, don't worry about it. They're strong[n]just like you, yeah?

[msg MSG_027 [Haru]]
I wouldn't claim that we're trying to[n]fill their place... but we're here for[n]you.
If there's anything troubling you, feel[n]free to rely on us, [f 6 1 27 0 0 0]-chan.

[msg MSG_028 [Chie]]
Remember what Yosuke said earlier?
Friends and companions do what they can[n]to help each other out!

[msg MSG_029 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Everyone... Thank you.
I think of you as my companions as well,[n]so you can rely on me as much as you[n]need to!

[sel SEL_030 top]
Then, I won't hold back.
Don't push yourself too hard.
Let's see what you've got.

[msg MSG_031 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Mmhm, leave it all to me!

[msg MSG_032 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Don't worry. If I feel like I'm falling[n]behind, I'll just borrow your shoulder[n]to lean on!

[msg MSG_033 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I'll crush any Shadow, one-handed![n]...Heheh, just kidding!

[msg MSG_034 [Akechi]]
Well then, it seems there's nothing else[n]we can do in this movie. Why don't we[n]head back?

[msg MSG_035 [Yosukesaurus]]
...Are you guys leaving?

[msg MSG_036 [Yosuke]]
Yeah, we've got something we have to[n]take care of.

[msg MSG_037 [Yosukesaurus]]
I see... It'll be sad to see you go, but[n]we can't rely on you guys forever,[n]either.
We swear we'll make a safe haven for[n]ourselves one day... Good luck to you[n]guys, too!

[msg MSG_038 [P4 Hero]]
Thanks. Even though we may be apart,[n]we'll still be cheering you on.

[msg MSG_039 [Kanji]]
You better not let those damn carnivores[n]get the better of you!

[msg MSG_040 [Morgana]]
Goodbyes are always hard―but let's head[n]back to the movie theater, folks.
