[msg MSG_000 [Chie]]
We've made it to a new area... Is Yosuke[n]anywhere around here?

[msg MSG_001 [Rise]]
Hmm... Sorry, it seems like I can't find[n]him on my own...

[msg MSG_002 [Naoto]]
No apologies necessary. After all,[n]legwork is a vital part of an[n]investigation as well.

[msg MSG_003 [Yosukesaurus]]
Hey, hey! Can I ask you guys some stuff[n]now?
After all, the whole reason I asked you[n]to join our journey is because I'm so[n]curious about humans!

[msg MSG_004 [Makoto]]
Why so curious?

[msg MSG_005 [Yosukesaurus]]
I mean, humans are the ones who built[n]all the facilities on this island...
I got really obsessed with reading these[n]"book" things in this room I found[n]called "Research Lab."

[sel SEL_006 top]
You can read?
What kinds of books?
You're a real geniusaurus.

[msg MSG_007 [Yosukesaurus]]
Heheh, yeah... Although, I couldn't[n]really understand what they were about.

[msg MSG_008 [Yosukesaurus]]
Let's see... I think it was something[n]abouuuut... DNA-something?
Well, I couldn't really understand it.

[msg MSG_009 [Ann]]
Even still―you can read?

[msg MSG_010 [Yosukesaurus]]
A-A geniusaurus!? Aww, it's nothing THAT[n]amazing...
Then again, to be honest, I couldn't[n]really understand what they were about.

[msg MSG_011 [Ann]]
Even still―you can read?

[msg MSG_012 [Yusuke]]
Considering how he's capable of speech,[n]I suppose his literacy isn't all that[n]strange...

[msg MSG_013 [Yosukesaurus]]
Oh yeah, also that thing! I know about[n]that mysterious thing that moves with[n]electricity!
You call it a machine, right? Do you[n]guys make stuff like that, too?

[msg MSG_014 [Yukiko]]
Hmm, that would be impossible for me. I[n]think Naoto-kun might be able to,[n]though.

[msg MSG_015 [Morgana]]
I can make simple ones too!

[msg MSG_016 [Yosukesaurus]]
For real!? That's amazing!

[msg MSG_017 [Kanji]]
The other dinosaurs are quiet as mice,[n]but this one won't stop runnin' his[n]mouth.

[msg MSG_018 [Chie]]
I guess it makes sense... He does have[n]the same face as Yosuke.

[msg MSG_019 [Teddie]]
He gets carried away real easily, too―[n]exactly like our own Yosuke.

[msg MSG_020 [Yosukesaurus]]
Ooh, and―and―you guys can eat both meat[n]and grass, right?

[msg MSG_021 [Yukiko]]
Well, you tend to only eat meat, right,[n]Chie?

[msg MSG_022 [Chie]]
A-yep. There's no room to spare for[n]greens and veggies in here!

[msg MSG_023 [Yosukesaurus]]
Huh!? Does that mean humans are actually[n]solely carnivorous?

[sel SEL_024 top]
Yes... We are...
No, we eat vegetables too.
I prefer carbs.

[msg MSG_025 [Makoto]]
Hey, don't scare him like that! Humans[n]will basically eat anything, depending[n]on what they prefer.

[msg MSG_026 [Yusuke]]
Absolutely. Meat and vegetables shine[n]the most when paired with rice to make[n]for a more filling meal.
Balance is vital to both food and art...[n]Unlike some, I will eat anything to[n]balance my diet!

[msg MSG_027 [Yosukesaurus]]
What do you mean? You're all humans,[n]so... Aren't you the same?

[msg MSG_028 [Haru]]
Well, everyone has their own likes and[n]dislikes. Some people will even refuse[n]to eat anything except what they like.
Of course, overcoming foods that you[n]dislike is important for growth, too.

[msg MSG_029 [Yosukesaurus]]
Huh. I don't really get it...

[msg MSG_030 [Ryuji]]
All it means is that we can pick what[n]meats or vegetables we eat.

[msg MSG_031 [Yosukesaurus]]
So, humans get to decide things for[n]themselves...

[msg MSG_032 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Sorry, did you say something?

[msg MSG_033 [Yosukesaurus]]
No, nothing! C'mon, let's keep moving!
