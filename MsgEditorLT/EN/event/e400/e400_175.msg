Ah... That was...

[msg MSG_001 [Yukari]]
Wh-What was that? Was that a part of[n]Hikari-chan's memories too?

[msg MSG_002 [Akechi]]
Yes, that was also from her time in[n]elementary school. The speaker called[n]her "Hikari."
And since she called him "Dad," that[n]would mean...

[msg MSG_003 [Hikari]]
Ah... My... Nngh...

[msg MSG_004 [Futaba]]
Are you okay, Hikari? If it's too much[n]for you, just take it easy. Don't push[n]yourself too hard here.

[msg MSG_005 [Hikari]]
I-I'm sorry. I'm just so confused...

[msg MSG_006 [Akechi]]
Since this movie is based on her own[n]recollections, the memories could be[n]muddled or inaccurate.
It may be best to avoid forcing her to[n]remember things, and just let it happen[n]naturally.

[msg MSG_007 [P3 Fem Protag]]
It's okay to take it a bit at a time,[n]Hikari-chan. We'll retrace the past at[n]your own pace, okay?

[msg MSG_008 [Hikari]]
Mmhm, thanks... I'm good to go now,[n]though.
