Dad... Dad, Dad!

[msg MSG_001 [Hikari's father]]
Hikari...

[msg MSG_002 [Ken]]
Huh!? Doe is Hikari-san's dad!?

[msg MSG_003 [Yukari]]
This is really crazy―let's just watch[n]for now.

[msg MSG_004 [Hikari]]
Why... Why couldn't I remember you, Dad?
How could I do such a thing to you?
You only ever supported me, too... I'm[n]so sorry!

[msg MSG_005 [Hikari's father]]
Hikari...

[msg MSG_006 [Hikari]]
Dad... It took some time for me to[n]figure it out...
But, I'm not going to mistreat myself[n]anymore. No matter what other people say[n]about me, I won't deny who I am.
I've learned it's okay for me to simply[n]be myself. Everyone here taught me[n]that―and you did too, Dad.
I won't hide my desires anymore, and[n]I'll work to make my dream come true...
So, please... come see my movie.

[msg MSG_007 [Hikari's father]]
Of course. I'm looking forward to it[n]already.

[msg MSG_008 [Hikari]]
I promise I'll send you this invitation!

[msg MSG_009 [Hikari]]
Ah...

[msg MSG_010 [Yukiko]]
He disappeared...

[msg MSG_011 [Ryuji]]
Wha―Hey, he just vanished! Is something[n]wrong!?

[msg MSG_012 [Rise]]
I'm not totally sure, but it seems[n]alright.
I think that was more like an illusion[n]that Hikari-chan's consciousness had[n]created.

[msg MSG_013 [Ann]]
An illusion?

[msg MSG_014 [Futaba]]
I bet it's the same as what happened in[n]my Palace―he was a false image born from[n]her distorted cognition.
Because Hikari's cognition was warped,[n]Doe took on a form that differed from[n]her dad's true self...
This place seems a little different from[n]the Palaces, but it's definitely related[n]to Hikari's cognition somehow.

[msg MSG_015 [Mitsuru]]
So, because her cognition was corrected,[n]Doe returned to his original appearance[n]resembling her father...
Still, why did Doe look the way he did[n]in the first place?

[msg MSG_016 [Futaba]]
A person's imagination can grow[n]distorted due to their mental state.[n]That's why...
If you only use negative emotions when[n]conceiving others, even your own parents[n]can seem like monsters.

[msg MSG_017 [Yusuke]]
That's right. We've repeatedly seen it[n]in the flesh.

[msg MSG_018 [Hikari]]
Oh... I'm starting to remember...
About my dad and me... It's all coming[n]back...

[msg MSG_019 [Yosuke]]
Need us to lend an ear or two?

[msg MSG_020 [Kanji]]
If you've gotta spill the beans, then go[n]for it. Wouldn't it make you feel[n]better?

[msg MSG_021 [Hikari]]
You'll all... really listen to me?

[sel SEL_022 top]
Of course we will.
Give us the abridged version.

[msg MSG_023 [Hikari]]
Thank you.

[msg MSG_026 [Hikari]]
Ah, alright... I'll do my best.

[msg MSG_027 [P3 Hero]]
It's okay―take your time. Just go at[n]your own pace.

[msg MSG_028 [Hikari]]
My dad's a projectionist. He loves[n]movies, and he's shown me tons of them[n]since I was born.
"Your life is a movie where you have the[n]leading role. That's why you need to[n]make it exceptionally wonderful."
He would always say that while filming[n]me. He told me to be the star...

[msg MSG_029 [Fuuka]]
What a wonderful father.

[msg MSG_030 [Hikari]]
Mmhm. But, before I knew it... I had[n]grown scared of being open with him.
The person that my dad hopes for me to[n]be is a confident one―like the lead in a[n]musical, loved by all...
But I started to think that doesn't suit[n]me, since I was always sticking out like[n]a sore thumb and nervous about it...

[msg MSG_031 [Mitsuru]]
You felt you couldn't let down the[n]person dearest to you...

[msg MSG_032 [Hikari]]
Every time someone criticized my actions[n]or my desires, I would lose more[n]confidence in myself...
I just felt like I couldn't say anything[n]about it to my dad.
Even when the whole class was against me[n]in elementary school, or when I became[n]an outcast in middle school...

[msg MSG_033 [Teddie]]
But, your daddy seemed so worried about[n]you, Hikarin!

[msg MSG_034 [Hikari]]
I think the more he worried about me,[n]the worse I felt about what I was going[n]through.
It only got worse after I entered high[n]school... Even my relatives told me that[n]I was being an inconvenience to my dad.
I didn't want him to hate me or be any[n]trouble for him, so that's why I[n]decided...

[msg MSG_035 [Junpei]]
But... your dad never said that to you[n]straight up, right?
In that case, you shoulda just had a[n]heart-to-heart talk with him about it...

[msg MSG_036 [Haru]]
...It's not always that easy.
You can't worry your father with your[n]problems when he has so many other[n]important responsibilities.

[msg MSG_037 [Morgana]]
Oh, Noir...

[msg MSG_038 [Hikari]]
I felt like I had nearly reached my[n]breaking point... And it was when I was[n]feeling my worst that Dad said to me:
"Why do you have to be like that?"
When I heard that, everything went[n]gray... It felt like he was rejecting me[n]with those words.

[sel SEL_039 top]
You just took it the wrong way.
What an awful father.

[msg MSG_040 [Hikari]]
Yeah. Dad didn't mean it like I'd[n]thought...

[msg MSG_041 [Hikari]]
That's not it―Dad didn't mean it like[n]that...

[msg MSG_042 [Hikari]]
But in that moment, I only blamed myself[n]again―and I felt the snap of the last[n]string holding my heart together.
"Even Dad is disappointed with how I've[n]turned out." I'd convinced myself that[n]was true, so I ran away from it all...
And I created such horrible movies to[n]validate that misbelief... All because I[n]was weak...

[msg MSG_043 [Futaba]]
That's enough―stop blaming yourself![n]It's overkill!
If you keep blaming yourself like that,[n]your heart will die! How would that make[n]your dad happy?

[msg MSG_044 [Hikari]]
Futaba-chan...

[msg MSG_045 [Fuuka]]
Not wanting to let down the people close[n]to you... and not wanting to worry[n]them... I can relate to that.
It keeps you from letting out your true[n]feelings, and you end up trying to deal[n]with everything all by yourself.

[msg MSG_046 [Yosuke]]
So, all of that led to a warped idea of[n]your dad, huh...

[msg MSG_047 [Akechi]]
Now, this is merely personal[n]conjecture...
But perhaps Doe wasn't solely a product[n]of Hikari-san's warped cognition?

[msg MSG_048 [Junpei]]
Huh? Whaddaya mean?

[msg MSG_049 [Akechi]]
Don't you think that Hikari-san and[n]Doe's changes were closely linked?
We thought that Doe produced a key[n]whenever we would change a movie...
But couldn't it be that Doe produced a[n]key whenever Hikari-san's heart changed[n]after finishing a movie?

[msg MSG_050 [Hikari]]
You might be right...
Every time I saw a movie's ending... the[n]feeling that I need to get out of here[n]would grow stronger...

[msg MSG_051 [Naoto]]
If Doe was indeed created by[n]Hikari-san's consciousness, then that[n]feeling would logically follow.

[msg MSG_052 [Akihiko]]
In other words... Hikari's desire to[n]leave this place appeared in the form of[n]her dad.

[msg MSG_053 [Makoto]]
Indeed. I think, somewhere deep inside[n]Hikari-chan's heart, was a desire she[n]couldn't completely discard...
Her desire to believe her father, and to[n]be true to herself in the world...
Those feelings may have been the key to[n]her eventual defiance of these films.

[msg MSG_054 [Naoto]]
I see. That does explain why Doe had[n]those keys.

[msg MSG_055 [Hikari]]
Yeah... I can tell now. I can feel what[n]my heart desires again.

[msg MSG_056 [P4 Hero]]
I see... So, in your own way, you've[n]been fighting this whole time too.

[msg MSG_057 [Hikari]]
And, about that invitation―that was[n]something I wrote when I was younger.
When I first decided I would become a[n]director, I thought about sending it to[n]my dad when my dream came true.

[msg MSG_058 [Aigis]]
That means the invitation was also a[n]form of your desire to defy the warped[n]movies.
When your memory returned and you[n]decided to leave this place, the[n]invitation turned into the final key...

[msg MSG_059 [Hikari]]
Yeah... I'm sure that's it. I definitely[n]didn't want to forget that memory.

[msg MSG_060 [Ryuji]]
Man, I'm impressed! You were down to[n]your last marbles, but you still stood[n]your ground all by yourself.

[msg MSG_061 [Hikari]]
Yes, but... I'm sorry, everyone!

[msg MSG_062 [P3 Hero]]
Huh? What are you sorry for?

[msg MSG_063 [Hikari]]
Well, if I had shown more courage, we[n]could've gotten out of here quicker,[n]right?
I dragged you all into this... I don't[n]know how to apologize for what I've[n]done.

[sel SEL_064 top]
It was quite fun.
It was a rare experience.
We couldn't leave you hanging.
It's fine because you're so cute.

[msg MSG_065 [Haru]]
He's right. Being able to go inside a[n]movie was quite exciting for me as well.

[msg MSG_066 [Teddie]]
Yep, yep. I'm going to get into even[n]more trouble now that I've made my[n]big-screen debut!

[msg MSG_067 [Yosuke]]
Why would you be in trouble?

[msg MSG_068 [Teddie]]
Heheheh... I have the aura of a star, so[n]Nao-chan and the other ladies are going[n]to be head over heels for me.
Soooo, Yosuke, you have to help me[n]design my autograph!

[msg MSG_069 [Yosuke]]
Wait, what? Forget the pointless stuff[n]like that―you need to take your job[n]seriously when we get back to Junes!

[msg MSG_070 [Yukari]]
Ahaha, that's true. I never would've[n]imagined I'd step inside a movie.

[msg MSG_071 [Akihiko]]
Plus, we got to fight some challenging[n]enemies.

[msg MSG_072 [Shinjiro]]
*sigh* You idiot... Go film one on your[n]own time.

[msg MSG_073 [Morgana]]
Right, it's the duty of us Phantom[n]Thieves to help people in trouble.

[msg MSG_074 [Shinjiro]]
I don't think you should let it get to[n]ya too much...
Everyone here's the kinda person who[n]loves pokin' their noses into other[n]people's business, anyway.

[msg MSG_075 [Junpei]]
Uh-huh! Even this guy here―he may look[n]scary, but his consideration for others[n]is at a motherly level...

[msg MSG_076 [Shinjiro]]
What...?

[msg MSG_077 [Hikari]]
Huh!?

[msg MSG_078 [Junpei]]
*whistle* He dropped that line like it[n]was nothing! Nice one, Mr. Slick!

[msg MSG_079 [Morgana]]
Seriously... If you keep getting carried[n]away like that, you're going to end up[n]in real trouble someday.

[msg MSG_080 [Haru]]
*giggle* You're fussing too much,[n]Mona-chan. There's no way Joker would[n]ever do that―right?

[msg MSG_081 [Ann]]
That's right. You'd never make a girl[n]cry―huh, Joker?

[msg MSG_082 [Makoto]]
Yes, the rumors about him being sleazy[n]turned out to be false accusations...[n]Isn't that so?

[msg MSG_083 [P4 Hero]]
Ah―This maelstrom I'm sensing in them...

[msg MSG_084 [P3 Hero]]
Yeah... Joker, you might want to watch[n]your back.

[msg MSG_085 [Hikari]]
Heheh... Ahahahahaha!

[msg MSG_086 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hey! Hikari-chan's laughing!

[msg MSG_087 [Hikari]]
Thank you so much for rescuing my heart.
I promise that once we get out, I'll[n]live my life with my head held high,[n]like all of you.

[msg MSG_088 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Mmhm! And, don't forget―we'll always be[n]together!

[msg MSG_089 [Futaba]]
That's right. Even if we get separated,[n]our hearts will be linked!

[msg MSG_090 [Yukiko]]
The time and place we're all from may be[n]different, but that doesn't change the[n]fact that we're friends now.

[msg MSG_091 [Ken]]
Heheh, this is pretty nice...

[msg MSG_092 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_093 [Aigis]]
And that is a wrap. What a relief!
