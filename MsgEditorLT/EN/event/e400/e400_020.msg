[msg MSG_001 [Yukari]]
So we're going into a musical next?

[msg MSG_001_5 [Yukari]]
Also, wasn't that Hikari-chan singing in[n]the trailer!?

[msg MSG_002 [Yusuke]]
There's no mistaking her appearance...
However, considering the films up to[n]now, she could be someone completely[n]different who only looks like Hikari.

[msg MSG_003 [Mitsuru]]
Also, what happened with that movie[n]title? It was entirely illegible.

[msg MSG_004 [Akihiko]]
It looked like the letters had been[n]scratched out. Were the other movies[n]like that too?

[msg MSG_005 [Haru]]
No, the titles have been legible up[n]until now.
But what could have happened to affect[n]this movie's title?

[msg MSG_006 [Morgana]]
That's not what matters right now. We[n]need to focus on Hikari!
She's in this movie since she was in the[n]trailer, right?

[msg MSG_007 [Futaba]]
Yeah, I can sense her reading now.[n]Hikari's in there, all right!

[msg MSG_008 [P3 Hero]]
Well, now that we know where she is,[n]let's go and get her.

[msg MSG_009 [Nagi]]
Everyone... Hikari-san's safety is in[n]your hands.
Please, try to save her!

[msg MSG_010 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Of course! We promise we'll find her in[n]there.
And we'll all come back together!

[msg MSG_011 [Yukiko]]
Mmhm, there's no need for you to worry,[n]Nagi-san. Right, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]?

[sel SEL_012 top]
Of course.
Let's do this.

[msg MSG_013 [P3 Hero]]
*chuckle* How reassuring.

[msg MSG_014 [P4 Hero]]
Okay, let's get into that movie!
