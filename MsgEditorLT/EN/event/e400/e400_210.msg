Don't let it get to you. I'll help you[n]clean it off.

[msg MSG_002 [Gloomy-looking student]]
...Huh?
Ah―Thank you.
Um...

[msg MSG_003 [Middle school Hikari]]
I'm Hikari. You're Miyuki-chan, right?
Nice to meet you.

[msg MSG_004 [Miyuki]]
Hikari-chan... Um, it's nice to meet you[n]too...

[msg MSG_005 [Miyuki]]
You really like movies, don't you,[n]Hikari-chan?

[msg MSG_006 [Middle school Hikari]]
Mmhm! Even if I've seen it before, I can[n]watch it over and over.
The one I saw the other day had[n]dinosaurs in it! Let's watch it together[n]sometime.

[msg MSG_007 [Miyuki]]
Huh!? Are you sure? I'd love to!

[msg MSG_008 [Middle school Hikari]]
I know! Why don't we all go see it[n]together, then?

[msg MSG_009 [Nervous schoolgirl]]
Huh? Oh, I'll have to pass...

[msg MSG_010 [Loud schoolgirl]]
I've got cram school to get to...

[msg MSG_011 [Sulky schoolgirl]]
Sorry about that! Maybe next time...

[msg MSG_012 [Middle school Hikari]]
I see. That's too bad... but, okay!

[msg MSG_013 [Miyuki]]
......

[msg MSG_014 [Middle school Hikari]]
What happened to my desk...?

[msg MSG_015 [Nervous schoolgirl]]
......

[msg MSG_016 [Middle school Hikari]]
Hey, do you know anything about this?

[msg MSG_017 [Loud schoolgirl]]
Oh boy... It's your own fault, Hikari.

[msg MSG_018 [Middle school Hikari]]
Huh?

[msg MSG_019 [Sulky schoolgirl]]
Didn't you know the popular kids have[n]all started picking on Miyuki?

[msg MSG_020 [Nervous schoolgirl]]
Since you hang out with her, they're[n]after you too now.

[msg MSG_021 [Loud schoolgirl]]
Miyuki, could you just leave us alone?[n]We're gonna end up dragged into this[n]mess too.

[msg MSG_022 [Miyuki]]
Wha―?

[msg MSG_023 [Sulky schoolgirl]]
If Miyuki goes away, I'm sure you won't[n]get hassled anymore, Hikari.

[msg MSG_024 [Middle school Hikari]]
But, that kind of thing doesn't bother[n]me. Let's all just stay friends!

[msg MSG_025 [Loud schoolgirl]]
......
Why do you have to be like that?

[msg MSG_026 [Sulky schoolgirl]]
If you're gonna be like that, then why[n]don't you just take Miyuki's place?

[msg MSG_027 [Middle school Hikari]]
Wait, what!?

[msg MSG_028 [Nervous schoolgirl]]
The popular girls just want someone they[n]can tease...

[msg MSG_029 [Loud schoolgirl]]
If you stick around us, we'll get it[n]too. You're just gonna make trouble for[n]us.

[msg MSG_030 [Miyuki]]
......

[msg MSG_031 [Loud schoolgirl]]
Alright, everybody! Who thinks Hikari[n]should leave our group?

[msg MSG_032 [Sulky schoolgirl]]
Me!

[msg MSG_033 [Nervous schoolgirl]]
Me too...

[msg MSG_034 [Middle school Hikari]]
No... Why?

[msg MSG_035 [Nervous schoolgirl]]
I mean, it's what everyone else is[n]saying, so...

[msg MSG_036 [Sulky schoolgirl]]
Yeah, everyone agrees. You do too,[n]right, Miyuki?

[msg MSG_037 [Miyuki]]
I-I...
......

[msg MSG_038 [Loud schoolgirl]]
Welp, in that case, Miyuki's the one[n]who's out.

[msg MSG_039 [Miyuki]]
W-Wait!
I-I... agree that Hikari-chan should[n]go...

[msg MSG_040 [Loud schoolgirl]]
You see? Everyone agrees, so that's the[n]obvious decision.
