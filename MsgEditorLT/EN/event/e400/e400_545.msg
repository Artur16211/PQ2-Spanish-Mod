Welcome back, everyone! That movie was[n]so great!

I couldn't help but tear up. I'm so glad[n]for you, Hikari-chan...

Everyone... I'm sorry I worried you all.
Let's all leave this theater together.

[msg MSG_009 [Nagi]]

You have acquired the final key, after[n]all. Escape is now wholly possible.

[msg MSG_010 [P4 Hero]]
Yeah, we should take care of that last[n]lock now.

[msg MSG_011 [Hikari]]
Mmhm! Everyone... let's go.
