That guy just now―don't tell me, was[n]that Hikari's...?

[msg MSG_001 [P3 Hero]]
Yeah. She had said that Doe was a being[n]created by the feelings she couldn't get[n]rid of.

[msg MSG_002 [Naoto]]
As for the movie we just saw, that first[n]segment was exactly the same as what[n]we'd seen earlier...
However, the feelings expressed toward[n]Hikari-san were completely different[n]this time.

[msg MSG_003 [Chie]]
Hey, hey! Forget all that for now―how's[n]Hikari-chan!?

[msg MSG_004 [Hikari]]
......

[msg MSG_005 [Aigis]]
No issues with her pulse or blood[n]pressure. I believe she has only lost[n]consciousness temporarily.

[msg MSG_006 [Yukiko]]
Thank goodness... She's okay then.

[msg MSG_007 [Doe]]
Ngh... Nngh...

[msg MSG_008 [Akechi]]
Well then, what should we do with him?[n]There's still a danger of him going[n]berserk again.
I suppose we could at least tie him up,[n]to be safe...

[msg MSG_009 [Hikari]]
Mm...

[msg MSG_010 [Fuuka]]
Oh! It looks like Hikari-chan's coming[n]around!

[msg MSG_011 [Hikari]]
Doe's... not an enemy...

[msg MSG_012 [P3 Fem Protag]]
...Ah. Do you remember now?

[msg MSG_013 [Hikari]]
I know that movie. It's been filming for[n]such a long time...

[sel SEL_014 top]
What movie?
Is that so?
Did you shoot it, Hikari?

[msg MSG_015 [Ken]]
Movie...? Do you mean that black-and-[n]white footage we keep seeing?

[msg MSG_016 [Yosuke]]
Well, now that you mention it, it did[n]seem a lot like a home video...

[msg MSG_017 [Hikari]]
Mmhm... Ever since I was little...

[msg MSG_018 [Hikari]]
No, just the opposite. I'm the one who[n]was always filmed.

[msg MSG_019 [Naoto]]
Then... does that mean the movie was[n]shot by your family?

[msg MSG_020 [Hikari]]
That's right... The one who's always[n]watched over me, standing right by my[n]side...

[msg MSG_021 [Doe]]
Hikari...
