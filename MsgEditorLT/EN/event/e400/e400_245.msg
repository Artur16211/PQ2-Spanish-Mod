You're filming again...
Why do you have to keep filming me?

[msg MSG_001 [Calm man's voice]]
Well, every moment of yours that I film[n]is a precious part of your life's[n]record.
...Listen up, okay? You have the main[n]role in your own life, Hikari.
That's why, well... one could call you[n]the starring actress of your own film.

[msg MSG_002 [Innocent girl]]
...Me?

[msg MSG_003 [Calm man's voice]]
That's right. So, come now. Smile for[n]the camera, won't you?

[msg MSG_004 [Innocent girl]]
......
...I can't. It's embarrassing... You can[n]go ahead and stop filming me now.

[msg MSG_005 [Innocent girl]]
Hey, am I... different from other[n]people? Am I... weird? Is it wrong for[n]me to be like this?

[msg MSG_006 [Calm man's voice]]
What makes you think that?

[msg MSG_007 [Innocent girl]]
......

[msg MSG_008 [Calm man's voice]]
Well... you certainly aren't normal,[n]Hikari.

[msg MSG_009 [Innocent girl]]
Huh!?

[msg MSG_010 [Calm man's voice]]
For me, you're not just normal... You're[n]special.
You're a sweetheart, a sensitive soul,[n]and a bit of a worrywartâ€•plus, your[n]smile reminds me of your mother...
Hikari, it's totally fine to be who you[n]are. You shouldn't think that it's[n]wrong.

[msg MSG_011 [Innocent girl]]
...R-Really?

[msg MSG_012 [Calm man's voice]]
Look, it's only natural that you're[n]different from other people...
You have your own special individuality.[n]It would make me happy if you could see[n]the value in that too.

[msg MSG_013 [Innocent girl]]
Geez... *giggle*
Dad... Do you remember how I told you[n]that I want to make movies?

[msg MSG_014 [Calm man's voice]]
Of course I do.

[msg MSG_015 [Innocent girl]]
If what you told me is true... If you're[n]the lead in your own life...
Then I really do want to become a movie[n]director. I want to record all sorts of[n]people's lives.
Each person has their own story to tell.[n]They all live and think in different[n]ways...
Whether it's fiction or non-fiction, I[n]want to film those different stories...
And if the people watching those movies[n]have a good time or feel happy seeing[n]them, then that would make me happy.
That's what movies did for me... Just[n]like you showed me, Dad.

[msg MSG_016 [Calm man's voice]]
That's such a wonderful dream.

[msg MSG_017 [Innocent girl]]
Yeah, and I'm gonna make sure it comes[n]true!
