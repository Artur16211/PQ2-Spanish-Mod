Was that... Could that have actually[n]happened to Hikari in the past?

[msg MSG_001 [Akechi]]
Yeah. I heard the words "class[n]assembly," so it must've been back when[n]she was in elementary school.

[msg MSG_002 [Yukiko]]
What's right, and what's wrong, huh?

[msg MSG_003 [Naoto]]
It is indeed difficult to judge what is[n]right or wrong when you lack definite[n]rules...
But, that situation just now―that was no[n]different from a dictatorship.

[msg MSG_004 [Ryuji]]
What the teacher says is absolute, eh?[n]No effin' way I'm buyin' THAT one!

[msg MSG_004_5 [Ryuji]]
All they did was push their own selfish[n]decisions on others, just because they[n]were in the majority!

[msg MSG_005 [Elementary school Hikari]]
Teachers aren't allies of the weak.[n]There are no such things as heroes...

[msg MSG_006 [Ken]]
Oh, is that Hikari-san from the past?

[msg MSG_007 [Elementary school Hikari]]
The power to make people do what they're[n]told... My teacher forced me to[n]apologize using that power...

[msg MSG_008 [Hikari?]]
...That's right. My teacher wasn't a[n]hero at all.

[msg MSG_009 [Junpei]]
Wait, what the―Another Hikari-chan? Is[n]she the real one!?

[msg MSG_010 [Futaba]]
There's no question―that one's real!

[msg MSG_011 [Teddie]]
Hikarin, you're safe! I'm going to[n]rescue you this instant!

[msg MSG_012 [Yukari]]
Just wait a sec. Both of them are acting[n]sorta weird...

[msg MSG_013 [Hikari]]
Why did you defy the teacher? You knew[n]you'd only get in more trouble...

[msg MSG_014 [Elementary school Hikari]]
Well... It's because of all the heroes[n]I've seen in movies...
They were strong, and they did the right[n]thing! They helped the weak!
But, I said I was sorry... All because[n]my teacher decided that I was wrong.

[msg MSG_015 [Hikari]]
The words that I wanted to say weren't[n]"I'm sorry"...
The truth is... what I really wanted to[n]say to her was―

[msg MSG_016 [Elementary teacher]]
Hikari-san... Are you still defying me!?

[msg MSG_017 [Elementary teacher]]
Shiratori-san... Are you still defying[n]me!?

[msg MSG_018 [Elementary school Hikari]]
You refused to listen to me...
You didn't even try to understand. You[n]might be a teacher, but you're wrong!

[msg MSG_019 [Elementary teacher]]
Talking back to a teacher...

[msg MSG_020 [Elementary teacher]]
...Uuuuuuunaaaaaacceptabllllle!

[msg MSG_021 [Hikari]]
*shriek* Noooo!

[msg MSG_022 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hikari-chan! Look out!

[msg MSG_023 [Shinjiro]]
Tch, we gotta save her!
