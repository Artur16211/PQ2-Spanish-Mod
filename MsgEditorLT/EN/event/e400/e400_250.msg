[msg MSG_000 [Ryuji]]
Hell yeah! Wrapped that one up real[n]nice.

[msg MSG_001 [Akechi]]
It was just as we suspected, though...
"Junessic Land" was also based on a[n]distorted version of Hikari-san's[n]memories.

[msg MSG_002 [Hikari]]
Yeah...

[msg MSG_003 [Yosuke]]
So that's why the dinosaurs in that[n]movie were all girls―well, uh, most of[n]them. But anyways...

[msg MSG_004 [Makoto]]
That herd of herbivores was based on the[n]circle of classmates that Hikari-chan[n]used to associate with...
And the carnivores were the bullies that[n]went after Hikari-chan's friend group.

[msg MSG_005 [Naoto]]
It seems that one of Hikari-san's[n]friends became the target of some[n]bullies.
びめま よろめまる ぼゅぺれれゆぺろまれ みまぺるまぽ ろめぺろ ろめまを ゐよゎゅぽ[n]れゎみみまる ろめま れぺゆま むるもまみデ れよ ろめまを ろるもまぽ ろよ やもぼや[n]ろめま むもるゅ よゎろ よみ ろめまもる むるよゎらテ
However, Hikari-san was opposed to that,[n]which caused the discord in the group[n]that led to her own exile.

[msg MSG_006 [Kanji]]
So, that's where all that "majority[n]rule" shit in the movie came from, huh?

[msg MSG_007 [Hikari]]
......

[msg MSG_008 [Yukiko]]
They said that the majority is who makes[n]the right decision, and any less popular[n]opinions are simply dismissed...
They never really thought about solving[n]their problems―they just decided what to[n]do based on arbitrary numbers.

[msg MSG_009 [Chie]]
But, why did Yosukesaurus have Yosuke's[n]head?

[sel SEL_010 top]
Their personalities were similar.
He's great at cross-dressing?
Just a coincidence, I guess.

[msg MSG_011 [Yukiko]]
That's what I think too.
Even Yosuke-kun said that the dinosaur[n]reminded him of himself, back when he[n]had just transferred to Inaba.

[msg MSG_012 [P4 Hero]]
...Oh, right.

[msg MSG_013 [Yosuke]]
Why are you buyin' that!? There's no[n]crossdressing to that dinosaur―it just[n]had my head on its body!

[msg MSG_014 [Yukiko]]
I think it's probably because he was[n]similar to Yosuke-kun, back when he[n]first transferred to Inaba.

[msg MSG_015 [P4 Hero]]
There's an old saying that there are[n]three other people in the world who look[n]exactly like you at any given time...

[msg MSG_016 [Yosuke]]
C'mon, what are the odds that one of[n]mine is a human-faced dinosaur!?

[msg MSG_017 [Yukiko]]
I think it's probably because he was[n]similar to Yosuke-kun, back when he[n]first transferred to Inaba.

[msg MSG_018 [Naoto]]
Putting all your effort into reading the[n]room so you can always go along with[n]what everyone else is saying...
This focus was the common ground between[n]the two, so Yosuke-senpai was cast into[n]the role of Yosukesaurus.

[msg MSG_019 [Makoto]]
It's the same reason that Kamoshida[n]became the authority figure in[n]"Kamoshidaman."

[msg MSG_020 [Teddie]]
Basically, Yosuke was picked as the very[n]best person at rolling over for the[n]crowd! Congratulations!

[msg MSG_021 [Yosuke]]
That's not really a compliment...

[msg MSG_022 [Makoto]]
Well, reading the crowd isn't the real[n]issue―the problem is when that approach[n]is taken too far.
I still think any environment that[n]oppresses people into hiding their[n]beliefs is totally wrong.

[msg MSG_023 [Mitsuru]]
I agree. Their treatment of Hikari was[n]nothing but a kangaroo court hiding[n]behind the pretense of majority rule.

[msg MSG_024 [Hikari]]
All I wanted to do was stay friends with[n]Miyuki-chan...
Was that wrong? Was I really just[n]causing trouble for everyone else?

[sel SEL_025 top]
Don't be silly.
You didn't do anything wrong.

[msg MSG_026 [Hikari]]
Huh?

[msg MSG_027 [Haru]]
Had I been in your situation, I think I[n]would've done the same thing,[n]Hikari-chan...
Your desire to support your friend,[n]resulting in something that terrible...[n]It's so sad.

[msg MSG_028 [Ken]]
Obsessing over reactions and hiding your[n]true feelings, or insisting on your own[n]stance and being cast away...
Either way, you still have to endure so[n]much pain...

[msg MSG_029 [Yusuke]]
Indeed, it's the very same as killing[n]your own heart.
But, the Hikari of now ought to be[n]capable of...

[msg MSG_030 [Hikari]]
Yes, I need to keep going. I have to see[n]what waits for me further along.
