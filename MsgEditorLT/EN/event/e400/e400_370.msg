[msg MSG_000 [Morgana]]
Whew... That takes care of that. Are you[n]all right, Hikari?

[msg MSG_001 [Hikari]]
I'm fine, thanks.
So, um... Thanks to you guys, I feel[n]like I'm close to remembering[n]everything.
What I wanted to do, who I wanted to be[n]with... I can actually put that stuff[n]into words now.

[msg MSG_002 [P4 Hero]]
That's great... But, the movie seems[n]like it's not quite over yet.

[msg MSG_003 [Hikari]]
Mmhm... That means I still haven't[n]remembered something... Something[n]important.

[sel SEL_004 top]
If we keep going, you'll get it.
Don't you worry about that.
When will you remember it?

[msg MSG_005 [Shinjiro]]
You heard the man―no need to be hasty.[n]I'm sure you'll remember it all[n]eventually...
Especially if that memory is important[n]to you.

[msg MSG_006 [Morgana]]
Don't rush her, dumbass! We were told[n]not to push her too hard.

[msg MSG_007 [Shinjiro]]
No need to be hasty―I'm sure you'll[n]remember eventually. Especially if that[n]memory is important to you.

[msg MSG_008 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Plus, remember what Oracle said? We're[n]all going to head back home together.

[msg MSG_009 [Hikari]]
Say, [f 6 1 27 0 0 0]-chan... Can I... ask you[n]something?

[msg MSG_010 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hm? What's up?

[msg MSG_011 [Hikari]]
Earlier, you said that you've been[n]scared ever since you got here...
You said you're the only different one,[n]and that you feel like an irregularity.

[msg MSG_012 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Ahaha... Well, about that...

[msg MSG_012_1 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I was just caught up in the moment and[n]vented a bit, but it's really no big[n]deal, okay?

[msg MSG_013 [Mitsuru]]
...If you don't mind, would you be[n]willing to share your feelings with us?

[msg MSG_014 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Umm... How should I put it...
Everyone here has had a role that only[n]they can fill, right?
But, that isn't the case for me. My role[n]was filled by "him," instead...
That's why I couldn't help but think,[n]over and over...
"What's my role here? Am I here because[n]of some kind of mistake?" Stuff like[n]that.

[msg MSG_015 [Hikari]]
B-But it wasn't a mistake!

[msg MSG_016 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Huh?

[msg MSG_017 [Hikari]]
I mean, the people in SEES have all[n]accepted you, [f 6 1 27 0 0 0]-chan. Right?
...I can remember now. I'm certain that[n]I felt the exact same way back home that[n]you do.
The more I thought about stuff like the[n]reason for me being me or why I exist,[n]the more self-confidence I lost...
But, meeting you helped me realize[n]something important. There's no one in[n]this world who has no reason to exist.
It's because you were with me for all[n]this time that I gained the courage to[n]face my fears, [f 6 1 27 0 0 0]-chan.

[msg MSG_018 [P3 Fem Protag]]
...It was because of me?

[sel SEL_019 top]
That's right.
Isn't that your role here?
Even [f 6 1 15 0 0 0] couldn't do it.

[msg MSG_020 [P4 Hero]]
Yeah―no one else is closer to Hikari[n]than you are, [f 6 1 27 0 0 0]-san.

[msg MSG_021 [Aigis]]
You two have uncannily similar[n]specifications...
However, the special position you are in[n]is wholly your own, [f 6 1 27 0 0 0]-san.

[msg MSG_022 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Th-This is kinda embarrassing. I hadn't[n]thought of it as anything useful...
But that's actually a huge relief.[n]Thanks, Hikari-chan!

[msg MSG_023 [Hikari]]
Huh? Oh, yeah... Thank you too.

[msg MSG_024 [Junpei]]
Aww, how beautiful... Friendship truly[n]is touching.

[msg MSG_025 [Teddie]]
I... I can't stop crying either! *sniff*[n]Friendship truly is touching!
*sniffle* *HONK*

[msg MSG_026 [Yosuke]]
Ugh! You moron, can't you blow your nose[n]more politely!?

[msg MSG_027 [Yukari]]
ぶまゅゅデ もろ'れ ょよろ るまぺゅゅを ゅもやま ゎれ ろよ ほま ぺゅゅ[n]ょまむぺろもわまテ とみ ゐま ぼぺょ ほま ゆよるま らよれもろもわま ゅもやま をよゎデ[n]ろめまょ ろめぺろ'れ みよる ろめま ほまれろデ るもむめろ?

[msg MSG_028 [P3 Hero]]
*chuckle* Yeah, I agree.

[msg MSG_029 [Mitsuru]]
Thank you, [f 6 1 26 0 0 0]. I'm glad we were able[n]to hear your true feelings on the[n]matter.

[msg MSG_030 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Eheheh, I wasn't really planning on it,[n]but... I'm glad I said them.

[msg MSG_031 [Mitsuru]]
Well then, we shouldn't remain here for[n]long―let's continue on.
