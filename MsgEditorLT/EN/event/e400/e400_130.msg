We will now begin the class assembly[n]discussing the problem of how our pet[n]rabbit got sick.
Everyone who was in charge of taking[n]care of it, please stand now.

You three were responsible for looking[n]after the rabbit.
Why did something like this happen?

If you had all performed your duties as[n]told, the rabbit wouldn't have gotten[n]sick.
What has happened makes me very sad.

[msg MSG_006 [Timid girl]]
I'm sorry, Teacher...

[msg MSG_007 [Mischievous boy]]
I'm sorry.

Hikari-chan, why are you silent? Weren't[n]you one of the rabbit's caretakers at[n]the time?

[msg MSG_010 [Elementary school teacher]]
Shiratori-san, why are you silent?[n]Weren't you one of the rabbit's[n]caretakers at the time?

[msg MSG_011 [Elementary school Hikari]]
Th-There was a vegetable in the rabbit's[n]food you gave us that's bad for them...
That's what... I told the other two,[n]too...
I said, "We can't give it that[n]vegetable..."

[msg MSG_012 [Elementary school teacher]]
I don't want any excuses!

[msg MSG_013 [Elementary school teacher]]
Everyone else has apologized―why can't[n]you do the same?

[msg MSG_014 [Elementary school Hikari]]
But... it's the truth!

[msg MSG_015 [Elementary school teacher]]
That doesn't matter! Apologize first!
*sigh* You refuse to listen to your[n]teacher... You have to disrupt the order[n]of the classroom...
Honestly―why do you have to be like[n]that?

[msg MSG_016 [Elementary school Hikari]]
I-I...
