...Hikari, you're such a good girl for[n]trying not to cause any trouble for[n]anyone.
Even when I was gone for such a long[n]time at work, you never raised a single[n]fuss.
I know that I've made you feel lonely so[n]many times, but you still cheered me on[n]with my job.
......
You truly grew up to be a wonderful[n]girl. You're my pride and joy.

Still... it makes me a little sad when I[n]see you force a smile so you won't stand[n]out from the crowd.
I... I want you to live your life to[n]your fullest, however you wish.
Your smile, and your existence... Those[n]are my greatest reasons to live.

[msg MSG_002 [Man with glasses]]
Heheh... This is bad, I'm starting to[n]get embarrassed now, of all times...
Ahem...
I truly look forward to the day I get to[n]see the movie you've made, Hikari.
Your father will always be watching over[n]you. Never forget that.
