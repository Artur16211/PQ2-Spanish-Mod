I knew that was going to be unsavory,[n]but still...

[msg MSG_002 [Kanji]]
I dunno how else to put it―that was some[n]messed-up shit. I can't believe people[n]really did that to her.

[msg MSG_003 [Akihiko]]
All she wanted to do was help her[n]friend, but she ended up getting the[n]boot herself instead...

[msg MSG_004 [Junpei]]
Whoa, whoa! What makes you think a[n]fistfight would solve what we just saw!?

[msg MSG_005 [Aigis]]
I cannot even imagine how much this[n]incident hurt Hikari-san...

[msg MSG_006 [Middle school Hikari]]
What are friends? If our opinions are[n]different... we can't be friends[n]anymore?

[msg MSG_007 [Hikari]]
Why was I friendly with Miyuki-chan in[n]the first place?
Everyone was avoiding her, too...

[msg MSG_008 [Middle school Hikari]]
I once saw a movie―one where dinosaurs[n]worked together on their problems.
It was about these weak dinosaurs that[n]risked their lives to save a companion[n]who had been separated from them.
It was really emotional. It made me[n]think having companions and friends like[n]that would be so nice...

[msg MSG_008_5 [Middle school Hikari]]
That's why, if I ever had a friend in[n]trouble, I would help them, just like in[n]the movie!

[msg MSG_009 [Hikari]]
But everyone else was different... Even[n]Miyuki-chan didn't stand behind me.

[msg MSG_009_5 [Hikari]]
You have to be the same as everyone[n]else. If you step out of line, they[n]treat you like a problem.

[msg MSG_010 [Middle school Hikari]]
Despite that, though... I still wanted[n]to help my friends and companions!

[msg MSG_011 [Hikari]]
If I had just quietly gone along with[n]everyone else, I wouldn't have been[n]treated that way...
But, would doing that... Would I feel[n]all right with myself?

[msg MSG_012 [Sulky schoolgirl]]
Hikari really is such a mood killer.[n]Don't you think so too, Miyuki?

[msg MSG_013 [Miyuki]]
Y-Yeah...

[msg MSG_014 [Middle school Hikari]]
...So what? I don't care if they say I'm[n]a mood killer!
I'm not going to lie to myself―I wanted[n]to stay friends with Miyuki-chan!

[msg MSG_015 [Loud schoolgirl]]
Ugh, shut up already! When it comes to a[n]pain like you...

[msg MSG_016 [Loud schoolgirl]]
We've already voted to kick you[n]ouuuuuuut!

[msg MSG_017 [Hikari]]
Nooo!

[msg MSG_018 [P4 Hero]]
Here it comes―let's go!
