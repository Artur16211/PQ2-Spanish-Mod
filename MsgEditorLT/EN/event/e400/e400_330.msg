[msg MSG_000 [Girl holding camera]]
Oh, Auntie... When did you get here?

[msg MSG_001 [Hikari's aunt]]
Hikari-chan, what were you doing out so[n]late?

[msg MSG_002 [High school Hikari]]
I was just shooting a movie, that's[n]all...

[msg MSG_003 [Hikari's uncle]]
A movie? Great, looks like we know who[n]to blame...

[msg MSG_004 [High school Hikari]]
......

[msg MSG_005 [Hikari's aunt]]
*sigh* This is getting old...
Movies have nothing to do with your[n]future.

[msg MSG_006 [High school Hikari]]
My future?

[msg MSG_007 [Hikari's uncle]]
You know, things like higher education[n]and finding a job.

[msg MSG_008 [High school Hikari]]
Um...

[msg MSG_009 [Hikari's aunt]]
Well, it's not surprising that you can't[n]think of something smart to do yet.
We're just concerned for you―after all,[n]you only have one parent.

[msg MSG_010 [High school Hikari]]
...A director.

[msg MSG_011 [Hikari's uncle]]
What'd you say?

[msg MSG_012 [High school Hikari]]
I'll be a director...

[msg MSG_013 [Hikari's aunt]]
You have got to be kidding me.

[msg MSG_014 [Hikari's uncle]]
Don't tell me―you're not serious about[n]this, are you?

[msg MSG_015 [High school Hikari]]
You're saying... I can't?

[msg MSG_016 [Hikari's aunt]]
Now, listen here: normal people devote[n]themselves to attending a prestigious[n]college and getting a reputable job.
Don't talk like some foolish dreamer.[n]I'm sure your father wouldn't tolerate[n]it, either.

[msg MSG_017 [High school Hikari]]
But, Dad told me that I can try to be[n]whatever I want.

[msg MSG_018 [Hikari's uncle]]
Well, he's busy with his work. He[n]probably doesn't have enough time to[n]have a real conversation about it.

[msg MSG_019 [Hikari's aunt]]
That's why we're here, get it?
It's bad enough that she doesn't have a[n]mother... That fact alone will get[n]people talking behind her back.
That's why we've got to make this girl[n]be normal.

[msg MSG_020 [Hikari's uncle]]
That's right.

[msg MSG_020_5 [Hikari's uncle]]
Well, first we need to first get rid of[n]this hunk of junk.

[msg MSG_021 [High school Hikari]]
S-Stop! This is Dad's camera...!

[msg MSG_022 [Hikari's uncle]]
Are you fighting me!?

[msg MSG_023 [Hikari's aunt]]
Seriously! Why do you have to be like[n]that!?

[msg MSG_024 [Hikari's aunt]]
Just―act normal for once! Nobody can say[n]anything about you if you at least[n]pretend to be normal.
All you need to do is match what[n]everyone else is doing.

[msg MSG_025 [High school Hikari]]
Just do what everyone else does...
I... I...
