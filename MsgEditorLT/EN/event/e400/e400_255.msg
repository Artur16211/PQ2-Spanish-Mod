This again... Was that another one of[n]Hikari's memories?

[msg MSG_001 [P3 Hero]]
It certainly fits the pattern.
The Hikari-san in that clip was the same[n]one from the musical again.

[msg MSG_002 [Yukari]]
But those aren't the same as the[n]musicals though... they're more of an[n]ordinary slice-of-life kinda thing.

[msg MSG_003 [Hikari]]
They feel like my memories... Really[n]precious ones...
But, I can't remember...

[msg MSG_004 [Haru]]
Hikari-chan...

[msg MSG_005 [Hikari]]
Why though? They're my own memories... I[n]want to remember them, but...

[msg MSG_005_5 [Hikari]]
It's almost like... I'm refusing to[n]remember, deep down...

[sel SEL_006 top]
Don't overdo it.
You'll remember eventually.

[msg MSG_007 [Hikari]]
Thanks... I promise I'll get there...

[msg MSG_008 [P4 Hero]]
Rightâ€•you've got us by your side too.[n]Let's go.
