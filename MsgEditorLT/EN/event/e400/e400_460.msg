[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
Aha! So this is where you went!

[msg MSG_002 [Akihiko]]
You can't escape us now. Are you ready[n]to get wrung out!?

[msg MSG_003 [Hikari]]
Wait!

[msg MSG_004 [Futaba]]
Hikari? What's wrong!?

[msg MSG_005 [Hikari]]
I have a favor to ask... Let me speak[n]with Doe first.

[msg MSG_006 [Ken]]
Huh? But, that's dangerous!

[msg MSG_007 [Hikari]]
I'm sorry, but I've got this feeling[n]that I... I need to talk to him.

[sel SEL_008 top]
Alright.
Just be careful.

[msg MSG_009 [Hikari]]
...Thanks, everyone.

[msg MSG_010 [Doe]]
......

[msg MSG_011 [Hikari]]
I'm sorry I had forgotten you all this[n]time...
You're my feelings that I couldn't[n]completely discard. I created you, in a[n]way... Isn't that right?

[msg MSG_012 [Kanji]]
WHAT!?

[msg MSG_013 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Kanji-kun, shh! Let's just watch what[n]happens, okay?

[msg MSG_014 [Hikari]]
I haven't remembered everything yet...[n]but I can tell.

[msg MSG_015 [Doe]]
I have always watched you. Always and[n]always.

[msg MSG_016 [Hikari]]
...I was afraid of you.
I couldn't even look at you... I was too[n]scared to face you.
But now, I finally remember why.
I was trying to destroy my heart, and I[n]was afraid of you seeing that...

[msg MSG_017 [Doe]]
That's right. You ran from me. So you[n]wouldn't get hurt.

[msg MSG_018 [Hikari]]
I didn't want you to see me like this.
I wanted to make myself believe that[n]there was nothing else I could do about[n]how I am.
That's why I just kept watching those[n]distorted movies―to convince myself of[n]that.

[msg MSG_019 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hikari-chan...

[msg MSG_020 [Hikari]]
Still... I couldn't completely discard[n]who I am deep down inside.
I... I couldn't forget you. I knew that[n]I didn't really want to forget you.

[msg MSG_021 [Doe]]
Now that you know. What do you want to[n]do?

[msg MSG_022 [Hikari]]
I-I... I want to leave this place. I'll[n]change this movie's ending and get out[n]of here.

[msg MSG_023 [Doe]]
Do you have the willpower to do that?
It wasn't your own strength that brought[n]you here. Can you do it when you're so[n]weak compared to the others?

[msg MSG_024 [Hikari]]
......!

[msg MSG_025 [Doe]]
Remember your weakness that made you[n]run. All because you couldn't face it.
If you throw your self away, no one can[n]criticize you. Don't you want to avoid[n]getting hurt?

[msg MSG_026 [Hikari]]
Th-That's not true... That's...
Please, stop!

[sel SEL_027 top]
Hang in there!
We're right behind you.

[msg MSG_028 [P4 Hero]]
That's right, you're not alone. There's[n]no need to suffer all by yourself.

[msg MSG_029 [Morgana]]
Yeah, don't forget about us!

[msg MSG_030 [Hikari]]
Everyone...

[msg MSG_031 [Doe]]
Nnnghh... Ngh... Yaaaaaaaaaaaaugh!

[msg MSG_032 [P3 Hero]]
What the―!?
