What the hell is all of this?

[msg MSG_001 [Yukiko]]
The atmosphere of the movie's totally[n]changed with the genre again.
There are a lot of music notes flying[n]around... I guess that has to do with[n]this being a musical?

[msg MSG_002 [Yukari]]
It's kinda cute at first glance, but...[n]isn't there something odd about it?
It reminds me of a theme park, but it[n]feels creepy for some reason...

[msg MSG_003 [Fuuka]]
I get what you mean, Yukari-chan.
It's so bright here, but there's[n]something chilling and spooky about it[n]all―even sort of ominous...

[msg MSG_004 [Yusuke]]
That has been bothering me as well. This[n]world is unsettling.
Don't you sense something about it as[n]well, Joker?

[sel SEL_005 top]
It's suffocating.
It's hurting my eyes.
I don't notice anything.

[msg MSG_006 [Yusuke]]
Indeed. Even if you find it displeasing,[n]you're forced to suppress your feelings[n]and accept this world as it is.
I'm sensing a great deal of[n]intrusiveness and compulsion from this[n]artistic approach as well...

[msg MSG_007 [Haru]]
True, the colors here are bright enough[n]to nearly blind you...

[msg MSG_008 [Yusuke]]
This gaudy, toxic coloring... It feels[n]so oppressive.
Even if you find it displeasing, you're[n]forced to suppress your feelings and[n]accept this world as it is.

[msg MSG_009 [Yusuke]]
I see. I'm sensing something like an[n]intrusiveness and compulsion from this[n]artistic approach...
Even if you find it displeasing, you're[n]forced to suppress your feelings and[n]accept this world as it is.
That's the kind of oppression I see in[n]this stage production.

[msg MSG_010 [Ken]]
When you take a closer look, even the[n]flowers around here look all distorted.[n]It's pretty disturbing.

[msg MSG_011 [Naoto]]
Could that mean this place symbolizes an[n]artificial happiness?

[msg MSG_012 [Akechi]]
They did say in the trailer, "Lose your[n]individuality. Forget who you are, and[n]follow the crowd."
It seems this place is no different from[n]the previous films―and, in that case,[n]this movie is also...

[msg MSG_013 [Junpei]]
Hmm? This movie is also what?
I mean, we haven't seen any of the[n]trailers until now―what're we supposed[n]to do here?

[msg MSG_014 [Akechi]]
Well... I don't have any conclusive[n]evidence yet.
I don't want to cause any pointless[n]confusion either, so let's gather more[n]intel first.

[msg MSG_015 [Teddie]]
Oh myyyyy! You're such a reliable boy,[n]Crow!

[msg MSG_016 [Akechi]]
Hrggh! I-I can't breathe... please,[n]cease your glomping...

[msg MSG_017 [Naoto]]
In any case, let's do as Crow says and[n]try to learn more about our current[n]situation.

[msg MSG_018 [Futaba]]
That sounds best. We really shouldn't[n]judge this movie based on its looks.
This place is way more wackadoo than I[n]expected.

[msg MSG_019 [Rise]]
These Shadows are extra vicious compared[n]to the ones we've faced so far...
Be careful, guys!

[sel SEL_020 top]
Let's hurry!
Let's be careful.
I'm worried about Hikari.

[msg MSG_021 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Mmhm! We should hurry and look for[n]Hikari-chan!

[msg MSG_022 [P4 Hero]]
Calm as ever―quite impressive. It's true[n]that all our efforts would be for[n]nothing if we get taken out here.

[msg MSG_023 [P3 Fem Protag]]
But, I wonder if Hikari-chan will be[n]okay... I'm worried.

[msg MSG_024 [P3 Hero]]
Yeah―unlike us, she has no means of[n]fighting...
We should hurry and go look for her.

[msg MSG_025 [Morgana]]
You'd better not let your guard down,[n]okay? Let's proceed with maximum[n]caution!
