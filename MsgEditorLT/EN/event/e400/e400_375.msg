Whoa, are you alright!? You've gone so[n]pale!

[msg MSG_002 [Hikari]]
Why... Why...?

[msg MSG_003 [Morgana]]
Hey, Hikari!?

[msg MSG_004 [Aigis]]
Hikari-san's rejection of her memory has[n]grown stronger than ever before.
I believe it would be best to let her[n]rest for a time.

[msg MSG_005 [Hikari]]
I-I'm sorry... I'm okay now.
More importantly, I want to keep going.[n]Please, while I still can...

[msg MSG_006 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hikari-chan...
...Well, alright. But don't push[n]yourself too hard, okay? You have to[n]promise.

[msg MSG_007 [Hikari]]
Okay, I won't... Thank you.
