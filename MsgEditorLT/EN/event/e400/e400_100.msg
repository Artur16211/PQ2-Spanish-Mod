[msg MSG_001 [Akechi]]
Is something on your mind?

[msg MSG_002 [Naoto]]
Yes―why did Doe take Hikari-san into the[n]movie now, of all times?
I just can't think of a motive...

[msg MSG_003 [Ryuji]]
Well, he's obviously the one who locked[n]us all up here, yeah?
Since we keep changin' the movies and[n]tryin' to get out, maybe he freaked out?

[msg MSG_004 [Naoto]]
That's what I still can't figure out―if[n]we suppose that Doe is the culprit, then[n]what is his goal?
He's never attacked us until now, and so[n]much time passed before he kidnapped[n]Hikari-san...

[msg MSG_005 [Akechi]]
I can't discern his endgame either.
Furthermore, why was he playing the[n]movies for us in the first place?

[sel SEL_006 top]
He wanted us to watch them.
He wanted us to change them.
I don't know.

[msg MSG_007 [Naoto]]
Then, that invitation Hikari-san had...[n]Was that sent by Doe as well?

[msg MSG_008 [Naoto]]
I can't help but agree with that[n]assessment.
And, I suspect that the invitation[n]Hikari-san had wasn't Doe's doing.

[msg MSG_009 [Akechi]]
That's a good point. It's frustrating,[n]but our conjectures lack any decisive[n]facts.

[msg MSG_010 [Naoto]]
Speaking of what we don't know, there's[n]also that invitation Hikari-san had...
Was that Doe's doing as well?

[msg MSG_011 [Akechi]]
If he's trying to get us to merely watch[n]the movies...
We keep altering them, so it wouldn't be[n]surprising if he considers us to be a[n]hindrance.

[msg MSG_012 [Mitsuru]]
Yet he does nothing besides generating[n]keys and playing different films...
It's almost as if he's taunting us to[n]try and change them.

[msg MSG_013 [Ryuji]]
So, that means Doe's not our enemy?
But Hikari was so scared of the guy![n]He's definitely still suspicious as[n]hell.

[msg MSG_014 [Teddie]]
I'm one baffled bear! If I don't hold my[n]head in place, it might start spinning!

[msg MSG_015 [Chie]]
Hrgh... I-I'm passing on this convo too![n]This all makes no sense!

[msg MSG_016 [Akihiko]]
If we can't figure this out, then all[n]we've gotta do is go ask him directly...
To do that, we just have to keep going,[n]right?

[msg MSG_017 [Shinjiro]]
Sheesh, you're always so―well, actually,[n]you're right for once.

[msg MSG_018 [Ann]]
Well, no matter what we can't just leave[n]Hikari alone with Doe like this!

[msg MSG_019 [Makoto]]
True. We have to find her as quickly as[n]possible!
