Hikari's getting kicked out!

[msg MSG_MOVIE_001]
We're kicking her out because she has to[n]have her own opinions!

[msg MSG_MOVIE_002]
We can't be friends just because we have[n]different opinions?

[msg MSG_MOVIE_003]
Take a hint, why don't you?

[msg MSG_MOVIE_004]
Yeah, that's right!

[msg MSG_MOVIE_005]
Yeah, that's right!

[msg MSG_MOVIE_006]
Yeah, that's right!

[msg MSG_MOVIE_007]
Yeah, that's right!

[msg MSG_MOVIE_008]
Hikari's getting kicked out!

[msg MSG_MOVIE_009]
The side with more people is the right[n]one to follow!

[msg MSG_MOVIE_010]
Then what about other opinions?

[msg MSG_MOVIE_011]
They're just being self-centered!

[msg MSG_MOVIE_012]
Yeah, that's right!

[msg MSG_MOVIE_013]
Yeah, that's right!

[msg MSG_MOVIE_014]
Yeah, that's right!

[msg MSG_MOVIE_015]
Yeah, that's right!

[msg MSG_MOVIE_016]
You're the one who's wrong,[n]Hikari-chan...

[msg MSG_MOVIE_017]
That's right, Miyuki! You are our[n]friend!

[msg MSG_MOVIE_018]
But Hikari is different...

[msg MSG_MOVIE_019]
She's the only one who's different...

[msg MSG_MOVIE_020]
That's why she's not our friend!

[msg MSG_MOVIE_021]
Not our friend!

[msg MSG_MOVIE_022]
Why just me, though...?

[msg MSG_MOVIE_023]
It's your fault, Hikari-chan. You need[n]to go with what everyone else thinks.
