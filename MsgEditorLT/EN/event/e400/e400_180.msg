...Just as I expected, this floor has a[n]musical atmosphere too.
Swaying flowers and musical notes...[n]This place has the same sing-songy feel[n]about it.

[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
Y'know, I've never actually watched a[n]musical.
The people in 'em just start singin' at[n]the drop of a hat, yeah? That's too[n]unrealistic for me...

[msg MSG_002 [Hikari]]
That's not true, though!
Sound films have existed since the 1920s[n]when talking pictures overlaid with[n]music were―

[msg MSG_003 [Ryuji]]
O-Oh, okay...?

[msg MSG_004 [Hikari]]
Oh... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to get[n]loud like that...

[msg MSG_005 [Ryuji]]
Nah, it's fine. I dunno anything about[n]'em, so feel free to lay it on me.

[msg MSG_006 [Hikari]]
*chuckle* Thanks. I'm glad to hear it.

[msg MSG_007 [Yusuke]]
"Put off"!? But, the passion that people[n]display when speaking of what they love[n]is so heartening!

[msg MSG_008 [Yukari]]
Plus, sometimes hearing about others'[n]interests can get you into them too.

[msg MSG_009 [Ann]]
I love musicals!
It may not have been a movie, but when I[n]saw one live on Broadway, I got[n]goosebumps!

[msg MSG_010 [Haru]]
I agree. When you hear a large group of[n]people's voices and see their movement[n]come together, it's so moving.

[msg MSG_011 [Hikari]]
See!? You get it! There are times even[n]in real life when your emotions grow so[n]strong that you feel like singing!
But I'm not much of a singer myself, so[n]I experience that through the characters[n]in the musicals.

[msg MSG_012 [Ann]]
Yeah! Sadness, happiness, and even anger[n]are expressed so vividly with song and[n]dance.

[msg MSG_013 [Hikari]]
Yeah. The actors express every kind of[n]emotion and mood with their bodies, to[n]all sorts of musical genres.
The musical's ability to directly[n]express human emotion is what really[n]appeals to me.
I can still remember when I found out[n]that dialogue isn't the only way to[n]communicate a message to an audience.

[msg MSG_014 [Yukiko]]
*giggle* You must really love musicals,[n]Hikari-chan.

[msg MSG_015 [Hikari]]
*gasp* I'm sorry! There I go, ranting[n]again...

[sel SEL_016 top]
It's pretty surprising, actually.
You're so passionate.
You're quite the enthusiast.

[msg MSG_017 [Ryuji]]
Right? I never thought you could get so[n]heated.
So, musicals let you express strong[n]emotions like that through singin' and[n]dancin', huh?

[msg MSG_018 [Makoto]]
She must love musicals because she's[n]that way deep down, and musicals often[n]directly express such emotion.

[msg MSG_019 [Futaba]]
Mweheheh... An enthusiast won't stop[n]once they get going on their topic. I'm[n]so happy to see Hikari this fired up!

[msg MSG_020 [Yukiko]]
I admit I'm a bit jealous that you have[n]something that you're so passionate[n]about...
I hope I can find something that[n]fascinates me the same way―you know,[n]like Chie with her kung fu and meat.

[msg MSG_021 [Chie]]
C'mon, I don't think meat counts! I[n]mean, I do love it and all, but,[n]still...
Ooh, but I AM fascinated with kung fu.[n]Do you wanna watch "Trial of the Dragon"[n]with me sometime, Yukiko?

[msg MSG_022 [Hikari]]
That's that famous kung fu movie! I've[n]seen it too―it even got my blood[n]boiling!

[msg MSG_023 [Chie]]
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about! I[n]get so pumped that I can't help but[n]yell, "Hwa-taaaa!" myself!
Man, you sure know your stuff,[n]Hikari-chan. To think you'd get what's[n]great about even that movie!

[msg MSG_024 [Hikari]]
U-Um... Does anyone else have a favorite[n]movie?

[sel SEL_025 top]
The Cake Knight Rises.
Love Possibly.
Mes Miserable.
I can't think of any.

[msg MSG_027 [Ann]]
I saw it too! I couldn't hold back the[n]waterworks for that one.

[msg MSG_028 [Morgana]]
Oh yeah, that was a musical too.
I felt like I learned about human[n]kindness due to that bishop's merciless[n]nature...

[msg MSG_029 [Morgana]]
Seriously? When we get back, let's go[n]watch something.

[msg MSG_030 [Makoto]]
I think "Like A Dragon" would be my[n]choice. It was pretty thrilling...

[msg MSG_031 [Hikari]]
That's the yakuza movie, right!? I can[n]remember getting a chill down my spine[n]from just how intense it was.

[msg MSG_032 [Makoto]]
You really do know your stuff, don't[n]you, Hikari-chan?
I'm surprised that you're acquainted[n]with so many different types of movies[n]and not just the musicals.

[msg MSG_033 [Teddie]]
Is there a reason you fell in love with[n]movies, Hikarin?

[msg MSG_034 [Hikari]]
Huh...? My reason?
My... reason...

[msg MSG_035 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hikari-chan?

[msg MSG_036 [Hikari]]
Hm? Oh... It's probably because I've[n]been watching movies ever since I can[n]remember.
But... I can't recall any more than that[n]right now...

[msg MSG_037 [Yukari]]
I see. Well, we might be able to learn[n]some more if we keep goin' through this[n]movie.

[msg MSG_038 [Hikari]]
Mmhm... I need to make sure to watch it[n]all. Let's keep going, everyone.

[msg MSG_039 [Morgana]]
Make sure everyone stays on guard.
This film may look all cheery, but don't[n]forget―it's crawling with Shadows!
