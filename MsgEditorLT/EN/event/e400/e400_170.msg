[msg MSG_000 [Yukari]]
Wh-What was that just now?

[msg MSG_001 [Akechi]]
Could that have been Hikari-san's[n]memory? That was far grimmer than the[n]trailer we watched...

[msg MSG_002 [Rise]]
Where'd that teacher and her students[n]go? Did the Hikari-chan from the past[n]disappear too?

[msg MSG_003 [Koromaru]]
Arf arf!

[msg MSG_004 [Hikari]]
Ah... That was...

[msg MSG_005 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hikari-chan!

[msg MSG_006 [Ann]]
Hikari! What a relief, you're okay!

[msg MSG_007 [Teddie]]
Are you hurt anywhere, Hikarin?

[msg MSG_008 [Hikari]]
No... I'm okay.

[msg MSG_009 [Mitsuru]]
Sorry to interrupt, but where did Doe[n]go? He kidnapped you and brought you[n]here, correct?

[msg MSG_010 [Hikari]]
Oh... Ah, that's not it...
I... I came here on my own.

[msg MSG_011 [Futaba]]
Wh-What!? Doe didn't do it?

[msg MSG_012 [Hikari]]
As I watched the movies that everyone[n]changed, I started to remember, little[n]by little...
All the things I'd given up on, and the[n]things I'd forgotten...
It all began welling up inside, and[n]after remembering those things...
...I felt like I needed to change, too.

[msg MSG_013 [Naoto]]
So you decided to enter the movie of[n]your own accord?

[msg MSG_014 [Hikari]]
...Doe told me to do it.
He said I can't stay part of the[n]audience forever... That I need to[n]overcome this...
When he told me that, my urge to come[n]here only got stronger... So...

[sel SEL_015 top]
Don't be so reckless next time.
Are you sure you're not hurt?
We're just glad you're okay.

[msg MSG_016 [Hikari]]
I'm sorry... But I felt like I had to[n]come here, no matter what...

[msg MSG_017 [Yukiko]]
Are you hurt anywhere? Did you get[n]attacked at all while you've been here?

[msg MSG_018 [Hikari]]
No, I've been fine―but I'm not sure[n]why...

[msg MSG_019 [Hikari]]
Mmhm, I haven't been in any danger since[n]I got here...

[msg MSG_020 [Hikari]]
Ah... Thankfully, I haven't run into any[n]danger since I got here...

[msg MSG_021 [Yukiko]]
I see. Well, I'm just relieved that you[n]weren't hurt.

[msg MSG_022 [Futaba]]
Oh, I'm just so glad you're all right,[n]Hikari... I feel like that shaved more[n]than a few years off my life!

[msg MSG_023 [Hikari]]
Futaba-chan, I'm sorry I worried you...[n]And everyone else, too.

[msg MSG_024 [P4 Hero]]
So, about that musical we saw―could that[n]have been your...?

[msg MSG_025 [Hikari]]
Mmhm... The story was based on my own[n]memories.
It was told as a musical, but what[n]happened... it was almost exactly the[n]same as my past.

[msg MSG_026 [Yusuke]]
So, what we saw was indeed[n]biographical...

[msg MSG_027 [Ryuji]]
What the hell was up with that teach!?[n]That was worse than shitty―she shoulda[n]gotten canned for that!

[msg MSG_028 [Akechi]]
True, that was unforgivable―but at least[n]I feel as if the picture is coming[n]together now.

[msg MSG_029 [Naoto]]
Concepts like "hero" and "teacher"...[n]"Absolute authority" would be another.[n]The last keyword would be...

[sel SEL_030 top]
"Majority rule."
"Rabbit."
"Robot."

[msg MSG_031 [Akechi]]
That's from a different movie. The final[n]piece to that musical number's puzzle is[n]"rabbit."

[msg MSG_032 [Akechi]]
Precisely.

[msg MSG_033 [Ann]]
Wait... are you guys talking about[n]Kamoshidaman? And how he transformed[n]into a rabbit?

[msg MSG_034 [Futaba]]
Yep, nailed it. Kamoshidaman was made up[n]from Hikari's memories.

[msg MSG_035 [Yusuke]]
That elementary school teacher was the[n]"absolute authority" of her classroom.
This perfectly describes Kamoshidaman as[n]well. No one must have been able to defy[n]her, even when she was wrong.

[msg MSG_036 [Makoto]]
In the rabbit ordeal, Hikari-chan was[n]unfairly scolded by a teacher―someone[n]with absolute authority.
And the rabbit itself―the symbol of[n]Hikari-chan's trauma―appeared in the[n]movie as well...

[msg MSG_037 [Hikari]]
......

[msg MSG_038 [Ann]]
Now that I think back, those citizens[n]that followed Kamoshidaman... They[n]must've been the students who didn't―
No, who couldn't speak up to the teacher[n]due to her authority.

[msg MSG_039 [Ryuji]]
A shitty-ass movie born from shitty-ass[n]memories, huh? No wonder it was so[n]effin' disgusting.

[msg MSG_040 [Haru]]
This is just a thought, but this logic[n]applies to more films besides[n]Kamoshidaman, doesn't it?

[msg MSG_041 [Makoto]]
You're right... The same could be said[n]about A.I.G.I.S. or Junessic Land...
I think they've all been connected to[n]Hikari-chan's memories, in some shape or[n]form.

[msg MSG_042 [Shinjiro]]
That means this movie with the[n]unreadable title's also related to her[n]memories.

[msg MSG_043 [Akihiko]]
Hm... I feel like we're slowly starting[n]to see what's driving this movie world.

[msg MSG_044 [Naoto]]
What I'm more curious about is, why was[n]this world born to begin with?
An individual having a painful past[n]doesn't solely explain the reason behind[n]this entire tangible world.

[msg MSG_045 [Mitsuru]]
Hikari, is there anything that comes to[n]mind on your part?

[msg MSG_046 [Hikari]]
I'm sorry. I can't think of anything...

[msg MSG_047 [Morgana]]
Hm, a world that reflects a person's[n]heart... That sounds like something we[n]have some experience with.

[sel SEL_048 top]
What do you mean?
The cognitive world...

[msg MSG_049 [Morgana]]
Oh, come on! I'm talking about the[n]cognitive world! Did you really forget[n]all about it!?
Well, we can't use the Metaverse[n]Navigator here, so this doesn't seem to[n]be the exact same thing...

[msg MSG_050 [Morgana]]
Right. But we can't use the Metaverse[n]Navigator here, so this doesn't seem to[n]be the exact same thing...

[msg MSG_051 [Yosuke]]
I'm not totally sure why, but this place[n]feels pretty similar to the TV world our[n]team deals with.

[msg MSG_052 [Kanji]]
Oh yeah―now that you mention it, it does[n]kinda feel the same.

[msg MSG_053 [Yukiko]]
So, in essence, the movies have all been[n]based on Hikari-chan's emotionally[n]traumatizing experiences, right?
Then we need to reconsider Doe's goal―[n]although, he's still a complete mystery[n]to us...

[msg MSG_054 [Yukari]]
Doe said to Hikari-chan, "You need to[n]overcome this," right?
Considering that, it's starting to feel[n]like he's not really the bad guy after[n]all...

[msg MSG_055 [Hikari]]
......

[msg MSG_056 [Junpei]]
Whoa, are you okay, Hikari-chan? Feelin'[n]under the weather?

[msg MSG_057 [Hikari]]
I-It's not that. I just... I keep[n]thinking about why I'm always like[n]this...
It's my problem, so I should be the one[n]to solve it...
But in the end, I just caused so much[n]trouble for everyone... If that's the[n]case, then maybe I should just...

[sel SEL_058 top]
You're worrying too much.
That's not how we see things.
Don't be so hard on yourself.

[msg MSG_059 [Yosuke]]
Yeah, what he said. None of us here care[n]about that kinda thing.

[msg MSG_060 [P3 Hero]]
The thought of you being trouble to us[n]never even crossed our minds. We all[n]came here because we wanted to help.
I hope you can really believe us when we[n]say we feel that way about you.

[msg MSG_061 [Morgana]]
Right, the Phantom Thieves are meant to[n]save people in trouble.

[msg MSG_062 [P3 Hero]]
We members of SEES came here because we[n]wanted to rescue you―the same goes for[n]the Investigation Team, too.
I hope you can really believe us when we[n]say we feel that way about you.

[msg MSG_063 [Akihiko]]
Yeah, there's no need to beat yourself[n]up over this. Nobody here minds pitching[n]in.

[msg MSG_064 [P3 Hero]]
The thought of you being trouble to us[n]never even crossed our minds. We all[n]came here because we wanted to help.
I hope you can really believe us when we[n]say we feel that way about you.

[msg MSG_065 [Hikari]]
Everyone...

[msg MSG_066 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Plus, we've only made it this far by[n]working together―don't you think we[n]should see this through as a team too?

[msg MSG_067 [Haru]]
We can all truly tell that you want to[n]change, Hikari-chan...
That's why I want to lend my strength to[n]you.

[msg MSG_068 [Hikari]]
Thank you so much...
If it's not too much of a―No... Would[n]you all please lend me your strength[n]here?
In order for me to change, and for all[n]of us to get out of this place―I want to[n]see this movie to the end!

[msg MSG_069 [Teddie]]
Totally and for sure! Everyone feels the[n]same way―don't you, Yosuke?

[msg MSG_070 [Yosuke]]
What're you asking me for, moron? I'm[n]not everyone! But, of course I'm in!

[msg MSG_071 [Mitsuru]]
Hm, you're all such reliable people...
Escaping this world is still important,[n]but we've come this far―we'll see this[n]through together, to the very end.

[msg MSG_072 [Ryuji]]
Welp, it's decided! Let's get deep in[n]this movie and change the shit out of[n]it!
