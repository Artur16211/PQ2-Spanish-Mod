[msg MSG_000 [Yukari]]
...Hey, Hikari-chan. You like movies,[n]right?

[msg MSG_001 [Hikari]]
Yeah, I love them. Why?

[msg MSG_002 [Yukari]]
Well, I was wondering why you were[n]trapped in a movie theater in the first[n]place.

[msg MSG_003 [Teddie]]
Hrmmm... If Doe is the one who's[n]imprisoned Hikarin, then maybe he's[n]suited her cage to her liking?

[sel SEL_004 top]
How nice of him.
It's more about what Doe likes.
He's a courteous host.

[msg MSG_005 [Junpei]]
Uh, if he's so nice, why'd he even trap[n]her here!?

[msg MSG_006 [Yosuke]]
Yeah. No matter how much she loves[n]movies, trapping her and forcing her to[n]watch these awful ones makes no sense.

[msg MSG_007 [Ann]]
Oh, right. Since Doe's a projectionist,[n]it's not hard to imagine he'd choose a[n]place that suits his own interests too.

[msg MSG_008 [Yusuke]]
I see. If he's having her stay for a[n]long time, he may as well make it[n]comfortable for her.

[msg MSG_009 [Yosuke]]
Dude, he trapped her here! What kinda[n]host is that!?

[msg MSG_010 [Yusuke]]
I'd have no issue being trapped in[n]Joker's residence, though...
It's a comfortable spot, and there's[n]curry there. If I had art supplies with[n]me, I could spend weeks at his place.

[msg MSG_011 [Yosuke]]
I just got hit with the strongest sense[n]of deja vu, like I've got my own bear to[n]cross...

[msg MSG_012 [Hikari]]
Um... To be honest, I kind of liked that[n]movie theater at first...
I got to watch movies for as long as I[n]wanted.

[msg MSG_013 [Ann]]
Really? But, wasn't it just the same[n]movie on loop until we showed up?
Plus, it was that awful Kamoshidaman[n]flick... I know you love movies and all,[n]but wouldn't that get old?

[msg MSG_014 [Hikari]]
It was repetitive, but I didn't mind...[n]Actually, nothing bothered me at all[n]while I was watching...

[msg MSG_015 [Yukiko]]
I know what you mean.
There have been times where I didn't[n]want to think about anything and just[n]run away from it all.

[msg MSG_016 [Hikari]]
Mmhm... I think I was trying to escape[n]reality in that movie theater.
But, I can definitely say that's not the[n]case anymore. Those aren't the kinds of[n]movies that I want to watch now.

[msg MSG_017 [Naoto]]
Not having to think as long as you were[n]watching the movie... It's almost as if[n]you were locking yourself away instead.

[msg MSG_018 [Ken]]
Huh? What do you mean?

[msg MSG_019 [Naoto]]
When she first arrived, Hikari-san had[n]no intentions of leaving the movie[n]theater...
But, as she watched the films, both the[n]plots of the movies and her own feelings[n]began to change―and Doe spit up keys.

[msg MSG_020 [Akechi]]
It's as if his actions were linked to[n]Hikari-san's changes of heart and her[n]desire to leave this place.

[msg MSG_021 [Hikari]]
My heart was related to all this...?

[msg MSG_022 [Naoto]]
When she first arrived, Hikari-san had[n]no intentions of leaving the movie[n]theater...
But, as she watched the films, both the[n]plots of the movies and her own feelings[n]began to change...
We can't be certain of anything yet, but[n]there must be some connection between[n]the theater and Hikari-san.

[sel SEL_023 top]
Doe.
Nagi.
The Blue Brigade.

[msg MSG_024 [Ryuji]]
Yep, makes sense to me.

[msg MSG_025 [Mitsuru]]
That's a good point―Doe has been serving[n]as the projectionist this whole time...
Still, something seems off to me.

[msg MSG_026 [Chie]]
Wha―Are you serious!?

[msg MSG_027 [Kanji]]
Uhh... Didn't Nagi-san wake up here in[n]the theater with Hikari, though?
Doesn't that mean she just got dragged[n]into this whole mess like we did?

[msg MSG_028 [Ryuji]]
When it comes down to it, ain't Doe the[n]only one who could pull off somethin'[n]this ridiculous?

[msg MSG_029 [Mitsuru]]
That's a good point―Doe has been serving[n]as the projectionist this whole time...
Still, something seems off to me.

[msg MSG_030 [Makoto]]
Hmm... Those people in all the blue[n]could very well know something, but...

[msg MSG_031 [Ryuji]]
Aw, c'mon―there's someone way more[n]effin' suspicious than them.

[msg MSG_032 [Mitsuru]]
You mean Doe... He has indeed been[n]serving as the projectionist this whole[n]time...
Still, something seems off to me.

[msg MSG_033 [Akechi]]
I must say, I agree...
However, we have no idea what Doe's[n]motives are, so nothing can be said for[n]certain at the moment.

[msg MSG_034 [Akihiko]]
I guess all we can do is find him and[n]press him for answers―who knows if[n]that'll actually do us any good...
Hikari and Doe both went into this[n]movie, right? There has to be a reason[n]why he's finally made a move.

[msg MSG_035 [Shinjiro]]
Aki's got a point. So, where in the hell[n]is he?

[msg MSG_036 [Hikari]]
I think he's at the end of this movie...[n]in the deepest point.

[msg MSG_037 [P4 Hero]]
You can tell where he is?

[msg MSG_038 [Hikari]]
It's just a feeling I'm getting... Sorry[n]I can't be more certain.

[msg MSG_039 [Naoto]]
Not at all―this place is most likely[n]intimately connected to your heart...
So, following it should be the fastest[n]way to resolving our predicament.

[msg MSG_040 [P3 Hero]]
Right. We'll follow you down the path[n]that you believe in.
C'mon, let's keep going.
