Normal people don't act like that.

You're not normal... You're obviously[n]erroneous.

[msg MSG_MOVIE_003]
I don't get it, I don't get it... I'm[n]just me.

Why do you have to be like that?

[msg MSG_MOVIE_005]
You're not normal.

[msg MSG_MOVIE_006]
Fitting in with everyone else... That is[n]what matters.

But, I have my own dream...

[msg MSG_MOVIE_008]
You'll just have to dispose of it so you[n]can fit in with everyone else.

Everyone is the same.

[msg MSG_MOVIE_012]
You don't need your self.

[msg MSG_MOVIE_013]
Cast off whoever you are!

[msg MSG_MOVIE_014]
But... But I...

[msg MSG_MOVIE_015]
