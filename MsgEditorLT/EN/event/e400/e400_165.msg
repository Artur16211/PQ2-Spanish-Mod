...Hikari, aren't you going to play[n]superhero today?
That's the only thing you've wanted to[n]do until lately―you love superheroes...

[msg MSG_001 [Young girl]]
No... I think I'm done. I got bored[n]playing superhero.

[msg MSG_002 [Calm man's voice]]
I see... Are you sure you won't be bored[n]today?

[msg MSG_003 [Young girl]]
I'll be fine. Even if I'm by myself...[n]I'll just watch movies.

[msg MSG_004 [Calm man's voice]]
Ah! I see...
Then, why don't we go see a movie[n]together next Sunday?

[msg MSG_005 [Young girl]]
Really!? What about your work, though?

[msg MSG_006 [Calm man's voice]]
Oh, I'll work hard and make sure to[n]finish everything beforehand.

[msg MSG_007 [Young girl]]
But, then won't you be too tired?

[msg MSG_008 [Calm man's voice]]
Even if I come home tired, it'll be[n]fine― seeing you will perk me right up.
You're my hero, Hikari.

[msg MSG_009 [Young girl]]
*giggle* Yay!
And... um... I made up my mind!

[msg MSG_010 [Calm man's voice]]
Hm?

[msg MSG_011 [Young girl]]
When I grow up, I'm gonna make movies!
You love movies, right Dad? I love them[n]too...
That's why I'm gonna make tons of them[n]for you to watch.
When I finish one, come see it, okay?[n]Promise me?

[msg MSG_012 [Calm man's voice]]
Well, that's something I really look[n]forward to.
I wonder what kind of movie you'll[n]make... I can't wait to see it.
