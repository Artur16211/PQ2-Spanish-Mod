[msg MSG_000 [Ann]]
We really CAN use our Personas here!

[msg MSG_001 [Haru]]
Since we're still in phantom thief[n]attire, does that mean this place is[n]still inside Mementos?

[msg MSG_002 [Yusuke]]
Except, we couldn't use our guns.

[msg MSG_003 [Akechi]]
Right, they turned into ordinary model[n]guns.

[msg MSG_004 [Ryuji]]
For real? Maybe it's just yours―

[msg MSG_005 [Ryuji]]
Wait, what―mine too!?
So we can use our Personas, but not our[n]guns? What the hell's up with this[n]place?

[sel SEL_006 top]
There's no cognitive effect here?
We're still in Mementos.
I'm not sure...

[msg MSG_007 [Makoto]]
That appears to be the case―but if so,[n]where exactly have we gone?

[msg MSG_008 [Makoto]]
But, since our guns don't work, doesn't[n]that mean we're not somewhere in[n]Mementos?
Could this place possibly be unaffected[n]by cognition?

[msg MSG_009 [Futaba]]
Hey―I'm sensing another Shadow! It's[n]headed this way!

[msg MSG_010 [Ryuji]]
There are more here!?

[msg MSG_011 [Futaba]]
That's not all―this one's a lot[n]different from those scrubs... It seems[n]way more dangerous.

[msg MSG_012 [Ann]]
What the―What's going on here!?

[msg MSG_013 [Futaba]]
I dunno, but we should avoid contact[n]with it.
I'll navigate―here, head in the[n]direction where there aren't any[n]Shadows!
