[msg MSG_000 [Ryuji]]
Ugh, now it's even MORE cramped in here,[n]thanks to the new guy...

[msg MSG_001 [Akechi]]
I'm sorry, but if I'd followed you all[n]on foot, I wouldn't have been able to[n]keep up.

[msg MSG_002 [Ann]]
To be totally honest, I'm pretty sure[n]we're way over max capacity...

[msg MSG_003 [Haru]]
Mona-chan, are you okay?

[msg MSG_004 [Morgana]]
Who do you think you're talkin' to here?[n]Just relax and leave it to―

[msg MSG_005 [Morgana]]
Mrowgh!?

[msg MSG_006 [Makoto]]
Huh―what was that!?

[msg MSG_007 [Morgana]]
Meow-ow-ow...

[msg MSG_008 [Ryuji]]
Whoa, Queen, what's the deal? Tryin' out[n]some Wild Max-style driving!?

[msg MSG_009 [Makoto]]
It's not me―the wheel's moving by[n]itself! What's happening?

[msg MSG_010 [Haru]]
Is all of our weight causing a problem?

[msg MSG_011 [Futaba]]
I don't think that would cause THIS...

[msg MSG_012 [Yusuke]]
Perhaps he ate something off the ground.

[msg MSG_013 [Morgana]]
I-I-I've never!

[msg MSG_014 [Morgana]]
Oh no... I-I've lost all control!

[msg MSG_015 [Ann]]
Whaaaat!?

[msg MSG_016 [Ryuji]]
Whaaaat!?

[msg MSG_017 [Yusuke]]
Whaaaat!?

[msg MSG_018 [Makoto]]
Whaaaat!?

[msg MSG_019 [Haru]]
Whaaaat!?

[msg MSG_020 [Futaba]]
Whaaaat!?

[msg MSG_021 [Akechi]]
Whaaaat!?
