Another brilliant victory, Joker!

[msg MSG_001 [Akechi]]
Mementos...
So, this place was formed by society's[n]collective unconscious? That makes it[n]the entire population's Palace...
This seems to be another, different form[n]of the cognitive world.

[msg MSG_002 [Yusuke]]
Who knows what lies within its depths?[n]It strikes at the heart of my[n]intellectual curiosity.

[msg MSG_003 [Haru]]
On the other hand, it's pretty[n]frightening as well...

[msg MSG_004 [Ann]]
I still remember hating this place when[n]we first started coming here.

[msg MSG_005 [Futaba]]
If we keep dallying like this, we're[n]gonna end up meeting some mobs. Mona,[n]you oughta transform.

[msg MSG_006 [Morgana]]
......

[msg MSG_007 [Futaba]]
Monaaa?

[msg MSG_008 [Haru]]
What's the matter, Mona-chan?

[msg MSG_009 [Morgana]]
Oh! Sorry. It's just that Mementos[n]feels... different than usual.

[msg MSG_010 [Makoto]]
Different how?

[msg MSG_011 [Ryuji]]
...Ain't this what it's always like?[n]Hey, Joker, what do you think?

[sel SEL_012 top]
Same Mementos as always.
It does seem different.
No clue.

[msg MSG_013 [Ann]]
I think so, too.

[msg MSG_014 [Yusuke]]
Oh? It seems I lack the training[n]necessary to sense it.

[msg MSG_015 [Ann]]
It feels the same as always to me...

[msg MSG_016 [Yusuke]]
I, too, have no idea.

[msg MSG_017 [Morgana]]
Hmm... guess it's just my imagination.
Anyways, it's transformation time! Back[n]up, everyone!

[msg MSG_018 [Akechi]]
I can't believe this cat turns into a[n]car... What a fascinating world this is.
