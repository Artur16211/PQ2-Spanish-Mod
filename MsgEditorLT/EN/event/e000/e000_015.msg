...ey.
...eey, get up!

[msg MSG_002 [Morgana]]
Geez, you're finally awake. Class has[n]been over for a while now...

[sel SEL_003 top]
I'm not in a theater anymore?
That butterfly...

[msg MSG_004 [Morgana]]
Are you still half-asleep or something?

[msg MSG_005 [Morgana]]
Butterfly? What are you talking about?

[msg MSG_006]
My head feels like it's spinning...

[msg MSG_007 [Morgana]]
Hey, are you sure you're feeling okay?[n]Did you have some kind of weird dream?

[msg MSG_008]
Shujin High, Classroom 2-D...
I guess I fell asleep...

[msg MSG_009 [Morgana]]
Well, now that you're up, let's get back[n]home―we need to figure out our plans for[n]the rest of the day!

[sel SEL_010 top]
Fine, fine.
I'm still sleepy...

[msg MSG_011 [Morgana]]
The whole day's gonna blow by if we keep[n]fooling around here. You need to make[n]better use of your time!

[msg MSG_012 [Morgana]]
Then again, an awful lot's been going on[n]lately―maybe all that hard work's[n]finally catching up to you...
I've got your back, so just hang in[n]there, all right?

[msg MSG_013 [Morgana]]
Now, let's get out of here!
