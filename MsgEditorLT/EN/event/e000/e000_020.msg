[msg MSG_000 [Ryuji]]
Hell yeah, another day of class[n]complete! Man, was that hellish!

[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
*yawn* So sleepy...

[msg MSG_002 [Morgana]]
C'mon Ryuji, pull yourself together![n]Don't get all lazy on us now.

[msg MSG_003 [Ryuji]]
Nah, I've just had a hard time fallin'[n]asleep latelyâ€•Phantom Thieves stuff on[n]my mind, an' all...
It's getting so bad, I slept through[n]most of class today...

[msg MSG_004 [Morgana]]
Isn't that what you do every day?

[msg MSG_005 [Ryuji]]
Shut up! So, what're we doin' now?
Our time limit's still a ways off, but[n]who cares? Let's all meet up at the[n]hideout anyway!

[sel SEL_006 top]
That's the plan.
And do what, exactly?
I want to grab some ramen first.

[msg MSG_007 [Ryuji]]
That's what I'm talkin' about! Always[n]straight to the point.

[msg MSG_008 [Ryuji]]
Eh, we can figure that out once we're[n]all there.

[msg MSG_009 [Morgana]]
Sounds good to me.

[msg MSG_010 [Ryuji]]
Oh, too cool for the gang, huh? ...Then[n]again, I could go for a bowl myself.

[msg MSG_011 [Morgana]]
Hey, it's too early for dinner! We[n]should meet up at the hideout.

[msg MSG_012 [Haru]]
Oh, hello everyone.

[msg MSG_013 [Ryuji]]
Ooh, perfect timing! We were just[n]talkin' about heading to the hideout.

[msg MSG_014 [Haru]]
Well, I'm free for the rest of the day.[n]I have more free time now that things[n]have settled down in the company.

[msg MSG_015 [Morgana]]
Ryuji, send the word out to everyone.

[msg MSG_016 [Ryuji]]
Okay!

[msg MSG_017 [Ryuji]]
"Let's all meet up at the hideout..."

[msg MSG_018 [Ryuji]]
Damn, that was fast!

[msg MSG_018_5 [Ryuji]]
Everyone says they're down to meet at[n]Leblanc.

[msg MSG_019 [Haru]]
Shall we, then?
