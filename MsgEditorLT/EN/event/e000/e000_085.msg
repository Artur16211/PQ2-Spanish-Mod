[msg MSG_000 [Makoto]]
Hey everyone, look at the Meta-Nav. It's[n]not working... Something's wrong here.

[msg MSG_001 [Morgana]]
Everyone's got the same error screen...[n]So, everyone's app is bugged out at the[n]same time?

[msg MSG_002 [Akechi]]
No, that seems highly unlikely. We need[n]to gather more information.

[msg MSG_003 [Haru]]
Maybe we can find a clue to this if we[n]look around the area...

[msg MSG_004 [Ryuji]]
Crap―a cop!

[msg MSG_005 [Ann]]
Wait a sec, look at his uniform! That's[n]not for Japan's police.

[msg MSG_006 [Futaba]]
Looks like some foreign cop's uniform―[n]it reminds me of the ones I've seen in[n]FPSes.
Hmm... seems like he's not a Shadow,[n]either.

[msg MSG_007 [Makoto]]
Then, maybe we should... try to ask him[n]where we are?

[msg MSG_008 [Ryuji]]
Wha―Talk to a cop!? In these clothes?

[sel SEL_009 top]
Good luck, Queen.
We'll manage somehow.

[msg MSG_010 [Makoto]]
Huh? Me!?

[msg MSG_011 [Futaba]]
If you end up aggroing him, just[n]threaten him with your spikes, Queen!

[msg MSG_012 [Makoto]]
*sigh* Fine―I suppose it was my idea in[n]the first place...

[msg MSG_013 [Ann]]
Yeah, I suppose standing around and just[n]talking about it isn't getting us[n]anywhere...
Well, we're counting on you, Queen!

[msg MSG_014 [Makoto]]
Huh? Me!?

[msg MSG_015 [Futaba]]
Mweheheh―if you plot to do it, you got[n]to do it!

[msg MSG_016 [Makoto]]
All right, I'll give it a try. But if[n]something goes wrong, I need you all to[n]back me up...

[msg MSG_017 [Makoto]]
Um, excuse me...

[msg MSG_018 [Serious policeman]]
Hmm―whoa there, what's with the getup?

[msg MSG_019 [Ryuji]]
I toldja so...
Especially with Queen doing it. She[n]looks like she just stepped out of Wild[n]Max.

[msg MSG_020 [Makoto]]
Ah... We're headed to a costume party,[n]but we've gotten ourselves lost.

[msg MSG_021 [Morgana]]
Ugh, such a clich〒 answer!

[msg MSG_022 [Futaba]]
That's what makes it perfect!

[msg MSG_023 [Serious policeman]]
A party, eh? Those are some pretty[n]elaborate costumes...

[msg MSG_024 [Futaba]]
Ooh, he actually bought it! That was[n]easier than we expected.

[msg MSG_025 [Yusuke]]
Perhaps our ostentatious styles helped[n]to bolster our credibility.

[msg MSG_026 [Serious policeman]]
So, what's the problem?

[msg MSG_027 [Makoto]]
If it's not too much trouble, could you[n]tell us where we are right now?

[msg MSG_028 [Serious policeman]]
This is the 1st Ward of Kamo City― don't[n]you know anything about the megalopolis?

[msg MSG_029 [Ryuji]]
Ugh, what a crappy name. Ever heard of[n]it, Joker?

[sel SEL_030 top]
Yeah, I've heard of it.
I haven't got a clue.

[msg MSG_031 [Ryuji]]
Huh? For real!?

[msg MSG_032 [Haru]]
Well, it doesn't ring a bell for me...[n]Maybe it's a new theme park or[n]something?

[msg MSG_033 [Ryuji]]
Yeah, me neither. I'd never forget a[n]name like that if I heard it before.

[msg MSG_034 [Haru]]
Hmm... Maybe it's a new theme park or[n]something?

[msg MSG_035 [Serious policeman]]
You're all acting awfully suspicious―[n]where did you say you came from?

[sel SEL_036 top]
Oh, from thataway.
We got here through Mementos.
Um, we can't remember.

[msg MSG_037 [Serious policeman]]
And which way is that!?

[msg MSG_038 [Serious policeman]]
Memen―What?

[msg MSG_039 [Serious policeman]]
Wha―But you can remember that you're[n]headed to a costume party!?

[msg MSG_040 [Ann]]
He's not buying it!

[msg MSG_041 [Akechi]]
Hmm. This is not going well...

[msg MSG_042 [Serious policeman]]
You're all pretty shady―let's hear what[n]you've been up to around here, and don't[n]feed me any more lines!

[msg MSG_043 [Makoto]]
Ah, wait, please! We really are―

[msg MSG_044 [Morgana]]
Oh no―backup!? And tons of it!

[msg MSG_045 [Serious policeman]]
Those masked individuals are behaving[n]suspiciously. Arrest them immediately!

[msg MSG_046 [Fat policeman]]
Roger that―we'll take the charge!

[msg MSG_047 [Ryuji]]
Oh, shit! Kick the bricks!

[msg MSG_048 [Makoto]]
S-Sorry!

[msg MSG_049 [Serious policeman]]
Go! Don't let 'em get away!
