[msg MSG_000 [Ryuji]]
So, what's the plan for today? We still[n]got time until the next time limit.

[msg MSG_001 [Morgana]]
One thing we could do is try to beef up[n]in Mementos.
But, let's decide after Lady Ann[n]arrives. She texted us that she's almost[n]here...

[msg MSG_002 [Ann]]
So sorry I'm late! The photoshoot went[n]on longer than expected.

[msg MSG_003 [Futaba]]
Ohhh, speak of the devil.

[msg MSG_004 [Makoto]]
Hm? What's that flier for?

[msg MSG_005 [Ann]]
Oh, this? Someone gave it to me while I[n]was on set.

[msg MSG_006 [Ryuji]]
A high-school student film festival?

[msg MSG_007 [Morgana]]
What's that?

[msg MSG_008 [Haru]]
Well, it's an event where high-schoolers[n]make their own movies, screen them, and[n]have them judged... I think?

[msg MSG_009 [Yusuke]]
I send my paintings to art exhibitions,[n]so it makes sense for there to be a film[n]equivalent of that.

[msg MSG_010 [Ann]]
I didn't even know that high-schoolers[n]could make a movie.

[msg MSG_011 [Makoto]]
Scriptwriting, stage direction,[n]filming... To think, kids our age are[n]doing all that.

[msg MSG_012 [Ryuji]]
......

[msg MSG_013 [Futaba]]
Hey, Ryuji got all quiet for some[n]reason. Did this festival blow your mind[n]or something? Hmm?

[msg MSG_014 [Ryuji]]
Nah, I just thought it sounds cool...[n]Hey, why don't we check it out?

[msg MSG_015 [Yusuke]]
Oh? It's rare to hear such language from[n]you, Ryuji.

[msg MSG_016 [Morgana]]
Right? I bet it's going to rain[n]tomorrow.

[msg MSG_017 [Futaba]]
No―it'll be a full-blown typhoon.

[msg MSG_018 [Ryuji]]
Argh! The hell!? I'm into movies too,[n]okay!?

[msg MSG_018_5 [Ryuji]]
Plus, I dunno how to put it, but... I've[n]got this feelin' that we hafta go see[n]this...
Agh, dammit! What's wrong with me!?

[msg MSG_019 [Ann]]
Uh, no point asking us...

[msg MSG_020 [Futaba]]
Ryuji's tantrum aside, I'm actually[n]pretty curious too.
Talking about amateur cult movies gets[n]me pretty psyched.

[msg MSG_021 [Morgana]]
A movie, huh? I've seen a few with―they[n]were pretty interesting.

[msg MSG_022 [Haru]]
Now I'm starting to feel like going to[n]this too. Hey, why don't we all go[n]together?

[msg MSG_023 [Makoto]]
That reminds me, we've never gone to see[n]one all together. This seems like a good[n]opportunity.
We've been progressing at a good pace[n]recently, so why don't we take a break[n]for today?

[msg MSG_024 [Yusuke]]
I agree. This could provide me with some[n]kind of artistic inspiration.

[msg MSG_025 [Futaba]]
I wanna watch a sci-fi movie!

[msg MSG_026 [Ryuji]]
Uh, there's no way a high-schooler could[n]make a sci-fi on their own!

[msg MSG_027 [Ann]]
So, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]―what's the plan for today?

[sel SEL_028 top]
Let's check out some movies.
Let's take a break together.

[msg MSG_029 [Ryuji]]
You heard the man!

[msg MSG_030 [Makoto]]
Okay, let's all go there together.

[msg MSG_031 [Morgana]]
Let's see―the location's printed here on[n]the flier.

[msg MSG_032 [Haru]]
*giggle* Let's take a breather and enjoy[n]some free time together.

[msg MSG_033 [Ryuji]]
C'mon, let's get ready, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]!
