[msg MSG_000 [P3 Hero]]
I'm back.

[msg MSG_001 [Yukari]]
Oh, there he is. Welcome home!

[msg MSG_002 [Koromaru]]
Arf!

[msg MSG_003 [Aigis]]
-san, what is that in your hand?

[msg MSG_004 [P3 Hero]]
Oh, this? I just rented a DVD.

[msg MSG_005 [Junpei]]
Could it be a sexy one? *squeal* What a[n]perv, [f 6 1 16 0 0]!

[msg MSG_006 [Yukari]]
Like that'd ever happen―he's not you,[n]Junpei.

[msg MSG_007 [P3 Hero]]
Yeah, it's just a normal movie. I'm not[n]sure why, but... I suddenly got the urge[n]to watch this one.

[msg MSG_008 [Ken]]
Oh, what did you rent?
I'm curious as to your taste in[n]movies,-san.

[msg MSG_009 [P3 Hero]]
If it sounds good to you, do you want to[n]watch it with me?

[msg MSG_010 [Fuuka]]
That sounds nice.
Everyone's home, so why don't we all[n]watch it in here together?

[msg MSG_011 [Mitsuru]]
Well... watching a movie in the[n]dormitory's shared space seems...

[msg MSG_012 [Akihiko]]
C'mon, don't be so uptight. It's[n]important to unwind from time to time.
Plus, I'm curious about this movie[n]suddenly wanted to watch too.

[msg MSG_013 [Yukari]]
Ah, then I'll grab the popcorn! I think[n]I've got some stocked up in my room...

[msg MSG_014 [Mitsuru]]
Popcorn?

[msg MSG_015 [Shinjiro]]
Ah, popcorn... Well, that's the routine[n]when it comes to watchin' movies.

[msg MSG_016 [Fuuka]]
That decides it! I'll go prepare some[n]drinks.

[msg MSG_017 [Ken]]
Ah, I'll help you.

[msg MSG_018 [Mitsuru]]
Movies, eh? Well, perhaps something of[n]the sort won't hurt―every once in a rare[n]while.

[msg MSG_019 [Aigis]]
That's what we're talkin' 'bout, Boss![n]You go, girl!

[msg MSG_020 [Mitsuru]]
...I've been wondering this for quite[n]some time now, but where in the world do[n]you learn such language?

[msg MSG_021 [Shinjiro]]
So, what movie's that, [f 6 1 16 0 0]?

[msg MSG_022 [Junpei]]
Ooh, is it sci-fi? I think I remember[n]this being super-popular a while back.

[msg MSG_023 [Yukari]]
Sorry for the wait! Popcorn's ready!
Also, we have cookies, and chocolate,[n]and gummies... Oh, and potato chips,[n]and...

[msg MSG_024 [Junpei]]
Wha―! Is there a grocery store in your[n]room!?

[msg MSG_025 [Fuuka]]
We've got the drinks!
Let's see, this one's coffee, and... Hm?[n]Was this one cola?

[msg MSG_026 [Koromaru]]
Arf, arf!

[msg MSG_027 [P3 Hero]]
Is everyone settled in? Then, I'm[n]starting it.
