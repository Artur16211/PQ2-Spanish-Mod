Whaâ€•!?

[msg MSG_001 [Hikari]]
Eek! I-I'm sorry!

[msg MSG_002 [Hikari's father]]
What's going on? You're usually not so[n]worked up.

[msg MSG_003 [Hikari]]
U-Um... I wanted talk to you, Dad.

[msg MSG_004 [Hikari's father]]
Did something good happen?

[msg MSG_005 [Hikari]]
Huh?

[msg MSG_006 [Hikari's father]]
Well, you're practically beaming.

[msg MSG_007 [Hikari]]
I don't really remember, but... I feel[n]like I had the most amazing dream.
It was fun, and exciting, but I also[n]feel like... it was a really significant[n]dream...

[msg MSG_008 [Hikari's father]]
I see... Sounds like it was a real[n]treat.
That's the same smile you get when you[n]watch a great movie. It's the smile I[n]love most.

[msg MSG_009 [Hikari]]
Movie...
Hey, Dad? I'm going to keep working on[n]that movie that I had been shooting.

[msg MSG_010 [Hikari's father]]
I thought you weren't going to shoot[n]movies ever again...
But, you've changed your mind. That's[n]great... Great.
I'll be your number one fan, Hikari.[n]You've been wanting to make one since[n]you were so young.

[msg MSG_011 [Hikari]]
Mmhm. I swear I'll finish it, so I hope[n]you'll look forward to watching it.
And, ah... There's a whole bunch more[n]that I want to tell you.
...Do you want to hear it?

[msg MSG_012 [Hikari's father]]
Hahaha... Well, you can tell me all[n]about it over a cup of coffee.

[msg MSG_013 [Hikari]]
Okay! So, to start off...
