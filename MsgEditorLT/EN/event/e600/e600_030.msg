Do you think everyone will like the food[n]I made?

[msg MSG_001 [P4 Hero]]
Of course they will.

[msg MSG_002 [Nanako]]
Mmhm!

[msg MSG_003 [Yosuke]]
Wassuuup! Heheh, are we on time?

[msg MSG_004 [Teddie]]
Nana-chaaan! Your Teddie has arrived!

[msg MSG_005 [Chie]]
Hey, Teddie! Don't go glomping her!

[msg MSG_006 [Teddie]]
Gaaah! I haven't done anything... yet...

[msg MSG_007 [Nanako]]
Oh, you're here too, Yukiko!

[msg MSG_008 [Yukiko]]
Hi, Nanako-chan. You seem like you're in[n]a good mood.

[msg MSG_009 [Nanako]]
*giggle* I was cooking with big bro!
I made sunny-side up eggs and rolled[n]omelettes!

[msg MSG_010 [P4 Hero]]
Welcome in, guys. Feel free to make[n]yourselves at home.

[msg MSG_011 [Kanji]]
Thanks! Don't mind if I do...

[msg MSG_012 [Chie]]
Anything good on TV?

[msg MSG_013 [Rise]]
Oh, it says there's gonna be a rerun of[n]a movie after this. I'm surprised it's[n]not just another soap opera.

[msg MSG_014 [Naoto]]
It looks like it'll be a dinosaur movie.

[msg MSG_015 [Nanako]]
Ooh, really!?
I love movies with dinosaurs!

[msg MSG_016 [Kanji]]
You like those kinda movies? That rules,[n]Nanako-chan!

[msg MSG_017 [Nanako]]
Um, I actually saw this one with Dad in[n]the movie theater!
The main dinosaur looks like Yosuke!

[msg MSG_018 [Yosuke]]
Wait, for real!? What kind of dinosaur[n]is that!?
Man, this is definitely the first time[n]I've been told I look like a dinosaur...

[msg MSG_019 [Yukiko]]
Heheh... A dinosaur that looks like[n]Yosuke-kun... Ahahahaha!

[msg MSG_020 [P4 Hero]]
Would you like to watch this movie with[n]us, Nanako?

[msg MSG_021 [Nanako]]
Can I!?

[msg MSG_022 [Teddie]]
If Nana-chan wishes it so, then none may[n]object!

[msg MSG_023 [P4 Hero]]
Well, the food's all ready. Can you guys[n]help me carry these dishes over?

[msg MSG_024 [Yosuke]]
Gotcha. You better not sneak any,[n]Teddie.

[msg MSG_025 [Teddie]]
*gulp* How did he know!?

[msg MSG_026 [Chie]]
Let's see, let's see, allow me to give[n]this here a little taste test...
Oooh! This is incredible, Nanako-chan!

[msg MSG_027 [Kanji]]
What're you sneakin' bites for,[n]Chie-senpai?

[msg MSG_028 [Nanako]]
Really!? It's good?

[msg MSG_029 [Teddie]]
You're as spectacular a cook as Sensei,[n]Nana-chan.

[msg MSG_030 [Yosuke]]
Seriously, I'm so glad you didn't take[n]after certain others we know...

[msg MSG_031 [P4 Hero]]
Yeah...

[msg MSG_032 [Rise]]
Heyâ€•did you just shoot us a look,[n]Senpai!?

[msg MSG_033 [Nanako]]
Oh! The movie's about to start!
