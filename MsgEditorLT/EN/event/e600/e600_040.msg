Huh? Was I sleeping?
Oh, right, I was studying. I guess I[n]ended up falling asleep...

[msg MSG_001 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I feel like I just had some dream,[n]but... Hm?

[msg MSG_002 [Yukari's voice]]
, you in there?

[msg MSG_003 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Oh, uh―yeah! What is it?

[msg MSG_004 [Yukari]]
Oh, you ARE here! Great!

[msg MSG_005 [Junpei]]
, did you zone out enough to drool on[n]yourself?
Hahaha, you're such a Space Detective!

[msg MSG_006 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Say what!?

[msg MSG_007 [Junpei]]
Just kidding!

[msg MSG_008 [Yukari]]
Are you stupid or something?
...Seriously, are you THAT stupid?

[msg MSG_009 [Junpei]]
Man, Yuka-tan, your riposte is as sharp[n]as ever!

[msg MSG_010 [Ken]]
Were you really napping in here? That's[n]kind of surprising.

[msg MSG_011 [Akihiko]]
Hey, what's the holdup?

[msg MSG_012 [Shinjiro]]
This guy wouldn't shut up about findin'[n]you... So we came to get you.

[msg MSG_013 [Fuuka]]
Everyone, our drinks are going to get[n]cold if we don't get back downstairs.

[msg MSG_014 [Mitsuru]]
Takeba, have you prepared the snacks?

[msg MSG_015 [Yukari]]
Oh yeah. You know it!
I've got cookies, chocolate, and a whole[n]bunch of popcorn.

[msg MSG_016 [Junpei]]
I never took you for the popcorn type,[n]Yuka-tan.

[msg MSG_017 [Yukari]]
Shut it. I get a craving sometimes―so[n]what!?

[msg MSG_018 [Aigis]]
It seems that we are all ready.

[msg MSG_019 [Koromaru]]
Bark!

[msg MSG_020 [P3 Fem Protag]]
......

[msg MSG_021 [Fuuka]]
-chan? What's wrong?

[msg MSG_022 [Shinjiro]]
You seem pretty out of it... You got a[n]fever or somethin'?

[msg MSG_023 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Oh no, it's just... I feel like I'm[n]finally home...

[msg MSG_024 [Aigis]]
Hm? Whatever do you mean?

[msg MSG_025 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Ahaha... I dunno.
But, I do wonder... I feel like I've[n]been wanting to see you guys for a long[n]time.

[msg MSG_026 [Yukari]]
Did you have a bad dream or something?

[msg MSG_027 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Umm, I don't think that's it...
Anyways―what's going on, everyone? Did[n]you need something?

[msg MSG_028 [Fuuka]]
Mmhm. We've all been talking about[n]watching a movie together downstairs...

[msg MSG_029 [Aigis]]
Our Boss has given us the greenlight to[n]do so. You go, girl!

[msg MSG_030 [Mitsuru]]
...I've been wondering this for quite[n]some time now, but where in the world do[n]you learn such language?

[msg MSG_031 [Ken]]
You'll watch it with us, won't you? It's[n]a sci-fi movie.

[msg MSG_032 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Watch a movie? A... sci-fi movie?

[msg MSG_033 [Yukari]]
Yep! C'mon, let's go!

[msg MSG_034 [P3 Fem Protag]]
...Sure!
