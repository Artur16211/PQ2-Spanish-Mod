Gaaaaaaah! How could I be defeated!?

[msg MSG_001 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Yessss!

[msg MSG_002 [Ryuji]]
Heh―serves you right!

[msg MSG_003 [Wavering man]]
Isn't justice... supposed to win?

[msg MSG_004 [Wavering woman]]
This is unbelievable...

[msg MSG_005 [Akechi]]
All that's left is for the citizens[n]blindly following him to come to their[n]senses.

[msg MSG_006 [Kamoshidaman]]
Guhhh...

[msg MSG_007 [Morgana]]
Kamoshidaman's down for the count!
Now's our chance to rescue Queen and[n]Noir!

[msg MSG_008 [Yusuke]]
Excellent―I'll go.

[msg MSG_009 [Akechi]]
I'll go too.

[msg MSG_010 [Kamoshidaman]]
I punish evil for everyone's sake! Don't[n]get in my way!

[msg MSG_011 [Ryuji]]
Ha, you got it all wrong...
Held under your thumb every day by your[n]selfish justice... That ain't peace OR[n]happiness!

[msg MSG_012 [Kamoshidaman]]
But... order is perfect with an absolute[n]ruler! Isn't that right!?

[msg MSG_013 [Ann]]
You may think you're doing this for the[n]right cause―but I think you're wrong.
Since you have all that power, you have[n]to make sure you use it properly!
Is everyone really so satisfied with[n]your justice? Take a look for yourself!

[msg MSG_014 [Wavering man]]
Hey, so... who's right in the end?

[msg MSG_015 [Wavering woman]]
Huh? How am I supposed to know?

[msg MSG_016 [Wavering man]]
All we did was what we were told...

[msg MSG_017 [Kamoshidaman]]
Grrr... Why!? Why won't you understand!?

[msg MSG_018 [Makoto]]
Thanks, guys! We're all right now.

[msg MSG_019 [Ryuji]]
Queen, you're safe! And you, Noir?

[msg MSG_020 [Haru]]
Mmhm, I'm okay too!

[msg MSG_021 [Morgana]]
Well then, Kamoshidaman: time to pay the[n]piper.
Drop all this foolishness and―

[msg MSG_022 [Kamoshidaman]]
Hraaaaaaaaaaaah!

[msg MSG_023 [Morgana]]
Whoa!?

[msg MSG_024 [Kamoshidaman]]
Justice doesn't lose! Justice...[n]always... WIIIINS!!!

[msg MSG_025 [Makoto]]
You're still going on about that?

[msg MSG_026 [Ryuji]]
You're bein' a real sore loser, man. No[n]one thinks you're a hero any―

[msg MSG_027 [Kamoshidaman]]
Hroooooaaaaaaaaaah...

[msg MSG_028 [Yusuke]]
What!?

[msg MSG_029 [Futaba]]
Be careful―something's happening!

[msg MSG_030 [Kamoshidaman]]
I didn't want to reveal this form... but[n]it's too late now!
