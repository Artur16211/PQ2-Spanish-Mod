[msg MSG_000 [Kamoshidaman]]
HAHAHA! Where'd your previous vigor go?

[msg MSG_001 [Yusuke]]
Ngh... I don't want to believe it, but[n]are we really unable to defy him!?

[msg MSG_002 [Ryuji]]
Ain't there anything we can do?

[msg MSG_003 [Haru]]
Oh no―if this keeps up...

[msg MSG_004 [Makoto]]
...Hey, Noir. Do you remember what that[n]policeman said earlier?
"As long as we still have 'that' around,[n]Kamoshidaman is invincible."

[msg MSG_005 [Haru]]
Oh, you're right!
So that means there's something making[n]Kamoshidaman untouchable?

[msg MSG_006 [Makoto]]
Did you notice how the eyes of the[n]statue shine when everyone becomes[n]immobile?

[msg MSG_007 [Haru]]
So, it's possible that they need to[n]target...

[msg MSG_008 [Makoto]]
Yes―the statue!

[msg MSG_009 [Kamoshidaman]]
HAHAHA! Of course you can't win against[n]me―I am absolutely just!

[msg MSG_010 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I don't think you're just at all!
You don't even listen to anyone else―[n]you only judge people by your own[n]standards!

[msg MSG_011 [Kamoshidaman]]
Ha! So it's true when they say that[n]losers have the biggest mouths!
Evildoers threatening society shall[n]perish: this is the law of Kamo City!

[msg MSG_012 [Makoto]]
Guys! That Kamoshidaman statue is the[n]reason you can't move!

[msg MSG_013 [Kamoshidaman]]
Wh-Wh-What!?

[msg MSG_014 [Ann]]
Huh? That butt-ugly statue?

[msg MSG_015 [Kamoshidaman]]
Wh-Wh-Wh-What're you talking about!?[n]Th-Th-The statue is wholly unrelated to[n]my power!

[msg MSG_016 [Futaba]]
He's really squirming there... Did they[n]nail it!?

[msg MSG_017 [Yusuke]]
So, we're to destroy that statue?

[msg MSG_018 [Ryuji]]
But, we can't move like we need to...
And it's way too far to target from[n]here. What should we do, Joker?

[sel SEL_019 top]
We have to retreat for now.
Do something about it.
Give it everything you've got!

[msg MSG_020 [Akechi]]
Mm, that's a wise decision. Let's[n]retreat so we can gain an advantage.

[msg MSG_021 [Ryuji]]
And what would that be!?

[msg MSG_022 [Akechi]]
I think we should retreat so we can gain[n]an advantage.

[msg MSG_023 [Ryuji]]
Alright, then! One, two―

[msg MSG_023_5 [Ryuji]]
―Wait, ain't that what we're already[n]effin' doing!?

[msg MSG_024 [Akechi]]
I think we should retreat so we can gain[n]an advantage.

[msg MSG_025 [Ryuji]]
Tch! I guess we got no other choice![n]But...

[msg MSG_026 [Haru]]
Everyone, go! We'll be fine!

[msg MSG_027 [Ann]]
Sorry―sit tight, we'll definitely be[n]back to rescue you!

[msg MSG_028 [Yusuke]]
We'll return soon!

[msg MSG_029 [Kamoshidaman]]
You think I'd let you scum merely flee?[n]Guards―seize the evildoers!

[msg MSG_030 [P3 Fem Protag]]
They're coming! What do we do!?

[msg MSG_031 [Ryuji]]
Ha, we're not gettin' caught by some[n]small fries!

[msg MSG_032 [Morgana]]
Right! The escape route's this way!

[msg MSG_033 [P3 Fem Protag]]
An escape route? Wow! That sounds like[n]real phantom thief business!

[msg MSG_034 [Yusuke]]
It's not LIKE it―we ARE the Phantom[n]Thieves.

[msg MSG_035 [Ann]]
Oh, save it―we've gotta run!

[msg MSG_036 [Kamoshidaman]]
So they got away... Well, no matter.

[msg MSG_037 [Kamoshidaman]]
Loyal citizens! The evil plaguing you[n]has fled, tails between their legs,[n]thanks to my absolute justice!

[msg MSG_038 [Agitated man]]
Woooah!

[msg MSG_039 [Brazen man]]
Now that's our Kamoshidaman!

[msg MSG_040 [Weary woman]]
Kamoshidaman was right after all!

[msg MSG_041 [Kamoshidaman]]
HAHAHAHAHA! Justice always wins!

[msg MSG_042 [Makoto]]
We have faith in you guys!
