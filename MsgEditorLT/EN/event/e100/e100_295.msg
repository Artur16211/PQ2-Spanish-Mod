[msg MSG_000 [Justine]]
Everyone seems to be present and[n]accounted for.

[msg MSG_001 [Yusuke]]
So, what is this Persona fusion you[n]speak of?

[msg MSG_002 [Caroline]]
Oh, you don't know about it, do you?

[msg MSG_003 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I do―Theo does it for me pretty often.

[msg MSG_004 [Caroline]]
What's this? A new face?

[msg MSG_005 [Justine]]
This feeling... Could it be...?
It's the same power of the wild card as[n]our prisoner's―the one we sensed when we[n]arrived...

[msg MSG_006 [Caroline]]
Impossible! Two with the power of the[n]wild card!?

[msg MSG_007 [Justine]]
It may not just be the two, either. For[n]all that we know, there could be...

[msg MSG_008 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Um... What's this about me?

[msg MSG_009 [Justine]]
...No, it's nothing. We were discussing[n]Persona fusions, yes?
Just as it sounds, this is the act of[n]merging together Personas.
These fused Personas will be reborn as a[n]new Persona.

[msg MSG_010 [Caroline]]
You can choose which Personas to fuse[n]yourself, or we can perform a[n]result-based fusion.
We will show you the Persona to be[n]formed, and all you must do is make your[n]selection from the list.

[msg MSG_011 [Ann]]
So, we can get new Personas, huh? Looks[n]like we're finally gaining an advantage[n]here.

[msg MSG_012 [Ryuji]]
If we keep doin' these fusions, can we[n]make super-strong ones?

[msg MSG_013 [Justine]]
No. To wield powerful Personas,[n]potential users must reach a level of[n]power befitting them.

[msg MSG_014 [Akechi]]
In other words, we'll need to train[n]ourselves as well.

[msg MSG_015 [Caroline]]
Differences in power may arise due to[n]your individual training regimens, but[n]there's no cause for concern...
The upper limit of a Persona's power[n]will be based on the strongest one[n]amongst you all.
At the same time, if you are all weak,[n]you will only be able to utilize weak[n]Personas.

[msg MSG_016 [Justine]]
Currently, only two Personas can be used[n]in your fusions...

[msg MSG_017 [Caroline]]
But, soon you will have access to[n]special fusions, wherein we fuse three[n]or more Personas.

[msg MSG_018 [Justine]]
Also, we will be accepting requests to[n]resummon any previously obtained[n]Personas.
However, every resummoning will come at[n]a price―"give and take" remains the law[n]of the land here.

[msg MSG_019 [Caroline]]
That concludes our list of offered[n]duties. Did you get all that?

[msg MSG_020 [Ryuji]]
Well, I definitely heard you, but it[n]sure doesn't feel like I get it...

[msg MSG_021 [Caroline]]
Then learn how it works firsthand. We're[n]ready at any time.

[msg MSG_022 [P3 Fem Protag]]
This is a bit different from the way I'm[n]used to doing it, but why don't we give[n]it a try?
Ah―that reminds me! I picked up this[n]shining film earlier when I was fighting[n]Shadows.

[msg MSG_023 [Ann]]
Oh, hey! That's what we need for taking[n]on new Sub-Personas!

[msg MSG_024 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Looks like there are already Personas on[n]this film―you can have them, if you[n]want.
