[msg MSG_000 [Futaba]]
Hmm, looks like the square you're[n]searching for is down the left path.

[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
Okay, so, what about the right one?

[msg MSG_002 [Futaba]]
That one's too dangerous―it's infested[n]with FOEs. Definitely don't go that way.

[msg MSG_003 [Ann]]
Seriously? Well, we better not go near[n]it.

[msg MSG_004 [Yusuke]]
Infested... Infested, hm? ...Infested.

[msg MSG_005 [Ryuji]]
Stop that! Are you castin' a spell or[n]something!?

[msg MSG_006 [Yusuke]]
Oh, I was merely curious as to why[n]they're gathered there. Could they be...[n]guarding something?

[msg MSG_007 [Ryuji]]
You think there might be treasure?

[msg MSG_008 [Morgana]]
I understand the curiosity, but rescuing[n]Queen and Noir comes first right now.

[msg MSG_009 [Akechi]]
He's right. If we go needlessly poking[n]around, who knows what unexpected―

[msg MSG_010 [Akechi]]
Quiet―someone's coming!

[msg MSG_011 [Serious policeman]]
We'd better set up flashier lighting for[n]the exhibition.

[msg MSG_012 [Fat policeman]]
Yeah, that'll really do a number for[n]Kamoshidaman's power and his control[n]over the city!

[msg MSG_013 [Serious policeman]]
For the sake of Kamo City's safety and[n]peace, we must have the best lighting[n]possible!

[msg MSG_014 [Yusuke]]
They seem to be discussing the[n]exhibition. It sounds like it'll be[n]quite the production...

[msg MSG_015 [P3 Fem Protag]]
What are they talking about?

[msg MSG_016 [Ann]]
It's that awful punishment exhibition...[n]They're planning to publicly execute our[n]friends.

[msg MSG_017 [Morgana]]
Looks like they haven't spotted us[n]yet... What should we do, Joker?

[sel SEL_018 top]
Let's get the jump on them.
Let's eavesdrop on them.

[msg MSG_019 [Ryuji]]
Oh yeah! Time to go wild!

[msg MSG_020 [Akechi]]
Wait a moment...
We may be able to pick up some clues[n]from them. Let's just see what happens[n]for a bit longer.

[msg MSG_021 [Ryuji]]
But...

[msg MSG_022 [Akechi]]
I agree with Joker. We might be able to[n]pick up some clues from them.

[msg MSG_023 [Serious policeman]]
Hey, so... Kamoshidaman IS doin' the[n]right thing here, yeah?

[msg MSG_024 [Fat policeman]]
Don't be stupid! Are you questioning his[n]judgment? You'd better watch what you[n]say...

[msg MSG_025 [Serious policeman]]
I mean, yeah, those criminals deserve[n]punishment, but do we really hafta make[n]a show out of it?

[msg MSG_026 [Fat policeman]]
It's thanks to those public executions[n]that we're able to maintain the peace!
Witnessing the punishment for evildoing[n]sets the citizens straight, which means[n]less work for us, right?

[msg MSG_027 [Serious policeman]]
Yeah, I guess so... If we get to live[n]peacefully, sacrificing criminals is a[n]cheap price to pay.

[msg MSG_028 [Fat policeman]]
All right, let's get to prepping the[n]lightwork so Kamoshidaman's show will be[n]a big success!

[msg MSG_029 [Akechi]]
Lightwork, huh...

[msg MSG_030 [Ann]]
Uh, what's the deal with that total[n]nonsense!?
Queen and Noir aren't even criminals!

[msg MSG_031 [Yusuke]]
Sacrifices can't be helped if they're[n]for justice, eh? I can't say I agree[n]with that argument...
Any form of justice built on sacrifice[n]will ring hollow.

[msg MSG_032 [Ryuji]]
Yeah, talk about a load of bullshit!

[msg MSG_033 [Morgana]]
At the very least, it's awfully[n]different from the justice that we[n]believe in.
So, let's keep pushing forward and prove[n]'em wrong!
