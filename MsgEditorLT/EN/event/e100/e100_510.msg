[msg MSG_000 [Kamoshidaman]]
Nngh... Wh-Why?

[msg MSG_001 [Doubtful man]]
Kamoshidaman told us he was absolute[n]justice...

[msg MSG_002 [Doubtful woman]]
Maybe... maybe he isn't actually justice[n]incarnate?

[msg MSG_003 [Disillusioned man]]
Either way... that was pretty satisfying[n]to watch.

[msg MSG_004 [Disillusioned woman]]
Are we not getting punished for saying[n]what we think anymore?

[msg MSG_005 [Futaba]]
None of them care about Kamoshidaman at[n]all.

[msg MSG_006 [Yusuke]]
Pitiful...

[msg MSG_007 [Kamoshidaman]]
Nngh... My justice... Ngh...
The city... doesn't need it?

[msg MSG_008 [Morgana]]
He was hellbent on defending his[n]righteousness to the end.

[msg MSG_009 [Ann]]
I wonder... Is it possible that he[n]really did think he was doing what was[n]best for the city?

[msg MSG_010 [Yusuke]]
A leader is needed to guide the masses―[n]but, the way he did it was nothing but a[n]dictatorship.

[msg MSG_011 [Ryuji]]
Yeah. Forcing people to obey you with[n]your power ain't gonna help anyone...
And executing innocent people just to[n]set an example is super messed up.

[msg MSG_012 [Morgana]]
Well, no matter what, this case is[n]solved. You do a bang-up job in this[n]world too, Joker.

[sel SEL_013 top]
That was a breeze.
That was a tough operation.
I really worked up an appetite.

[msg MSG_014 [P3 Fem Protag]]
No wonder you're the leader of the[n]Phantom Thieves!

[msg MSG_015 [Morgana]]
Dependable as always. Let's keep it up[n]so we can figure out how to get outta[n]here!

[msg MSG_016 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Still, you did great!

[msg MSG_017 [Morgana]]
Yeah! Justice always wins in the end!

[msg MSG_018 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Oh, me too, me too! I'm starving!

[msg MSG_019 [Morgana]]
Is food all you guys think about!?[n]Although, that was a pretty slick reply!

[msg MSG_020 [Haru]]
But, wow, you guys―your plan to steal[n]the Kamoshidaman statue was incredible!

[msg MSG_021 [Makoto]]
How did you do that?

[msg MSG_022 [Akechi]]
Ah yes―about that...

[msg MSG_023 [Morgana]]
First, we had Fox produce a cardboard[n]cutout that looked exactly like the real[n]statue.

[msg MSG_024 [Yusuke]]
I'd prefer to say that I painted a[n]counterfeit.

[msg MSG_025 [Morgana]]
Then, we snuck behind the real one and[n]tied balloons to it, so it would fly[n]away...

[msg MSG_026 [Ryuji]]
And we screwed with the lights to make[n]sure no one saw us.

[msg MSG_027 [Haru]]
But, how could you tell that it was even[n]light enough to fly off like that?

[msg MSG_028 [Ann]]
When we first fought Kamoshidaman, we[n]figured out that the statue was a phony.

[msg MSG_029 [Ryuji]]
That's why he freaked out so bad when it[n]flew away.

[msg MSG_030 [Makoto]]
I see... Well, it was quite the bold[n]idea.

[msg MSG_031 [Ryuji]]
Everyone was super psyched about it.[n]Especially [f 6 1 27 0 0 0]―right?

[msg MSG_032 [Haru]]
Um...

[msg MSG_033 [Morgana]]
Oh, we forgot to introduce her to you.[n]She's a Persona-user we met here in the[n]movie.

[msg MSG_034 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I'm [f 6 1 28 0 0 0]. Nice to meet you!

[msg MSG_035 [Makoto]]
She's... a Persona-user?

[msg MSG_036 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Mmhm―you two are too, right? I was[n]floored when I found out about you all.
We all think I might have come from[n]somewhere different than where you're[n]from, though...

[msg MSG_037 [Makoto]]
My mind is reeling from all of these[n]bizarre events...
I need some time to process this.

[msg MSG_038 [Ryuji]]
I gotcha. We've gotta figure out how to[n]escape the movie theater, anyways.

[msg MSG_039 [Haru]]
Movie theater?

[msg MSG_040 [Yusuke]]
A picture is worth a thousand words.[n]It'd be quicker to simply show you.

[msg MSG_041 [Ann]]
......

[msg MSG_042 [Ryuji]]
What's up, Panther?

[msg MSG_043 [Ann]]
Well... I was just wondering why[n]Kamoshidaman's true form was a rabbit.

[sel SEL_044 top]
He's a fan of rabbits.
He just wanted to be loved?
He was a sex fiend.

[msg MSG_045 [Ann]]
Really, that's why?

[msg MSG_046 [Ann]]
Oh, like how they say rabbits can die[n]from loneliness? Because, uh, that's not[n]how I would've described him...

[msg MSG_047 [Yusuke]]
I see... It is a well-known fact that[n]rabbits have strong sex drives.

[msg MSG_048 [Ann]]
Ugh. Don't even go there.

[msg MSG_049 [Akechi]]
I don't think we'll reach a conclusion[n]by standing around here. Let's return to[n]the movie theater.

[msg MSG_050 [Futaba]]
Yeah―everybody, get on back here!
