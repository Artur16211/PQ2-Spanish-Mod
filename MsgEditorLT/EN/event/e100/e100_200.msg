That's...

[msg MSG_001]
I bring news to the peace-loving[n]citizens of Kamo City...

[msg MSG_001_5]
I have captured the dastardly thieves[n]who threaten the harmony of our utopia!

[msg MSG_002]
Wooooooo! You're so awesome!

[msg MSG_003]
Kamoshidaman's our hero!

[msg MSG_004]
We love you, Kamoshidaman!

[msg MSG_005]
Queen... Noir!

[msg MSG_006]
However―there are yet more scoundrels[n]lurking in the shadows of Kamo City!

[msg MSG_006_4]
I shall fight for you all...

[msg MSG_006_7]
So, I ask that you cooperate with me in[n]the name of justice!

[msg MSG_007]
These rogues oppose our world's order―[n]they are most assuredly evildoers!

[msg MSG_007_5]
Thus, as enemies of justice, each one[n]shall be punished upon capture!

[msg MSG_008]
Huh!? Is this for effin' real!?

[msg MSG_009]
Let's begin with these two...

[msg MSG_009_5]
Come forth and witness their punishment[n]exhibition at Kamoshida Square!

[msg MSG_010]
What!?

[msg MSG_011]
Evil must always be punished...

[msg MSG_011_5]
Isn't that right, citizens of Kamo City?

[msg MSG_012]
Yeaaaaaah! Kamoshidamaaaan!

[msg MSG_013]
Punish those thieves!

[msg MSG_014]
Yeah! Punish 'em!
