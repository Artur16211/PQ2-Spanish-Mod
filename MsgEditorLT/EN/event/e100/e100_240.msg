[msg MSG_000 [Brown-haired girl]]
Whew, I'm saved... Thanks!

[msg MSG_000_5 [Brown-haired girl]]
Um, could you be... Persona-users too?

[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
Yeah―looks like the same goes for you.

[msg MSG_002 [Yusuke]]
To think there are additional Persona-[n]users here... I sense a mysterious fate[n]linking us.

[msg MSG_003 [Brown-haired girl]]
I was surprised too... You have such[n]elaborate masks on that I thought you[n]were more enemies at first!

[msg MSG_004 [Ann]]
Ahaha... Yeah, I guess these do look[n]pretty weird from other people's[n]perspectives...

[sel SEL_005 top]
They're not weird.
They're very stylish, actually.
We're not your enemy.

[msg MSG_006 [Brown-haired girl]]
Oh... Um, I'm sorry.

[msg MSG_006_5 [Brown-haired girl]]
I didn't mean it like they're not cool―[n]I think they have a lot of personality!

[msg MSG_007 [Brown-haired girl]]
Yeah, I agree. I think they're full of[n]personality.

[msg MSG_008 [Brown-haired girl]]
Yeah, I know―after all, you rescued me[n]once you saw I was in trouble!

[msg MSG_009 [Brown-haired girl]]
Oh yeah! So, about something you said a[n]moment ago―you know Theo!?

[msg MSG_010 [Akechi]]
That's right―although, we've only met[n]him quite recently, so we don't know him[n]well, per se.

[msg MSG_011 [Brown-haired girl]]
I see... I'm glad Theo's safe. We[n]suddenly got separated, so I'd grown[n]worried about him.

[msg MSG_012 [Akechi]]
Likewise, he seemed worried about you. I[n]hope you'll be reunited with him soon.

[msg MSG_013 [Brown-haired girl]]
Mmhm, thanks!
Oh yeah, I haven't introduced myself[n]yet. My name is...
