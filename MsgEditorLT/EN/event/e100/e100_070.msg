[msg MSG_000 [Graceful woman]]
Would you please stop that? You're[n]frightening Hikari-san...

[msg MSG_001 [Ann]]
They're... not enemies?

[msg MSG_002 [Morgana]]
Seems as much.

[msg MSG_003 [Hikari]]
...A cat?

[msg MSG_004 [Akechi]]
We apologize for startling you two. And,[n]you are...?

[msg MSG_005 [Graceful woman]]
My name is Nagi. I am the acting curator[n]of this movie theater.

[msg MSG_006 [Ryuji]]
A curator!? So, this theater isn't[n]really abandoned!

[msg MSG_007 [Nagi]]
Could it be... that you've all been[n]trapped here as well?

[msg MSG_008 [Akechi]]
"As well"... Do you mean the same thing[n]has happened to you two?

[msg MSG_009 [Nagi]]
Yes... It all seems unbelievable, but it[n]happened in the blink of an eye.
When I came to, all of the customers had[n]disappeared and the entrance was[n]barred...
I quickly began searching the theater,[n]then found this customer―Hikari-san.

[msg MSG_010 [Hikari]]
......

[msg MSG_011 [Nagi]]
Due to my responsibility as curator,[n]I've taken her under my care.

[msg MSG_012 [Futaba]]
U-Uhhh... Um... I―U-Um...

[msg MSG_013 [Ann]]
Calm down, Futaba―it's okay!

[msg MSG_014 [Hikari]]
Ah, u-um...

[msg MSG_015 [Futaba]]
Y-Y-Yeah―Wait, huh?
You're, uh, you're shaking a lot...

[msg MSG_016 [Nagi]]
Yes―it's likely from the shock. She's[n]awfully frightened.
I've remained by her side in hopes of[n]staving off some of her anxiety...

[msg MSG_017 [Ann]]
Oh that's right―Hey, did you happen to[n]see Haru and Makoto anywhere!?
They're our friends, but we got[n]separated on the way here, so we're[n]looking for them now!

[msg MSG_018 [Hikari]]
...Your friends?

[msg MSG_019 [Ann]]
Mmhm, have you seen them? We've looked[n]everywhere, but we can't find them!

[msg MSG_020 [Nagi]]
What do your friends look like? Could[n]you provide us with descriptions, or[n]perhaps even photos?

[msg MSG_021 [Ann]]
Uhhh―well, one's all... spiky, and the[n]other one's... got an axe?

[msg MSG_021_5 [Ann]]
Oh, I know! Yusuke, could you sketch[n]them real quick?

[msg MSG_022 [Yusuke]]
I could if I had some supplies.

[msg MSG_023 [Nagi]]
Very well. I'll fetch you some suitable[n]materials.

[msg MSG_024 [Yusuke]]
They look like this.

[msg MSG_025 [Ann]]
Wow! That's so them!

[msg MSG_026 [Nagi]]
Oh, these two―if I recall correctly,[n]they were in the movie...
Isn't that right, Hikari-san?

[msg MSG_027 [Hikari]]
...Oh!

[msg MSG_028 [Morgana]]
You know them!?

[msg MSG_029 [Hikari]]
Oh―um...

[msg MSG_030 [Hikari]]
...Nagi-san? Uh...

[msg MSG_031]
Hikari is whispering to Nagi...

[msg MSG_032 [Ann]]
What's with the whispering?

[msg MSG_033 [Ryuji]]
She could just tell us herself―right,?

[sel SEL_034 top]
She's scared of you, Ryuji.
She's just being careful.
Let's wait and see what happens.

[msg MSG_035 [Morgana]]
Mm, that could definitely be why she's[n]so cautious.

[msg MSG_036 [Ryuji]]
Wha―!? Some weird talkin' cat's way[n]scarier than me!

[msg MSG_037 [Morgana]]
Don't call me weird!

[msg MSG_038 [Morgana]]
It can't be helped. After all, we've got[n]someone with us who looks like a common[n]thug.

[msg MSG_039 [Ryuji]]
Who're you callin' a thug!? A talkin'[n]cat's way weirder than me!

[msg MSG_040 [Morgana]]
Don't call me weird!

[msg MSG_041 [Yusuke]]
Agreed.
We have a blond thug and a talking[n]monster cat with us... Her defensiveness[n]is natural.

[msg MSG_042 [Ryuji]]
I ain't no thug!

[msg MSG_043 [Morgana]]
Don't call me a monster cat!

[msg MSG_044 [Hikari]]
......

[msg MSG_045 [Ann]]
Oh, looks like they're ready to share...

[msg MSG_046 [Nagi]]
Just as I'd thought―both Hikari-san and[n]I have seen your friends.
We saw them in the movie, just like the[n]rest of you.

[msg MSG_047 [Ryuji]]
Huh? Whaddaya mean, "in the movie"?

[msg MSG_048 [Nagi]]
Those two were originally with your[n]group, correct?

[msg MSG_049 [Ryuji]]
Uh, well―yeah, they were, but...

[msg MSG_050 [Yusuke]]
The "in the movie" part is what makes no[n]sense.

[msg MSG_051 [Morgana]]
We'll leave all that for later. So, what[n]exactly happened with those two?

[msg MSG_052 [Nagi]]
They've been captured by a character[n]named "Kamoshidaman."

[msg MSG_053 [Ann]]
Uh, Kamoshidaman?

[msg MSG_053_5 [Ann]]
Wait, Kamoshida―!? What's going on here?

[msg MSG_054 [Akechi]]
Hm? That sound...

[msg MSG_055 [Nagi]]
It's starting again...

[msg MSG_056 [Futaba]]
Wh-What's that supposed to mean!?

[msg MSG_057 [Nagi]]
I believe Doe has begun playing the[n]movie.

[msg MSG_058 [Yusuke]]
Doe? Movie?

[msg MSG_059 [Nagi]]
...You'll understand better if you see[n]it for yourselves.
