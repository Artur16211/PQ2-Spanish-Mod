[msg MSG_000 [Man's voice]]
Umm...

[msg MSG_001 [Caroline]]
Listen here: you all better make certain[n]to keep a close eye on our prisoner for[n]us!

[msg MSG_002 [Ryuji]]
Yeah, yeah...

[msg MSG_003 [Caroline]]
What insolence! Do you wish to be[n]executed as well!?

[msg MSG_004 [Futaba]]
She's so tough... A little girl AND[n]militaristic? I feel like I'm[n]discovering a new obsession!

[msg MSG_005 [Man's voice]]
Pardon me...

[msg MSG_006 [Ann]]
Yusuke, did you say something?

[msg MSG_007 [Yusuke]]
No, not I.

[msg MSG_008 [Ann]]
I thought I heard someone's voice...[n]Maybe I'm imagining things?

[msg MSG_009 [Man's voice]]
Um―just a moment of your time...

[msg MSG_010 [Yusuke]]
Ann, behind you―who's that?

[msg MSG_011 [Ann]]
Huh?

[msg MSG_012 [Man in blue]]
Ah, finally, someone noticed―

[msg MSG_013 [Ann]]
Aaaaaaaaaaah!

[msg MSG_014 [Man in blue]]
Waaaaaaaaaah!?

[msg MSG_015 [Ryuji]]
Why're you surprised too!? And more[n]importantly, who ARE you!?

[msg MSG_016 [Woman in blue]]
I can hear them call for me...

[msg MSG_017 [Futaba]]
A-A-ANOTHER ONE!?

[msg MSG_018 [Caroline]]
Hey, Justine...

[msg MSG_019 [Justine]]
Are those two...

[msg MSG_020 [Woman in blue]]
Everyone, we are most pleased to make[n]your acquaintance.

[msg MSG_021 [Ryuji]]
Who the hell are you guys!? And why are[n]you all blue!?

[msg MSG_022 [Woman in blue]]
I am Elizabeth. This here is my younger[n]brother, Theodore.

[msg MSG_023 [Theodore]]
Pleased to meet you―my name is Theodore.

[msg MSG_024 [Akechi]]
How long have you two been standing[n]there?

[msg MSG_025 [Elizabeth]]
*chuckle* We are always by your side,[n]any time, anywhere.

[msg MSG_026 [Ryuji]]
Oh great, more mind-warping shit...

[msg MSG_037 [Morgana]]
I don't get what's going on here... All[n]of this is so weird.

[msg MSG_038 [Yusuke]]
This world is full of mysteries. My own[n]comprehension cannot keep up in the[n]least, either.

[msg MSG_039 [Ann]]
Y'know, they're wearing similar clothes[n]to the twins. Could they be, like,[n]coworkers?

[msg MSG_040 [Theodore]]
Well... Maybe it's best to say that we[n]are all "attendants of the Velvet Room."

[msg MSG_041 [Elizabeth]]
Indeed―however, let's omit the details[n]for now, and instead cut to the chase.

[msg MSG_042 [Theodore]]
A-Ah, that's right!
While coming to this world, I was[n]separated from my guest...
I've searched everywhere in this movie[n]theater, but I've found nary a trace of[n]her.

[msg MSG_043 [Ryuji]]
Your guest? Does she wear all blue too?

[msg MSG_044 [Theodore]]
No, that isn't the case. She's a high-[n]school girl, wearing headphones...

[msg MSG_045 [Yusuke]]
Headphones?

[msg MSG_046 [Futaba]]
I've got headphones, but I'm not a[n]high-schooler.

[msg MSG_047 [Ann]]
I dunno... We haven't seen anyone like[n]that, right [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]?

[sel SEL_048 top]
We have not.
So she's lost too, then...

[msg MSG_049 [Nagi]]
I haven't a clue either...

[msg MSG_049_5 [Nagi]]
How about you, Hikari-san?

[msg MSG_050 [Hikari]]
No, I don't...

[msg MSG_051 [Theodore]]
I see. This is troubling...

[msg MSG_052 [Yusuke]]
Could this girl be inside the movie,[n]like how we were separated from our[n]friends?

[msg MSG_053 [Theodore]]
Inside the movie? Whatever do you―

[msg MSG_054 [Elizabeth]]
Theo, don't ask such frivolous[n]questions. You must simply perceive[n]their meaning.

[msg MSG_055 [Theodore]]
Ah, forgive me...

[msg MSG_056 [Ryuji]]
Okay, Theodore―I guess if we find this[n]girl, we'll go ahead and bring her back.

[msg MSG_057 [Theodore]]
Oh, thank you so much! It would be most[n]helpful.

[msg MSG_058 [Elizabeth]]
Theo, it takes more than attitude to[n]express one's gratitude.

[msg MSG_059 [Theodore]]
More than attitude? So you mean... I[n]need to bow deeply as well?

[msg MSG_060 [Elizabeth]]
Not in the least. According to my[n]intuition...

[msg MSG_061 [Elizabeth]]
I believe these people have slipped into[n]this world out of the blue and are now[n]trapped here.
And, mayhap, their only exit is secured[n]with numerous intimidating locks...

[msg MSG_062 [Ryuji]]
How'd you know all that!?

[msg MSG_063 [Theodore]]
Much happens in the course of life.[n]We've experienced quite a bit of it[n]ourselves.

[msg MSG_064 [Elizabeth]]
Our arrival here was inevitable as[n]well... We have been delivered here by[n]fate.

[msg MSG_064_5 [Elizabeth]]
That is why my foolish younger brother[n]Theodore will be providing you with all[n]the assistance you need.

[msg MSG_065 [Theodore]]
Huh? S-Sister!?

[msg MSG_066 [Elizabeth]]
"Good company on the road is the[n]shortest cut to one's grave," I believe[n]is the saying.
In any case, we must uphold the spirit[n]of helping those in need.

[sel SEL_067 top]
That would be great.
This sounds too fishy to me.
What kind of help, exactly?

[msg MSG_068 [Ann]]
I'm still lost here, but they don't seem[n]to be enemies...
The more people we've got helping us,[n]the better, right?

[msg MSG_069 [Akechi]]
So, how specifically would you be aiding[n]us?

[msg MSG_070 [Ryuji]]
Yeah, right? First we thought they were[n]with those twins, but it seems like[n]they're not.

[msg MSG_071 [Ann]]
But they don't look like enemies. Maybe[n]we'll be fine trusting them?

[msg MSG_072 [Akechi]]
So, how specifically would you be aiding[n]us?

[msg MSG_073 [Elizabeth]]
Well, is there any place nearby where we[n]can set up shop and fleece you―
...I mean, please you with our fine[n]wares, perchance?

[msg MSG_074 [Futaba]]
She totally just said "fleece you."

[msg MSG_075 [Elizabeth]]
I didn't hear that, laaalalaaa...

[msg MSG_076 [Futaba]]
I've been downvoted!

[msg MSG_077 [Ryuji]]
There's a concession stand in the lobby.[n]How 'bout there?

[msg MSG_078 [Nagi]]
If that would serve you properly, I'll[n]gladly show you the way...

[msg MSG_027 [Theodore]]
...Hm? Sister―those two, over there...

[msg MSG_028 [Elizabeth]]
Oh my, what have we here...

[msg MSG_029 [Caroline]]
Hmph...

[msg MSG_030 [Justine]]
......

[msg MSG_031 [Elizabeth]]
Hm, I see...

[msg MSG_031_5 [Elizabeth]]
Now listen here, Theo: It would be[n]uncouth to meddle in things beyond[n]necessity.

[msg MSG_032 [Theodore]]
But, Sister...

[msg MSG_033 [Elizabeth]]
Nothing meaningless happens. There must[n]be a reason for our summoning to this[n]place...
And searching for that reason may be[n]another necessity.

[msg MSG_034 [Caroline]]
Justine, who do you think they are?

[msg MSG_035 [Justine]]
I feel as if... they are related to the[n]core of our existence.
Who knows what our master will have to[n]say about this... Let's not delve any[n]further for now.

[msg MSG_036 [Caroline]]
Hmph, you're right... so long as they[n]don't interfere with the prisoner's[n]rehabilitation.

[msg MSG_079 [Caroline]]
Now listen up, Inmate! Until we escape[n]this theater, we'll allow you to move[n]about freely.

[msg MSG_080 [Justine]]
In other words, you're on parole. Do not[n]forget about your rehabilitation,[n]though.

[msg MSG_081 [Elizabeth]]
Now then, everyone, let us all skedaddle[n]to the concession stand...
