[msg MSG_000 [Ann]]
Whew... Looks like we're managing to[n]make some progress.

[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
Don't go lookin' down on the Phantom[n]Thieves! I don't wear out THAT easily!

[msg MSG_002 [Yusuke]]
Please, dial back the testosterone...

[msg MSG_003 [Ann]]
Just looking at him's starting to tire[n]me out...

[msg MSG_004 [Morgana]]
Are you all right, Panther? Sheesh,[n]why'd you have to go and upset her like[n]that!?

[msg MSG_005 [Ryuji]]
Wha―!? That's such bullshit!

[msg MSG_006 [Akechi]]
Shh! Someone's coming.
Let's hide until they pass by.

[msg MSG_007]
I can hear the voices of nearby[n]citizens...

[msg MSG_008 [Brazen man's voice]]
Did you hear? Seems like yet another[n]criminal's slipped into the city,[n]besides those thieves.

[msg MSG_009 [Weary woman's voice]]
That's so scary... What kind of[n]criminal?

[msg MSG_010 [Brazen man's voice]]
I don't know the details...

[msg MSG_011 [Weary woman's voice]]
Well, if they're defying Kamoshidaman,[n]they've gotta be criminals... right?

[msg MSG_012 [Brazen man's voice]]
That's what Kamoshidaman's saying, so I[n]guess they have to be.
I mean, even if I said I didn't think[n]so, that'd just be painting a target on[n]my own back.

[msg MSG_013 [Weary woman's voice]]
True―I'm pretty sure everyone else feels[n]the same, anyway...

[msg MSG_014]
The chatting voices grow fainter and[n]trail off...

[msg MSG_015 [Akechi]]
They're gone...

[msg MSG_016 [Ryuji]]
Dude, what the hell!? You can get called[n]a criminal just cuz Kamoshidaman said[n]so!?
They were all behind this punishment[n]thing, but they're not even thinkin' for[n]themselves!

[msg MSG_017 [Yusuke]]
"What Kamoshidaman is saying..."[n]"Everyone else feels the same..."
It seems as if they're just going along[n]with whatever those around them are[n]doing.

[msg MSG_018 [Ann]]
More importantly, it's clearer that[n]Kamoshidaman's not like the real[n]Kamoshida.
It didn't seem like those two people[n]were exactly superfans of his, either.

[msg MSG_019 [Morgana]]
Yeah, it seems to me like they're just[n]supporting him because he's in a[n]position of power...
Some kind of hero HE is! Might as well[n]be that emperor who paraded around in[n]his "new" clothes!

[msg MSG_020 [Akechi]]
They mentioned something else that I[n]found curious...
Do you remember how they said someone[n]else slipped into the city besides[n]ourselves?
Who could that be?

[msg MSG_021 [Yusuke]]
They didn't seem to be talking about[n]Queen or Noir...

[msg MSG_022 [Ryuji]]
Well, whoever they are, we just gotta[n]keep moving for now. Right, Joker?

[sel SEL_023 top]
Let's get going.
I'm curious about who it is too.

[msg MSG_024 [Morgana]]
Yeah, I'm really worried about those[n]two. Let's hurry up and find them!

[msg MSG_025 [Morgana]]
I can understand how you feel, but we[n]need to prioritize rescuing Queen and[n]Noir first.

[msg MSG_026 [Ryuji]]
Hell yeah! Let's blast our way through!

[msg MSG_027 [Ann]]
Hey, don't go rushing ahead by yourself!
...Then again, I guess all his energy is[n]doing the heavy lifting for us.

[msg MSG_028 [Yusuke]]
Ha―we oughtn't fall behind him, then.[n]Let's move out.
