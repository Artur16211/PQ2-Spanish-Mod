[msg MSG_000 [Ryuji]]
Alright! Let's hurry up and save Makoto[n]and Haru!

[msg MSG_001 [Ann]]
The inside of this movie seems pretty[n]complex, though. I hope we don't get[n]lost...
Futaba, can you navigate us?

[msg MSG_002 [Futaba]]
Hmm... I've been doing some testing, and[n]it seems I can't do it like usual.
It seems somewhat unstable, or... like I[n]can't get a clear grasp of any location[n]info.

[msg MSG_003 [Yusuke]]
Perhaps you're suffering from some form[n]of interference?

[msg MSG_004 [Akechi]]
It's possible that whoever brought about[n]this anomaly is tampering with her[n]readings.

[msg MSG_005 [Ryuji]]
Although, it's not like we can ditch our[n]friends. We gotta go, with or without[n]navigation.
Don't worry, I'm pretty in tune with my[n]sixth sense. It's my wild side's[n]intuition!

[msg MSG_006 [Morgana]]
I don't trust that in the least!

[msg MSG_007 [Hikari]]
Um―would this help you?

[msg MSG_008 [Yusuke]]
Hm? Is that... a notebook?

[msg MSG_009 [Hikari]]
Mmhm... Could you use this?

[msg MSG_010 [Futaba]]
Ooh, awesome! We can do it the[n]old-fashioned way!

[msg MSG_011 [Ann]]
I see, we won't have to worry about[n]getting lost if we draw our own map in[n]the notebook.

[msg MSG_012 [Futaba]]
, as you proceed through the movie, map[n]out your route and surroundings.
As long as you keep that thing updated,[n]you definitely won't get lost... I hope!

[msg MSG_013 [Morgana]]
Are you sure we can use this, Hikari? Do[n]you need it for anything?

[msg MSG_014 [Hikari]]
I, uh... I had that when I woke up[n]here...
I don't know what I was doing with it,[n]so I guess you can use it... Actually...[n]I want you to use it.

[msg MSG_015 [Ann]]
Then, don't mind if we do! Thanks a[n]bunch!

[msg MSG_016 [Hikari]]
......

[msg MSG_017 [Yusuke]]
, I believe that we should leave the map[n]creation up to you.

[sel SEL_018 top]
Alright, I'll handle it.
You're more qualified, though.
You'll be so great at it, Ryuji.

[msg MSG_019 [Yusuke]]
Yes, such a task would be best suited[n]for our leader.

[msg MSG_020 [Yusuke]]
True, I'm certain I would render a[n]beautiful map for us, but if you[n]entrusted that to me...
I believe that I'd use up the whole[n]notebook in a matter of a few minutes―is[n]that fine with you?

[msg MSG_021 [Ryuji]]
Of course not! The hell were you[n]plannin' on drawing!?

[msg MSG_021_5 [Ryuji]]
Y'know what, it's better to leave this[n]up to you, since you're our leader and[n]all.

[msg MSG_022 [Ryuji]]
No way, I can't do that kind of thing! I[n]swear, I get stuff like east and west[n]mixed up all the time!

[msg MSG_023 [Morgana]]
*sigh* We can't afford to get lost in[n]this movie... This job's best suited for[n]our leader.

[msg MSG_024 [Nagi]]
You still intend to go in there...[n]Please be sure that you don't push[n]yourselves too hard.

[msg MSG_025 [Ryuji]]
Heh, don't misunderestimate us! This'll[n]be a cinch.

[msg MSG_026 [Ann]]
I-If we jump into this screen, we'll[n]enter the movie... right?

[msg MSG_027 [Yusuke]]
This is quite a different process from[n]how we enter Palaces.

[msg MSG_028 [Ryuji]]
Alright! Let's go!

[msg MSG_028_1 [Ryuji]]
......

[msg MSG_029 [Ann]]
...Aren't you gonna go in?

[msg MSG_030 [Ryuji]]
Wha―Why do I have to go first? Yusuke!

[msg MSG_031 [Yusuke]]
We humans seem to have difficulty[n]steeling ourselves in the face of the[n]unknown.

[msg MSG_032 [Morgana]]
Sheesh... Really, you guys? [f 6 1 30 0 0 0], you[n]should take the first leap. Make us[n]proud!

[sel SEL_033 top]
Leave it to me.
After you, Morgana.
Let's all do it together.

[msg MSG_034 [Ann]]
Now that's our leader! You really are[n]great at this!

[msg MSG_035 [Morgana]]
Oh, okay, I'll go ahead and―
More like, hell no!
You've gotta take the leap of faith as[n]the leader of the Phantom Thieves.

[msg MSG_036 [Ann]]
Then, should we hold hands and step in[n]all at once?

[msg MSG_037 [Ryuji]]
Why make it so mushy!? This ain't the[n]end of some children's movie!
Sorry, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0], you gotta take the leap[n]of faith as our leader.

[msg MSG_038 [Futaba]]
Then it's decided. Take it away,!

[msg MSG_039 [Hikari]]
Everyone... Be careful...
