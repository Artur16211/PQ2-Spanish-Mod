[msg MSG_000 [Yusuke]]
...The concession stand?

[msg MSG_001 [Nagi]]
Would the merchandise here be of any use[n]to you?
Since the anomaly occurred, the stock[n]here appears to have changed quite a[n]bit...

[msg MSG_002]
It seems like equipment and items can be[n]purchased and sold at this concession[n]stand...
We'll also be able to store and retrieve[n]items here...

[msg MSG_003 [Ann]]
Wow! This'll be really helpful, don't[n]you think?

[msg MSG_004 [Morgana]]
Yeah, definitely. We should prep here[n]before heading into the movie...
After all, we could get attacked by[n]those weird guys again.

[msg MSG_005 [Ryuji]]
The cops are one thing, but that huge[n]one―what the hell was with that giant[n]birdlike thing?

[msg MSG_006 [Futaba]]
"Giant birdlike thing" is gonna be too[n]much effort to say every time you're[n]near one. Rename it.

[msg MSG_007 [Ryuji]]
Okay... how about Chicken Dude?

[msg MSG_008 [Ann]]
Too straightforward―and, super-lame.

[msg MSG_009 [Ryuji]]
Then you name it.

[msg MSG_010 [Ann]]
Huh―me? Umm...

[msg MSG_010_5 [Ann]]
...Chicky Peep-Peep?

[msg MSG_011 [Ryuji]]
Why'd you make it sound cute!?

[msg MSG_012 [Yusuke]]
Considering how fiercely it pursued us,[n]I'd name it, "The Raging Avian Sent from[n]Hell"!

[msg MSG_013 [Futaba]]
And we'll just ignore Inari...
Since it's a monster in a movie, why not[n]name it something movie-related?

[msg MSG_014 [Ryuji]]
Movie-related, huh? I don't really know[n]all that much about 'em.

[msg MSG_015 [Ann]]
Cinema... *sigh* Movie...

[msg MSG_016 [Nagi]]
A movie monster...
Perhaps something like, "Film Obscurit〒[n]※tendeu"?

[msg MSG_017 [Ryuji]]
Wait, what? Filmio Scurrytay...? Is that[n]some kinda tongue twister?

[msg MSG_018 [Nagi]]
Film Obscurit〒 ※tendeu... It means[n]"wickedness stored in the depths" in[n]French.

[msg MSG_019 [Ann]]
Why French, though?

[msg MSG_020 [Nagi]]
Well, movies originated in France.

[msg MSG_021 [Morgana]]
It's not bad... but it's too long. I[n]feel like my tongue'll get all tied up.
Let's see... Why don't we abbreviate[n]that to "FOE"?

[msg MSG_022 [Futaba]]
Mm, agreed! I'd be able to say that[n]without biting my tongue too.
Hey, are you cool with us calling that[n]strong, weird enemy an FOE?

[sel SEL_023 top]
Works for me.
Chicky Peep-Peep is way better.
I prefer Chicken Dude.

[msg MSG_024 [Morgana]]
It's decided then!

[msg MSG_025 [Ann]]
Agh... Please forget I ever said that...

[msg MSG_026 [Morgana]]
Let's just go with "FOE."

[msg MSG_027 [Ryuji]]
Cut it out, dude!

[msg MSG_028 [Morgana]]
Let's just go with "FOE."

[msg MSG_029 [Morgana]]
No matter the name, that FOE is[n]powerful. It'd be best for us to avoid[n]meddling with it.

[msg MSG_030 [Akechi]]
But why were we being pursued in the[n]first place?

[msg MSG_031 [Ryuji]]
Who cares? We'll figure it out later![n]Finding Makoto and Haru comes first,[n]yeah?

[msg MSG_032 [Akechi]]
Sorry, it's just a bad habit of mine,[n]what with being a detective and all.

[msg MSG_033 [Ryuji]]
Welp, let's get back to that freaky[n]screen.

[msg MSG_034 [Morgana]]
Hold on―Futaba, can you navigate us from[n]outside the movie?

[msg MSG_035 [Futaba]]
R-Right, um... I think I can manage...

[msg MSG_036 [Ann]]
Wait, we can't just leave Futaba here by[n]herself...

[msg MSG_037 [Morgana]]
We won't―I've decided to stay behind[n]too.
I want to investigate this theater and[n]see if I can gather some useful intel.

[msg MSG_038 [Ann]]
What sort of intel? Didn't we already[n]look everywhere we could?

[msg MSG_039 [Morgana]]
Everyone... can I talk with you for a[n]sec?

[msg MSG_040 [Yusuke]]
What's going on? Why the whispering?

[msg MSG_041 [Morgana]]
It's about Nagi and Hikari―they've been[n]nice to us, but we've only just met...
The best strategy right now would be to[n]investigate whether or not they're being[n]honest with us.

[msg MSG_042 [Yusuke]]
I see―you have a point.

[msg MSG_043 [Morgana]]
So, for now, you guys go check inside[n]the movie. Got that, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]?

[sel SEL_044 top]
Leave it to us.
We'll be back soon.

[msg MSG_045 [Morgana]]
All right, that's settled.

[msg MSG_046 [Akechi]]
We'll leave the remainder of the movie[n]theater to you.

[msg MSG_047 [Ryuji]]
So, uhh, Nagi-san, Hikari? Morgana and[n]Futaba are gonna stick around here.

[msg MSG_048 [Nagi]]
That's no problem for us, but...

[msg MSG_049 [Hikari]]
You're really going in there... Even[n]though it's dangerous...

[msg MSG_050 [Ryuji]]
Well, it's like I said before: our[n]friends are the ones in danger, so we've[n]gotta rescue 'em!
It's what friends do, yeah?

[msg MSG_051 [Hikari]]
......

[msg MSG_052 [Ryuji]]
...Eh, anyways―let's get going, guys.

[msg MSG_053 [Morgana]]
We're counting on you, but don't go too[n]far in there. Come back if there's an[n]issue.

[msg MSG_054 [Ann]]
Okay. You be safe too, Morgana.

[msg MSG_055 [Hikari]]
...W-Wait!

[msg MSG_056 [Akechi]]
Is there something else?

[msg MSG_057 [Hikari]]
Here, this [f 4 4 4 0 1348]...

[msg MSG_058]
Hikari is offering [f 4 4 4 0 1348] to[n]me...

[msg MSG_059 [Ann]]
Could that be for us?

[msg MSG_060 [Hikari]]
...Take it with you.

[sel SEL_061 top]
Thank you.
What's this for?
Oh, I prefer it unsalted.

[msg MSG_062 [Hikari]]
......

[msg MSG_063 [Hikari]]
Well... um...

[msg MSG_064 [Yusuke]]
Let's just thankfully accept her kind[n]offer. After all... it smells delicious.

[msg MSG_065 [Ann]]
Geez, can you even try to be modest!?

[msg MSG_066 [Hikari]]
Huh? Um...

[msg MSG_067 [Ann]]
Geez, can you even try to be modest!?

[msg MSG_067_5 [Ann]]
Um, sorry about that―thank you, we'll[n]take it with us!

[msg MSG_068 [Yusuke]]
Well then, we should begin our mission.

[msg MSG_069 [Ann]]
Our mission...

[msg MSG_070 [Ann]]
H-Hey, uh... I've been wondering...
If we go back inside the movie, we'll[n]most likely transform again, right?
Meaning, they'll watch us turn into the[n]Phantom Thieves!?

[msg MSG_071 [Nagi]]
Huh? The... Phantom Thieves?

[msg MSG_072 [Ryuji]]
Shit! She figured it out already!

[msg MSG_073 [Ann]]
W-Well, um... About the Phantom Thieves[n]thing...

[msg MSG_074 [Nagi]]
Is that from a recent criminal case? Or,[n]perhaps some new picaresque crime biopic[n]I've yet to hear of?

[msg MSG_075 [Hikari]]
I don't get it, either...

[msg MSG_076 [Ryuji]]
Seriously? You two don't know about the[n]Phantom Thieves!?
I'm blown away over here...

[msg MSG_077 [Nagi]]
I'm sorry, I don't keep up much with[n]current events―this goes for Hikari-san[n]as well, apparently.

[msg MSG_078 [Morgana]]
Quit pitching a fit about it! We don't[n]WANT them to know!

[msg MSG_079 [Nagi]]
Speaking of these Phantom Thieves, there[n]is one thing I'm rather curious about...
Were the costumes and special effects in[n]the movie cosplay-related, or some[n]similar situation?

[msg MSG_080 [Ann]]
She totally saw everything...

[msg MSG_081 [Akechi]]
About that, Nagi-san: we're not certain[n]ourselves...
While we're inside the movie, we can[n]somehow harness this power called a[n]"Persona."
It may be a similar situation to how the[n]hero in the movie was altered to become[n]Kamoshidaman.

[msg MSG_082 [Ryuji]]
Ooh, he really sold that!

[msg MSG_083 [Nagi]]
My, is that so?
*sigh* So many perplexing[n]developments... It'll take some time for[n]me to process all of this.

[msg MSG_084 [Akechi]]
It seems that we have a great deal of[n]investigation ahead of us. Let's hurry[n]back to the theater.
