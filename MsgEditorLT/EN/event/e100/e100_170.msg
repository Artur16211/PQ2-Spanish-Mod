[msg MSG_000 [Morgana]]
Nnnngh―it's no use... I can't get it[n]open...

[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
Whatcha up to?

[msg MSG_002 [Morgana]]
Can't you tell? I'm trying to pick the[n]lock on this door!

[msg MSG_003 [Futaba]]
What, you still haven't gotten it?

[msg MSG_004 [Morgana]]
I just started a minute ago!

[msg MSG_005 [Ann]]
That reminds me, Morgana―how about those[n]locks on the entrance?

[msg MSG_006 [Morgana]]
A-About that... I tried again, but I[n]still couldn't crack them...

[msg MSG_007 [Morgana]]
Mrow!?

[msg MSG_008 [Yusuke]]
I heard something in there... Could[n]someone be inside?

[msg MSG_009 [Ryuji]]
If someone's trapped in there, we can't[n]just leave 'em.

[sel SEL_010 top]
You're right―let's do this.
It could be dangerous...
Let's leave it be.

[msg MSG_011 [Yusuke]]
So we're going to open it, then... Let's[n]be sure to remain on guard.

[msg MSG_012 [Ryuji]]
But we're still gonna open it, right?

[msg MSG_013 [Yusuke]]
If we're going to open it, then let's be[n]sure to stay on guard.

[msg MSG_014 [Ryuji]]
Whoa, c'mon! What if somebody's trapped[n]in there!?

[msg MSG_015 [Yusuke]]
If we're going to open it, then let's be[n]sure to stay on guard.

[msg MSG_016 [Ann]]
Morgana―sorry to ask, but could you try[n]just a little more for me?

[msg MSG_017 [Morgana]]
O-Of course! Just you watch me, Lady[n]Ann!

[msg MSG_018 [Morgana]]
...But if a guard dog or something jumps[n]out, you'd better save me quick, got[n]it!?

[msg MSG_019 [Yusuke]]
One can only hope it's merely a dog...

[msg MSG_020 [Futaba]]
Mona, hurry up and open it.

[msg MSG_021 [Morgana]]
Ah―Okay, okay...
