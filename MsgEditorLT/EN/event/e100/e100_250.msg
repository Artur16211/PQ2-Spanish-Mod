[msg MSG_000 [P3 Fem Protag]]
This is... the movie theater?
I never would've imagined that world[n]could be connected to a place like[n]this...

[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
Yeah, we freaked out at first too.[n]Actually, we're still having a hard time[n]believin' it.

[msg MSG_002 [Nagi]]
Welcome, Miss [f 6 1 26 0 0 0]. I am Nagi, the[n]curator here.

[msg MSG_003 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Oh, hello! Nice to meet you. I'm [f 6 1[n]28 0 0 0].
Everyone told me a bit about this[n]theater before we got here.

[msg MSG_004 [Nagi]]
I've been watching everything from here.[n]I'm relieved to see that you're not[n]hurt.

[msg MSG_005 [Theodore]]
! Thank goodness you're all right.

[msg MSG_006 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Oh, Theo!
I'm so sorry I worried you. Everyone[n]here helped me find you.

[msg MSG_007 [Theodore]]
Please allow me to express my gratitude[n]to you as well...
Thank you so much for saving my precious[n]guest.

[sel SEL_008 top]
We just do what's right.
You're in our debt now.
So, you two are... close?

[msg MSG_009 [Ryuji]]
Yeah, what he said! We'd never ditch[n]somebody in trouble.

[msg MSG_010 [Theodore]]
My... Your kind consideration is greatly[n]appreciated.

[msg MSG_011 [Yusuke]]
So, I'd like to ask something―how are[n]you two affiliated?

[msg MSG_012 [Theodore]]
I see... Since we've become indebted to[n]you, then it's only proper to repay that[n]debt.
Let's see... Would 100 packs of takoyaki[n]suffice?

[msg MSG_013 [Ryuji]]
T-Takoyaki!?

[msg MSG_014 [Yusuke]]
I'd greatly appreciate it. I'd also ask[n]that you dress them in both mustard and[n]mayonnaise.

[msg MSG_015 [Ann]]
Geez, stop joking around! Theodore's[n]gonna take you seriously!

[msg MSG_016 [Yusuke]]
So, I'd like to ask something―how are[n]you two affiliated?

[msg MSG_017 [Yusuke]]
I've also been curious about that. Would[n]you mind if we ask how you two are[n]affiliated?

[msg MSG_018 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hmm, it's kinda hard to explain...
I guess he's someone that I've been[n]indebted to for some time now?

[msg MSG_019 [Ryuji]]
Wow, that's vague! ...But, it's not like[n]I'd understand a more complicated[n]explanation.

[msg MSG_020 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Wait, what in the world―Hey, guys? Your[n]clothes...

[msg MSG_021 [Yusuke]]
Oh, our clothes... So, they do return to[n]normal as we'd expected.

[msg MSG_022 [P3 Fem Protag]]
...Return? Do your clothes transform[n]into those cool outfits from earlier?

[msg MSG_023 [Ann]]
Uhhh, it's a long story, but basically,[n]it's like... a special feature we have?

[msg MSG_024 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Whoa, that's amazing―so cool!

[msg MSG_025 [Ann]]
Hey, y'know what? We haven't introduced[n]ourselves properly yet.

[msg MSG_026 [Ryuji]]
Oh, yeah. Welp, let's cover everything[n]so we can all share what we know so far.

[msg MSG_027 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Phantom Thieves that steal hearts in[n]cognitive worlds... I had no idea!
From what I've heard, we can both use[n]Personas, but the rules behind it seem[n]pretty different.

[msg MSG_028 [Ryuji]]
Your clothes don't change at all, huh?[n]Even though you use Personas too...

[msg MSG_029 [Futaba]]
Whoa!!! Y-Y-You're... You're the girl[n]from the movie...

[msg MSG_030 [Ryuji]]
Oh hey, Futaba, you finally turned up.

[msg MSG_031 [P3 Fem Protag]]
You're the girl who was acting as[n]navigator for everybody, right?

[msg MSG_031_5 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Thank you for rescuing me earlier!

[msg MSG_032 [Futaba]]
I-I-I didn't... d-didn't do anything in[n]p-particular!

[msg MSG_033 [Ann]]
Oh, sorry about that. She's a bit... shy[n]around strangers.

[msg MSG_034 [P3 Fem Protag]]
It's okay, everyone's a bit nervous in[n]the beginning. Nice to meet you,[n]Futaba-chan.

[msg MSG_035 [Futaba]]
U-Um, r-right...

[msg MSG_036 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Oh! Futaba-chan―those headphones!

[msg MSG_037 [Futaba]]
E-Eek!

[msg MSG_038 [P3 Fem Protag]]
They're so cool! Are you a music lover[n]too?

[msg MSG_039 [Futaba]]
Wh-Whoooa! You can tell how good these[n]are!? No one else has ever commented on[n]them...
... Could she be a fan of stuff like[n]that?

[sel SEL_040 top]
You've got a new friend.
Make sure you play nice.
She might be an otaku.

[msg MSG_041 [Futaba]]
Yeah, there oughtn't be any bad apples[n]among audiophiles.

[msg MSG_042 [Futaba]]
R-Right―I'm sure I can manage to have a[n]nice time if we've got something in[n]common!

[msg MSG_043 [Futaba]]
Ooh, so she's an audio geek... I wanna[n]have a heart-to-heart with her about it!

[msg MSG_044 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Oh yeah―Theo, what about the other[n]members of SEES? Have you seen Yukari,[n]or Junpei?

[msg MSG_045 [Theodore]]
I cannot say for certain at this moment,[n]but the possibility is quite high that[n]they are here as well, somewhere...
After all, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0] has come to this world[n]with his own companions in tow.

[msg MSG_046 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I see...
Hey, you're all trying to rescue your[n]friends trapped inside the movie, right?

[msg MSG_047 [Morgana]]
You know it! They're our treasured[n]accomplices.

[msg MSG_048 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I thought so!
If there's even the slightest[n]possibility my companions are here, I[n]want to look for them...

[msg MSG_048_5 [P3 Fem Protag]]
So I've made up my mind―let me come with[n]you! I'll help you look for your own[n]friends, too!

[msg MSG_049 [Morgana]]
Ooh, that would be great! You'd be a[n]priceless addition to the team!

[msg MSG_049_5 [Morgana]]
Well, I'm all for her joining us, but[n]what do you say?

[sel SEL_050 top]
Of course.
We'll make a great team.

[msg MSG_051 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Thanks, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]-kun! I hope we all get[n]along well!

[msg MSG_052 [Ann]]
Same here!
Don't worry, if we search together, I'm[n]sure we'll find your companions in no[n]time.

[msg MSG_053 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Thanks, Takamaki-san!

[msg MSG_054 [Ann]]
Call me Ann!
Plus, I've reached my wits' end being[n]surrounded by all these grungy guys!

[msg MSG_055 [Ryuji]]
Hey! Who're you callin' grungy!?

[msg MSG_056 [Hikari]]
......

[msg MSG_057 [P3 Fem Protag]]
And you're Hikari-chan? Everyone told me[n]about you...
Would it be okay for me to stay here[n]too?

[msg MSG_058 [Hikari]]
Huh? O-Oh, yes...

[msg MSG_059 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Thank you!

[msg MSG_060 [Hikari]]
Ah... U-Um...

[msg MSG_061 [Futaba]]
Wow... I swear, the new girl's social[n]skills are maxed out...

[msg MSG_062 [Yusuke]]
Yes―I sense an outgoing vibe from her[n]that's rather rare...

[msg MSG_063 [Ann]]
Do you think Hikari'll be okay, Futaba?

[msg MSG_064 [Futaba]]
Why're you asking me!?

[msg MSG_065 [Ann]]
Well... You know... You and Hikari are[n]both...

[sel SEL_066 top]
You two are really similar.
You're both pretty shy.

[msg MSG_067 [Futaba]]
Hrgh! I mean, it's not like I hadn't[n]noticed it...
But, she reminds me of how I was only a[n]little while ago, and it makes my heart[n]hurt a bit...

[msg MSG_068 [Futaba]]
Wha―Hey, I'm not THAT shy!

[msg MSG_068_5 [Futaba]]
But, she reminds me of how I was only a[n]little while ago, and it makes my heart[n]hurt a bit...

[msg MSG_069 [Ann]]
I see...
But―look at you now, Futaba! You're able[n]to talk to the rest of us like this...
I'm sure Hikari will eventually open up[n]too.

[msg MSG_070 [Futaba]]
Y-Yeah...

[msg MSG_071 [Akechi]]
Well then, why don't we give-san a quick[n]tour of this movie theater?
While we do that, I'm sure we'll have[n]the opportunity to make use of our[n]facilities.

[msg MSG_072 [Theodore]]
Ah, that reminds me! Speaking of[n]facilities, I'd like to show you all[n]something.

[msg MSG_073 [Futaba]]
Ooh, what's that?

[msg MSG_074 [Theodore]]
It's said that a picture is worth a[n]thousand words―now, please, follow me...
