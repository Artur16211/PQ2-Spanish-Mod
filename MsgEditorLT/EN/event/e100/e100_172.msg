[msg MSG_000 [Ann]]
Huh? A couple of kids!? Are they lost or[n]something?

[msg MSG_001 [Akechi]]
I'm not so sure about that―something[n]seems off about simply calling them lost[n]kids.

[msg MSG_002 [Caroline]]
What the―?

[msg MSG_003 [Justine]]
Where is our master?

[msg MSG_004 [Caroline]]
Justine! Look!

[msg MSG_005 [Justine]]
So, you're here as well, Inmate.

[msg MSG_006 [Caroline]]
Hey, Inmate, where are we!? What are you[n]doing here!?

[sel SEL_007 top]
No idea.
That's my line.
Take a guess.

[msg MSG_008 [Caroline]]
That look on your face... It seems you[n]truly don't know.

[msg MSG_009 [Caroline]]
How dare you!?

[msg MSG_010 [Justine]]
Hold, Caroline.
That look on his face... It seems he[n]truly doesn't know.

[msg MSG_011 [Caroline]]
Is this your doing!?

[msg MSG_012 [Justine]]
Hold, Caroline. I doubt such a simple[n]prisoner would be capable of that.
Most likely, he himself knows nothing of[n]this.

[msg MSG_013 [Caroline]]
Then... what happened?

[msg MSG_014 [Justine]]
I do not know.

[msg MSG_015 [Futaba]]
Ooooh, what little cutiiiies! And[n]they're TWINS!?

[msg MSG_016 [Ryuji]]
, you know these rugrats?

[msg MSG_017 [Caroline]]
Rugrats!?

[msg MSG_018 [Justine]]
Such blasphemy...

[msg MSG_019 [Morgana]]
Yeah, that's right! Quit being so rude[n]and show them some respect!

[sel SEL_020 top]
You know them too?
Talk about a betrayal...

[msg MSG_021 [Morgana]]
No, that's not it, but... I-It just[n]feels right?

[msg MSG_022 [Justine]]
At any rate, tell us of your[n]circumstances here, Inmate.

[msg MSG_023 [Caroline]]
We'll listen to what you have to say in[n]this room here―Hey, you! Cat!

[msg MSG_024 [Morgana]]
Y-Yes!?

[msg MSG_025 [Caroline]]
Escort the prisoner into our room. And[n]make it snappy!

[msg MSG_026 [Morgana]]
Wh-Why me?

[msg MSG_027 [Justine]]
......

[msg MSG_028 [Morgana]]
I-I'll do it... Of course! With[n]pleasure!

[msg MSG_029 [Caroline]]
Hmph―don't forget the rest of those[n]people as well.

[msg MSG_030 [Akechi]]
I guess we're "the rest of those[n]people"...

[msg MSG_031 [Ryuji]]
Seriously, who are they?
And Morgana, why're you takin' their[n]orders?

[sel SEL_032 top]
I bet he's fallen in love.
He's like their hired cat.

[msg MSG_033 [Ryuji]]
Whoa, for real? Which one?

[msg MSG_034 [Morgana]]
Don't be ridiculous! My love is only for[n]Lady Ann!

[msg MSG_035 [Morgana]]
I keep telling you, I am NOT a cat!
*sigh* Are you happy now? I'm starting[n]to get real tired of this repartee...

[msg MSG_036 [Ryuji]]
But that's, like, your trademark gag[n]now!

[msg MSG_037 [Morgana]]
...Those two have something "unwavering"[n]within them.
When they look at me with those eyes, I[n]get this feeling that I just have to[n]listen to them.

[sel SEL_038 top]
Like a kind of hypnosis?
Are you losing it?

[msg MSG_039 [Morgana]]
No, nothing like that. It's more like[n]there's something deep in my core...
This feeling that screams, "I have to do[n]what they say!" wells up inside me...

[msg MSG_040 [Ryuji]]
Nothing like that wells up in me...

[msg MSG_041 [Morgana]]
Well, it does for me! And, I have no[n]idea why...

[msg MSG_042 [Yusuke]]
If they're acquaintances of [f 6 1 30 0 0 0], I[n]believe we can trust them.

[msg MSG_043 [Morgana]]
It'll be fine. C'mon―can't make them[n]wait.
