[msg MSG_000 [Ryuji]]
Whoa... Is this for real!? We seriously[n]got inside the movie...

[msg MSG_001 [Yusuke]]
Now, how should we proceed from here? It[n]wouldn't be wise to wander around[n]aimlessly...

[msg MSG_002 [Ann]]
What's that noise?

[msg MSG_003 [Static-laced voice]]
...ey... Heeey!

[msg MSG_004 [Yusuke]]
Hm? Is that... Oracle?

[msg MSG_005 [Ann]]
Oracle! Can you hear us?

[msg MSG_006 [Futaba]]
Ah! Glad I got through to you guys.[n]Looks like you're doing just fine!

[msg MSG_007 [Ann]]
Wait a sec―why are you in phantom thief[n]attire too!?

[msg MSG_007_1 [Futaba]]
Search me... All I know is that my[n]outfit transformed the moment you guys[n]went into the movie.
How does all of this crazy stuff even[n]work?

[sel SEL_007_2 top]
It's just the Metaverse.
I don't know.

[msg MSG_007_3 [Futaba]]
Well, no point thinking about it too[n]hard―there's still an awful lot we don't[n]know yet.
Anyway, everything's good on this end,[n]so I'll back you all up, no problem!

[msg MSG_007_4 [Yusuke]]
In that case, sorry to ask for something[n]so quickly, but...
Could you possibly take a quick look[n]through the movie with your Persona's[n]powers?

[msg MSG_008 [Futaba]]
Nope. Already tried.
Even now, I can navigate you only[n]because I can tell where you guys are,[n]but that's all...
I can't see where Queen or Noir are,[n]either. Sorry...

[msg MSG_009 [Ryuji]]
Alright. Welp, we'll just have to look[n]for 'em.

[msg MSG_010 [Futaba]]
Still, it looks like I can back everyone[n]up in battle like usual.
Don't worry about that part!

[msg MSG_011 [Ann]]
Got it―and you can count on us to find[n]those two!

[msg MSG_012 [Futaba]]
All right then, make sure you draw your[n]map as you move along so you don't end[n]up lost later!
Any problems with using that notebook in[n]there?

[msg MSG_013 [Yusuke]]
Everything seems to be in order. Shall[n]we begin our exploration?
