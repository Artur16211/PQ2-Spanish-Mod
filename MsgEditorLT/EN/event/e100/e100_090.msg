[msg MSG_000 [Ryuji]]
So, that was totally Kamoshida, right!?

[msg MSG_001 [Ann]]
There's no way he's a hero of justice!

[msg MSG_002 [Nagi]]
Who is this Kamoshida that you speak of?[n]Do you all know him?

[msg MSG_003 [Ryuji]]
Yeah, he's a former teacher at our[n]school. Basically, he's an effin'[n]criminal scumbag.

[msg MSG_004 [Ann]]
But, why is Kamoshida in that movie? And[n]what's up with the goofy costume!?

[msg MSG_005 [Yusuke]]
That trailer made him out to be the[n]protagonist―is he in any other films[n]here?

[msg MSG_006 [Nagi]]
I have no idea―that movie you just[n]previewed has been the only one playing[n]all this time.

[msg MSG_007 [Akechi]]
What do you mean?

[msg MSG_008 [Nagi]]
It's truly odd... Ever since the anomaly[n]occurred, only that movie has been[n]playing in here.
Are you aware of the strange[n]projectionist currently in the[n]projection room?

[msg MSG_009 [Yusuke]]
I don't suppose you mean that eerie,[n]black object―the one that's all spongy?

[msg MSG_010 [Futaba]]
That's the projectionist!? It's not some[n]doll―it's alive!?

[msg MSG_011 [Nagi]]
We just call him that since he plays the[n]films, but we've no idea who or what he[n]may truly be.
That bizarre being appeared in the[n]projection room after the anomaly struck[n]this theater...
We know not his intentions―only that he[n]continues to play the same film, over[n]and over.

[msg MSG_012 [Hikari]]
He scares me... I-I don't want to get[n]near him...

[msg MSG_013 [Nagi]]
For the time being, we've been calling[n]him "Doe."

[msg MSG_014 [Ryuji]]
Dough? Like, cookie dough, dough?

[msg MSG_015 [Nagi]]
No, it comes from John Doe.

[msg MSG_016 [Ryuji]]
John who? Is that some kinda foreigner?[n]You know anyone with that name,?

[sel SEL_017 top]
I bet he's a legendary musician.
Sounds like some famous actor.
It's just a placeholder name.

[msg MSG_018 [Ann]]
Uh, that's not the name of some[n]celebrity...

[msg MSG_019 [Akechi]]
It's the name used for an unidentified[n]male corpse―primarily in police[n]investigations and autopsies.

[msg MSG_020 [Akechi]]
That's right! I'm surprised you knew.
It's the name used for an unidentified[n]male corpse―primarily in police[n]investigations and autopsies.

[msg MSG_021 [Yusuke]]
Has Doe done anything else besides[n]screening that movie?

[msg MSG_022 [Nagi]]
No... Nothing at all. He doesn't even[n]react when we speak to him.
He's a wholly mysterious oddity. We try[n]our best not to interact with him.

[msg MSG_023 [Hikari]]
......

[msg MSG_024 [Futaba]]
Reminds me of how I used to be...

[msg MSG_025 [Morgana]]
Hm? Did you say something, Futaba?

[msg MSG_026 [Futaba]]
Oh, nah. It's nothing.

[msg MSG_027 [Ann]]
But the movie Doe's playing―why is[n]Kamoshida in it at all, let alone in the[n]starring role?
Is there some kind of connection between[n]Doe and Kamoshida?

[msg MSG_028 [Yusuke]]
Or, perhaps it's a connection between[n]this theater and Kamoshida...

[msg MSG_029 [Nagi]]
Please wait a moment. It seems that[n]you've misunderstood...
Only since you all arrived here has the[n]movie become this one entitled[n]"Kamoshidaman."

[msg MSG_030 [Yusuke]]
"Become"?

[msg MSG_031 [Nagi]]
Before your arrival, the movie playing[n]in here was not titled "Kamoshidaman."

[msg MSG_032 [Ann]]
Wait, what!? Then, Kamoshida wasn't[n]originally the star?

[msg MSG_033 [Nagi]]
The film's plot was the same, but the[n]face and name of the hero were entirely[n]different.

[msg MSG_034 [Ann]]
How could a movie character suddenly[n]change like that, though?

[msg MSG_035 [Yusuke]]
So, all of these strange events,[n]including the adaptive film, are tied to[n]the anomaly...

[msg MSG_036 [Nagi]]
Your own leaping out of a movie as[n]well... This has been an unending series[n]of surprises.

[msg MSG_037 [Ryuji]]
Huh?

[msg MSG_038 [Ann]]
...What did you just say?

[msg MSG_039 [Yusuke]]
We leapt out of the film?

[msg MSG_040 [Nagi]]
Yes―you all suddenly popped out of the[n]theater's screen.

[msg MSG_041 [Ann]]
Wait, wait! How does that make any[n]sense!?

[msg MSG_042 [Nagi]]
But, you did indeed appear from the[n]screen... Hikari-san, you witnessed it[n]too, no?

[msg MSG_043 [Hikari]]
Mmhm...

[msg MSG_044 [Nagi]]
It was such a shock to us that we[n]hurriedly hid ourselves amongst the[n]seats.

[msg MSG_045 [Ryuji]]
Uh, yeah, it's seriously impossible to[n]just pass through a movie screen like―
