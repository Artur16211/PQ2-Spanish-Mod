It's finally time, you guys!
If that statue is Kamoshidaman's[n]weakness, this should interfere with his[n]powers!

[msg MSG_001 [Akechi]]
Well then, let's get into our positions.

[msg MSG_002 [Ryuji]]
Hell yeah! C'mon, Panther!

[msg MSG_003 [Ann]]
You got it! Just like we planned it,[n]Skull!

[msg MSG_003_5 [Ann]]
Just hang on, ladies... We're comin' for[n]you!

[msg MSG_004 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Leave the switchboard to me. I'll do my[n]part when the time's right!

[msg MSG_005 [Yusuke]]
I can prepare my prop immediately. I'll[n]send word when it's ready to go.

[msg MSG_006 [Morgana]]
Mm, then all we have to do is wait for[n]the right moment!

[msg MSG_007 [Loudspeaker]]
Citizens of Kamo City, this is a public[n]announcement...
The exhibition at Kamoshida Square for[n]punishing the evildoers will finally[n]begin.
I repeat...

[msg MSG_008 [Excited man]]
Looks like those folks who defied[n]Kamoshidaman are finally getting[n]punished!

[msg MSG_009 [Young woman]]
If Kamoshidaman says they're evil, then[n]it was bound to happen!

[msg MSG_010 [Kamoshidaman]]
HAHAHA! As you all know, I am the[n]absolute justice of this city!

[msg MSG_011 [Fanatic man]]
Yeah!

[msg MSG_012 [Middle-aged man]]
If we just follow Kamoshidaman, our city[n]will be peaceful, right!?

[msg MSG_013 [Kamoshidaman]]
Indeed! It is only through my existence[n]that Kamo City's peace is maintained!
However, violators of that peace have[n]appeared. Anyone who opposes me is evil[n]and a criminal!
And I shall punish this evil disrupting[n]our peace with my own justice!

[msg MSG_014 [Pleading woman]]
We're begging you, take care of the[n]criminals―for our sake!

[msg MSG_015 [Young boy]]
Kamoshidaman is justice, right? That's[n]what everyone's saying...

[msg MSG_016 [Old man]]
We believe in you, Kamoshidaman!

[msg MSG_017 [Ryuji]]
Psh, "my own justice" my ass! What an[n]effin' load of selfish bullshit!

[msg MSG_018 [Ann]]
He can make it sound as good as he[n]wants―all he's doing is suppressing[n]everyone with his power!

[msg MSG_019 [Yusuke]]
My apologies for the delay―the setup's[n]complete.

[msg MSG_020 [Ryuji]]
We're ready, too!

[msg MSG_021 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I'm so nervous that I'm sweating[n]daggers...
Wait, or is it supposed to be bullets?[n]Anyway―we've got no choice but to do[n]this!

[msg MSG_022 [Futaba]]
Looks like everyone's in position...
So, let's kick this heist off! Joker,[n]you do the honors!

[sel SEL_023 top]
Everyone―let's go!
We're taking that statue!

[msg MSG_024 [Morgana]]
We'll take him down for sure this time[n]and rescue Queen and Noir!
