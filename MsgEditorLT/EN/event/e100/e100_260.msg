[msg MSG_000 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Is this... a concession stand?

[msg MSG_001 [Elizabeth]]
Welcome, everyone.
I've been awaiting your arrival so[n]fervently that my eyes began to bulge[n]from my skull, like those of our master.

[msg MSG_002 [Theodore]]
They don't seem to be protruding any[n]more than usual, though...

[msg MSG_003 [Theodore]]
Nevertheless, Sister: please greet my[n]guest first.

[msg MSG_004 [Elizabeth]]
Ah, how incredibly rude of me.
My name is Elizabeth. I am Theodore's[n]older sister.
Theo has spoken nothing but glowing[n]praise of you, [f 6 1 27 0 0 0].

[msg MSG_005 [P3 Fem Protag]]
It's nice to meet you too―I've heard[n]about you from everyone else.
Still, I'm a bit surprised to find out[n]you have an older sister, Theo.

[msg MSG_006 [Theodore]]
My sister Elizabeth is a tad... no,[n]quite naive in certain respects.
I suspect she may cause you trouble, but[n]I hope that you manage to get along with[n]her, regardless.

[msg MSG_007 [Elizabeth]]
My motto is to do as I please, wherever[n]the wind may blow.

[msg MSG_008 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Did you also come here with Theo,[n]Elizabeth?

[msg MSG_009 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Elizabeth!

[msg MSG_010 [Elizabeth]]
My, [f 6 1 27 0 0 0]―I'm glad to see that you are[n]safe.

[msg MSG_011 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I've already heard all about it from the[n]others, but... To think you were brought[n]here too...

[msg MSG_012 [Elizabeth]]
Yes, it all happened in the blink of an[n]eye. When I came to, Theo and I were[n]here...

[msg MSG_013 [Theodore]]
Our master was not present, but we were[n]certainly within the Velvet Room when it[n]happened.
Despite this, all of a sudden, it[n]connected with this theater and even[n]changed its shape...

[msg MSG_014 [Elizabeth]]
The Velvet Room is a place inseparable[n]from our guests' fates.
There is a strict rule that "nothing[n]meaningless happens within it."

[msg MSG_015 [P3 Fem Protag]]
In other words, there's a meaning as to[n]why we came here?

[sel SEL_016 top]
And that meaning is?
Get us out of here.

[msg MSG_017 [Elizabeth]]
That answer will need to be discovered[n]by yourselves.

[msg MSG_018 [Elizabeth]]
We were whisked away here just as you[n]all were... There is nothing that we can[n]do about it either.

[msg MSG_019 [Elizabeth]]
Still, we have no intention to merely[n]sit back and watch what develops.
To aid you all on your journey, I have[n]forced Theo to prepare a shop for you[n]here.

[msg MSG_020 [Ryuji]]
Ooh! Don't mind if I do―

[msg MSG_021 [Elizabeth]]
One moment, please―there's one final[n]touch that must first be made...

[msg MSG_022 [Theodore]]
Sister? I believe that all the[n]preparations have been completed...

[msg MSG_023 [Elizabeth]]
This is all somewhat lackluster for the[n]grand opening of a shop.
A proper grand opening ritual should be[n]exciting, with bangs and booms.

[msg MSG_024 [Theodore]]
Ah...
O-Of course I knew that!
We must rouse our spirits with a bang[n]and boisterously begin commerce with a[n]boom!

[msg MSG_025 [Elizabeth]]
Yes, and for that, we must add our final[n]touch... Theo, come with me for a[n]moment.

[msg MSG_026]
Elizabeth dragged Theodore away by his[n]hand...

[msg MSG_027 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Elizabeth was so worked up, I couldn't[n]get in a word... I hope Theo will be[n]okay.

[msg MSG_028 [Ann]]
Oh, looks like they're back.

[msg MSG_029 [Theodore]]
We apologize for the delay...

[msg MSG_030 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Th-Theo!?

[msg MSG_031 [Theodore]]
Sister... Is this truly the attire[n]necessary for a grand opening such as[n]this?

[msg MSG_032 [Elizabeth]]
Theo―can you feel it? The curious[n]elation that's mingling with your deep,[n]rich embarrassment?

[msg MSG_032_5 [Elizabeth]]
That feeling is crucial to the grand[n]opening ritual! This costume is for[n]expressing your hospitality!

[msg MSG_033 [Theodore]]
Dear me―now that you mention it, I do[n]feel as if my heart is being uplifted...
...Oh, my! Even my balloon-holding arm[n]beckons me to the heavens!

[msg MSG_034 [Elizabeth]]
You mustn't forget to don this attire[n]when providing services to our guests,[n]understood?

[msg MSG_035 [Ann]]
...Should I bother pointing out how[n]wrong they are?

[msg MSG_036 [Ryuji]]
Just forget it―if you start now,[n]there'll be no end to it.

[msg MSG_037 [Futaba]]
An airhead and her put-upon brother...[n]This comedy sketch sorely needs a[n]straight man.

[msg MSG_038 [Theodore]]
Well then, everyone: I will be acting as[n]your vendor here at this concession[n]stand.
Not only will I be selling the current[n]merchandise, but I will continually add[n]new stock as well.

[msg MSG_039 [Yusuke]]
New stock? How will you receive[n]shipments in our current situation?

[msg MSG_040 [Theodore]]
I will process the materials that you[n]acquire within the movie into new[n]merchandise...
And, I will do so using this popcorn[n]maker!

[msg MSG_041 [Ann]]
Wait, what!?

[msg MSG_042 [Theodore]]
Allow me to demonstrate: for this[n]occasion, I have already prepared the[n]requisite materials.
I'll simply put them in the popcorn[n]maker―then flip the switch!

[msg MSG_043 [Theodore]]
There you have it: a brand new weapon.[n]See? Wasn't that easy?

[msg MSG_044 [Ryuji]]
But, how!? I don't even know where to[n]start with this nonsense!

[msg MSG_045 [Haru]]
That's probably the last thing that[n]should emerge from a popcorn maker...

[msg MSG_046 [Theodore]]
Popcorn is made by roasting corn kernels[n]and making their internal contents[n]expand...
In other words, it's the manifestation[n]of a kernel's hidden possibility.
Thus, this miraculous metamorphosis is[n]attainable only through a popcorn maker!

[msg MSG_047 [Ann]]
He somehow made that work!

[msg MSG_048 [Makoto]]
Very well, let's just leave it at[n]that...

[msg MSG_049 [Theodore]]
If there are any necessary materials[n]missing, I will notify you of such.
However, I will also indicate what you[n]lack based on the materials you've[n]brought back with you.
I hope you understand.

[msg MSG_050 [Akechi]]
So if we want to learn what's still[n]missing in a recipe, we need to possess[n]at least one of an item's components...

[msg MSG_051 [Yusuke]]
You mentioned that you're selling them,[n]yes? Even though you claim to be[n]providing us assistance...

[msg MSG_052 [Elizabeth]]
Everything has a price: that is how the[n]world works, and such providences shan't[n]change.
Please, inscribe that to your memory.

[msg MSG_053 [Theodore]]
I've taken over the duties here from[n]Miss Nagi, so please, continue your[n]patronage of this stand.
If there are any materials that you've[n]already sold here, I'll now add new[n]stock made from those.

[msg MSG_054 [Ryuji]]
Welp, now we got a shop and some more[n]companions. Looks like it's time for us[n]to go bust our asses.

[msg MSG_055 [Morgana]]
Once we get prepped in the theater,[n]let's head back into the movie...
I'm worried about Makoto and Haru.
