[msg MSG_000 [Makoto]]
Are you okay, Noir?

[msg MSG_001 [Haru]]
Mmhm... And you, Queen?

[msg MSG_002 [Makoto]]
I'm managing...

[msg MSG_003 [Haru]]
Where could we be? Is this Mementos? Or,[n]could it be a Palace?

[msg MSG_004 [Makoto]]
Not sure... Our intel's extremely[n]limited at the moment, on both[n]Kamoshidaman and this place.
The next time he shows up, I need to try[n]and get as much from him as I―

[msg MSG_005 [Kamoshidaman]]
HAHAHA!
What are you gossiping about? Have you[n]finally decided to confess your[n]misdeeds?

[msg MSG_006 [Makoto]]
Speak of the devil... I'm going to ask[n]one more time: where are we? Who are[n]you?

[msg MSG_007 [Kamoshidaman]]
Are you still groggy from your little[n]nap? Don't make me state the obvious!
This is my city, Kamo City, and I am the[n]reigning hero of absolute justice:[n]Kamoshidaman!

[msg MSG_008 [Makoto]]
Kamoshidaman? Not Suguru Kamoshida, the[n]former teacher at Shujin High?

[msg MSG_009 [Kamoshidaman]]
Shujin High? Former teacher? What are[n]you going on about?

[msg MSG_010 [Haru]]
You considered the school your own[n]castle and did whatever you wanted...

[msg MSG_011 [Kamoshidaman]]
A castle? Look at you two, blathering[n]even more nonsense. I've had enough of[n]this balderdash!

[msg MSG_012 [Makoto]]
Just as I thought―he looks like[n]Kamoshida, but he's a totally different[n]person...

[msg MSG_013 [Kamoshidaman]]
More importantly, I have news for you―[n]the details of your punishment have been[n]decided.
You are to be executed as enemies of the[n]city and wretched opponents of myself.

[msg MSG_014 [Haru]]
E-Executed?

[msg MSG_015 [Kamoshidaman]]
Indeed. Judgment must be laid down upon[n]evil...
And it shall be done by my hand―the[n]absolutely just hand of Kamoshidaman!

[msg MSG_016 [Makoto]]
I refuse to accept this. We've done[n]nothing wrong!

[msg MSG_017 [Kamoshidaman]]
HAHAHA! Evil or just―I'm the one who[n]makes the decision. That is my duty as[n]the head of Kamo City!
If I do not lead the citizens, this city[n]will plunge into chaos.
Can't you hear them... the voices of the[n]people yearning for peace?

[msg MSG_018 [Curious woman]]
Those two... are the evil threatening[n]Kamo City?

[msg MSG_019 [Brazen man]]
That's what Kamoshidaman said, so it's[n]gotta be true!

[msg MSG_020 [Weary woman]]
Yeah... All we have to do is listen to[n]whatever Kamoshidaman says.

[msg MSG_021 [Agitated man]]
Anyone defying Kamoshidaman is evil![n]That's what everybody says!

[msg MSG_022 [Kamoshidaman]]
HAHAHA! Now do you understand?
All I'm doing is fulfilling my duty as[n]the mighty ruler of these powerless[n]citizens.

[msg MSG_023 [Makoto]]
The people in this city are just being[n]controlled by you―they don't believe in[n]what you say!

[msg MSG_024 [Kamoshidaman]]
Whoever has the power decides the rules![n]Defying such power is nonsense!

[msg MSG_024_5 [Kamoshidaman]]
You should feel honored to be punished[n]by me, the hero of absolute justice![n]HAHAHA!

[msg MSG_025 [Haru]]
So you're the arbiter of what's good and[n]bad, just because you have the most[n]power? That's not right!

[msg MSG_026 [Makoto]]
We won't let you just do as you please[n]with us! I'm certain that Joker and the[n]others will...

[msg MSG_027 [Kamoshidaman]]
Not even a single word of apology, eh?[n]It seems you aren't very penitent yet.

[msg MSG_028 [Kamoshidaman]]
Well then―get on your knees and beg[n]before all the citizens and I just may[n]forgive you.

[msg MSG_029 [Haru]]
I'd never do such a thing!

[msg MSG_030 [Kamoshidaman]]
How foolish it is to defy the strong,[n]and how righteous it is to obey one's[n]ruler...
You will make an excellent opportunity[n]to remind the citizens of these facts.
Let's hold off the execution a bit[n]longer. Reflect upon your actions until[n]then! HAHAHA!

[msg MSG_031 [Kamoshidaman]]
Keep a keen eye on these two. They're[n]bent on destroying the peace of my city!

[msg MSG_032 [Fat policeman]]
Sir!

[msg MSG_033 [Makoto]]
What a deplorable excuse for justice. I[n]can't believe everyone just obeys him...

[msg MSG_034 [Fat policeman]]
Watch it! Kamoshidaman is what everyone[n]strives to be.
Even your captor was a colleague of ours[n]who models himself after our hero.

[msg MSG_035 [Haru]]
Wait... Do you mean the thing that[n]attacked us?

[msg MSG_036 [Makoto]]
Now that you mention it, that costume...[n]It was like a cruder version of[n]Kamoshidaman's.

[msg MSG_037 [Fat policeman]]
Hmph. No matter how much you resist,[n]you'll never win against Kamoshidaman.
As long as we still have "that" around,[n]Kamoshidaman is invincible!

[msg MSG_038 [Haru]]
..."That"?

[msg MSG_039 [Fat policeman]]
Then again, Kamoshidaman has judged you[n]as evil, so there's no escaping your[n]punishment...

[msg MSG_039_5 [Fat policeman]]
No matter how much you plead, all you[n]can do is sit there and wait for death.[n]Hahaha!

[msg MSG_040 [Haru]]
If he's invincible as long as he has[n]"that"...

[msg MSG_041 [Makoto]]
Then the inverse should be true: he can[n]be harmed once "that" is gone. But, what[n]could it be?
