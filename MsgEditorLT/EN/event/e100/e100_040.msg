[msg MSG_000 [Futaba]]
It's no use. They're not here at all...

[msg MSG_001 [Ann]]
We even found that whole row of doors[n]that won't open. What's going on here?

[msg MSG_002 [Yusuke]]
It's as if we've been spirited away...[n]This whole place is a true mystery.

[msg MSG_003 [Akechi]]
All signs do point to this being a movie[n]theater, but something still feels[n]off...
We haven't found a trace of anyone else[n]here.

[msg MSG_004 [Ryuji]]
Seriously―how the hell'd we end up here?

[sel SEL_005 top]
I bet we fell from above.
Maybe through the side?
I think we rose upwards.

[msg MSG_006 [Akechi]]
Hmm... I don't recall any sensation of[n]falling, though.

[msg MSG_007 [Ryuji]]
Hang on―what does it matter, upwards or[n]downwards!?

[msg MSG_008 [Akechi]]
True... It felt more like a horizontal[n]displacement than a vertical one.

[msg MSG_009 [Ryuji]]
Uh, but from where!?

[msg MSG_010 [Akechi]]
Oh, like we welled up here? Haha, that's[n]a funny way to put it.

[msg MSG_011 [Ryuji]]
Wait, what're you even talking about!?

[msg MSG_012 [Morgana's voice]]
Hey, everybody! C'mere for a second!

[msg MSG_013 [Ann]]
Maybe Morgana found something!

[msg MSG_014 [Yusuke]]
Let's get over there, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0].
