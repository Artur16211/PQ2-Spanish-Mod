This is our declaration against the[n]superficial hero!

[msg MSG_001 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I hope you're ready!

[msg MSG_002 [Kamoshidaman]]
You bastards...

[msg MSG_003 [Ann]]
We did it!

[msg MSG_004 [Ryuji]]
Yep, that's that!

[msg MSG_005 [Yusuke]]
*chuckle* It seems that counterfeits can[n]be quite useful at times.

[msg MSG_006 [Kamoshidaman]]
You bastards! What did you do!?

[msg MSG_007 [Morgana]]
We're the Phantom Thieves. If we wanna[n]steal something, we get it done!

[msg MSG_008 [Kamoshidaman]]
Grrr... How dare you defy me, you[n]insolent brats!

[msg MSG_009 [Wavering man]]
Phantom Thieves? But, they're[n]criminals... right!?

[msg MSG_010 [Angry man]]
Kamoshidaman, punish them!

[msg MSG_011 [Teared up woman]]
Kamoshidaman...

[msg MSG_012 [Yusuke]]
So, what's your response?

[msg MSG_013 [Ryuji]]
Your so-called "justice" is through!

[msg MSG_014 [Kamoshidaman]]
Silence, thieves! You're all evildoers[n]for agitating the citizens!
My existence is justice incarnate here[n]in Kamo City!

[msg MSG_015 [Kamoshidaman]]
I'll show you the power of a hero!

[msg MSG_016 [Morgana]]
Here he comes!

[msg MSG_017 [Kamoshidaman]]
Hraaaaaaaaah... Justice will win!
