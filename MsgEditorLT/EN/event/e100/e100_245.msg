[msg MSG_000 [P3 Fem Protag]]
It's nice to meet you all.

[msg MSG_001 [Yusuke]]
Some sort of fate must have led our[n]paths to cross―it's a pleasure meeting[n]you as well.

[msg MSG_002 [P3 Fem Protag]]
So, um, there's something I've been[n]curious about since I first saw you[n]all...
It's not just your masks, but all your[n]outfits―they kinda make me think of[n]phantom thieves.

[msg MSG_003 [Ryuji]]
Ohhh shit, this is bad! Did she figure[n]out who we are!?

[msg MSG_004 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Who you are?

[msg MSG_005 [Morgana]]
Skull, you moron! Stop digging our[n]graves!

[msg MSG_006 [Yusuke]]
This isn't good... How should we explain[n]our attire?

[sel SEL_007 top]
We're all just cosplaying.
These are our uniforms for work.
We're THE Phantom Thieves.

[msg MSG_008 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Is that what's popular right now? Or,[n]are they for some kind of costume party?

[msg MSG_009 [Ann]]
Y-Yeah... something like that! We're all[n]like, "Par-tay, woot wooooot!"

[msg MSG_010 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Woot...? I don't really get what you[n]mean, but it sounds fun!

[msg MSG_011 [P3 Fem Protag]]
So your jobs are to cosplay as phantom[n]thieves, or you're all thieves that were[n]hired to cosplay...?

[msg MSG_012 [Ann]]
Umm, yeah... Don't think too much about[n]it.

[msg MSG_012_5 [Ann]]
Phantom thieves are big right now, so we[n]kinda just... went with the flow? Or[n]some crap?

[msg MSG_013 [Ryuji]]
Don't call our cover "crap"!

[msg MSG_014 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Ooh, really? I don't totally get it, but[n]it sounds fun!

[msg MSG_015 [P3 Fem Protag]]
"The" Phantom Thieves?

[msg MSG_016 [Ryuji]]
You CORRECTED her!?

[msg MSG_017 [Yusuke]]
But... she doesn't seem to fully[n]comprehend.

[msg MSG_018 [Akechi]]
Could you possibly be unaware of the[n]Phantom Thieves?

[msg MSG_019 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Huh?

[msg MSG_020 [Ann]]
No way! It's been all over the news and[n]the internet every day lately...
You really haven't heard of the "Phantom[n]Thieves of Hearts"?

[msg MSG_021 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Sorry, no clue―I watch the news pretty[n]regularly, too.

[msg MSG_022 [Ryuji]]
Whoa, she really doesn't know! Maybe the[n]Phantom Thieves aren't nationally famous[n]yet?

[msg MSG_023 [Akechi]]
The news can differ based on prefecture.[n]But, even still...

[msg MSG_024 [Yusuke]]
Well, doesn't this only work to our[n]convenience?
I believe that we should prioritize[n]escaping from here at the moment,[n]anyway.

[msg MSG_025 [Akechi]]
Oh, right... Those citizens we hid from[n]were likely referring to her when they[n]were talking about "another criminal."
If that's the case, we oughtn't chat[n]here any longer―we should go back to the[n]theater where it's safer.

[msg MSG_026 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Theater? I'm sorry, but I have no idea[n]where one is around here.

[msg MSG_027 [Morgana]]
Looks like we know more than she does[n]about what's going on right now.

[msg MSG_028 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Whoa! The cat talked!?

[msg MSG_029 [Morgana]]
I am NOT a cat!
And NOW you're reacting to this!? We[n]were fighting next to each other just a[n]second ago!

[msg MSG_030 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Oh yeah, you're right... So, he's a[n]Persona-user too, I'm guessing?

[sel SEL_031 top]
That's right.
He's just a lil' meow-meow.
It's a long story...

[msg MSG_032 [Morgana]]
Hell no! I don't care how adorable you[n]make it sound―just, HELL NO!
...Now I'm exhausted.

[msg MSG_033 [Morgana]]
That's right. I take on this form[n]because of the distortion from Mementos,[n]where―

[msg MSG_034 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Mementos?

[msg MSG_035 [Ryuji]]
Yeah, yeah―we'll talk about all that[n]later.

[msg MSG_036 [Yusuke]]
That may be the case with Morgana, but[n]shouldn't we explain ourselves as well?
We're all Persona-users... I'm certain[n]she'd understand our circumstances.

[sel SEL_037 top]
That's true.
Let's get out of this movie first.

[msg MSG_038 [Yusuke]]
We can talk about it while we return to[n]the theater.

[msg MSG_039 [Ann]]
I agree. We should reunite her with[n]Theodore as soon as possible.

[msg MSG_040 [P3 Fem Protag]]
If you can take me to Theo, then please,[n]let me join you!

[msg MSG_041 [Ryuji]]
Then it's decided―let's get back to the[n]theater.
