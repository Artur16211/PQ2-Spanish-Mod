[msg MSG_000 [Ryuji]]
Welp, now that we figured out that weird[n]mystery, let's go look for Makoto and[n]Haru.

[msg MSG_001 [Yusuke]]
Before that―Morgana, there's something[n]I'd like to ask you...
After we entered the movie, were you[n]able to see us from your side of the[n]screen?

[msg MSG_002 [Morgana]]
Yeah, you were definitely onscreen. It[n]was like you were just characters in the[n]movie.

[msg MSG_003 [Akechi]]
Oh? Now that's interesting. I'd like to[n]see that from here as well.

[msg MSG_004 [Morgana]]
However, there was one weird thing...
Unless you all progressed onward, the[n]same scene of the movie would loop.

[msg MSG_005 [Ann]]
Huh?

[msg MSG_006 [Futaba]]
It looked like the movie was on repeat―[n]when you guys moved on, the movie would[n]progress too.

[msg MSG_007 [Yusuke]]
Essentially, we're developing the plot[n]as if we were the actors within it.
This is a rather unprecedented creative[n]activity.

[msg MSG_008 [Ann]]
Hey, Morgana, did you ever end up[n]finding any clues here in the theater?

[msg MSG_009 [Morgana]]
No... I looked everywhere, but there[n]isn't a single trace of Makoto and Haru[n]here.
If we're gonna look for them, it'd be[n]best to do it within the movie...
So, from here on out, I'm getting in on[n]the action!

[msg MSG_010 [Ann]]
That's reassuring to hear, but... will[n]it really be okay to leave Futaba here[n]by herself?

[sel SEL_011 top]
That idea's troubling me.
She can do it.
I'm not exactly convinced...

[msg MSG_012 [Futaba]]
Wh-What!? Is this a heartfelt confession[n]of your trust in me?

[msg MSG_013 [Futaba]]
Why? Is it just because I'm[n]devastatingly shy around strangers!?

[msg MSG_014 [Morgana]]
No, not at all!
Wait―actually, that is basically it.

[msg MSG_015 [Morgana]]
Hey, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]―c'mere for a sec...

[msg MSG_016]
When I bend down, Morgana whispers to[n]me...

[msg MSG_017 [Morgana]]
...When I was tailing Hikari and Nagi,[n]they didn't do anything suspicious.
I don't think there'll be any problems[n]leaving Futaba here with them.

[msg MSG_018 [Futaba]]
Don't you worry about me―I'll just hang[n]out here with our new blue buds.
Plus, if something bad were to happen[n]out here, it'd be sucky if no one was[n]around to report it to you.
I'll stick to navigation and serve as[n]your contact on this end! Any[n]objections?

[msg MSG_019 [Yusuke]]
Your assistance would be greatly[n]appreciated. We'll all be relying on[n]you.

[msg MSG_020 [Morgana]]
It's decided, then!

[msg MSG_021 [Hikari]]
...You're going too, Morgana?

[msg MSG_022 [Morgana]]
Of course I am. I've got some serious[n]skills myself, y'know?

[msg MSG_023 [Hikari]]
You might be able to fight... but...

[msg MSG_024 [Morgana]]
Nya-haha! Just sit back and watch.
Right, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]? We've made it through[n]thick and thin together!

[sel SEL_025 top]
No need to worry about us.
We don't ditch our friends.

[msg MSG_026 [Hikari]]
......

[msg MSG_027 [Morgana]]
Yeah, what he said! All right, let's[n]roll out, guys!

[msg MSG_028 [Futaba]]
Okay, then you'd better first look over[n]who's going to be doing the fighting.
If you all just bumble around in a[n]group, it'll be way easier for the enemy[n]to find you.

[msg MSG_029 [Morgana]]
True―there's also our party formation to[n]consider, with both front and back[n]positions available to us.
Members in the back line take less[n]damage from enemies than party members[n]in the front line.
