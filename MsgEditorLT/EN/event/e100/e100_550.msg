[msg MSG_000 [Haru]]
Wow, so many locks...

[msg MSG_001 [Makoto]]
You had told us that we were locked in,[n]but this is so far beyond any standard[n]security measure, it's bizarre...

[msg MSG_002 [Morgana]]
Yeah, even my picking skills were no[n]match for them.
We've been hoping that unlocking them[n]all will get us out of here.

[msg MSG_003 [Nagi]]
Are you truly going to test it out? What[n]if... the worst were to happen?

[msg MSG_004 [Morgana]]
If that happens, then we'll deal with[n]it. Now, try using that key, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0].

[sel SEL_005 top]
Roger that.
This is scary, though...
Who wants to open the door?

[msg MSG_006 [Akechi]]
Bravery like that is just what we'd[n]expect from you, Leader.

[msg MSG_007 [Yusuke]]
If we go down, we'll all go down[n]together.

[msg MSG_010 [Ann]]
Oh, are we doing this by a show of[n]hands?

[msg MSG_011 [Morgana]]
Agh, come on! This is obviously calling[n]for our leader to do it!

[msg MSG_012 [Yusuke]]
Don't worry. If we go down, we'll all go[n]down together.

[msg MSG_013]
I should try using the key...
