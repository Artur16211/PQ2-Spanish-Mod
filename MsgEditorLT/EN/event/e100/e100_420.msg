Movie theater, box office...
Akechi is talking to Elizabeth...

[msg MSG_001 [Akechi]]
Ah, you've stopped by.

[sel SEL_002 top]
Hope I'm not intruding.
I'm in rarefied air here.

[msg MSG_003 [Akechi]]
It's nothing so serious.
There was just something that made me[n]curious earlier, so I wanted to ask her[n]about it.

[msg MSG_004 [Elizabeth]]
Aha, so this must be what is called an[n]"interrogation"... I'm rather excited to[n]be experiencing this firsthand.

[sel SEL_005 top]
You're interrogating her?
That's exciting to you?

[msg MSG_006 [Akechi]]
As I said before, it's nothing so[n]serious― merely a simple question.

[msg MSG_007 [Elizabeth]]
Well, that is unfortunate―I was hoping[n]to experience it with a serving of[n]"Katsu Dune"...

[msg MSG_008 [Akechi]]
Haha, you mean how cop shows offer pork[n]bowls to suspects when they interrogate[n]them? That's purely fictional.
This is merely to satisfy my personal[n]curiosity.

[msg MSG_009 [Akechi]]
You mentioned earlier that nothing[n]meaningless happens in the Velvet[n]Room...
Then, how would you explain-san's[n]presence?

[sel SEL_010 top]
What do you mean?
She's... the one behind all this!?

[msg MSG_011 [Elizabeth]]
*chuckle* To think you'd come to such a[n]conclusion... Truly, you are well-suited[n]for detective duties.

[msg MSG_012 [Akechi]]
If memory serves me correctly,-san came[n]here through the Velvet Room...
What I want to ask is, if that in itself[n]has any meaning to it.

[msg MSG_013 [Elizabeth]]
Yes, I do believe that the solo arrival[n]of [f 6 1 27 0 0 0] is no mere coincidence...
However, that does not apply to her[n]alone.

[msg MSG_014 [Akechi]]
What do you mean?

[msg MSG_015 [Elizabeth]]
Since you've also encountered attendants[n]of the Velvet Room...
Your presence here was also inevitable,[n]and there is some meaning to it...

[msg MSG_016 [Akechi]]
A meaning, hm... But that meaning[n]doesn't involve you directly, correct?
So, all our answers lie beyond the end[n]of the movie...

[sel SEL_017 top]
I'm curious how it'll end.
Let's work on the plan.

[msg MSG_018 [Elizabeth]]
Whether or not you reach that end is[n]dependent on you all...
You all seem to be scheming something...[n]It's making my heart race just[n]witnessing you all in action.

[msg MSG_019 [Akechi]]
Our plan must succeed if we're to learn[n]everything.

[msg MSG_020 [Elizabeth]]
Yes, I believe that would be a most wise[n]decision.
Whether or not you reach the movie's end[n]is wholly dependent on you all.

[msg MSG_021 [Akechi]]
Yes―and for that, we need to ensure this[n]plan succeeds.

[msg MSG_022]
It seems things are okay here. I should[n]head back for the time being...

[msg MSG_023]
It seems things are okay here. Maybe I[n]should go check on the others...
