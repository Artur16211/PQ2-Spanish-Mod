[msg MSG_000 [Haru]]
So, this is the movie theater you[n]mentioned... Wow, we really were inside[n]a movie...

[msg MSG_001 [Makoto]]
It's a strange feeling to know that we[n]could be seen from here.

[msg MSG_002 [Ryuji]]
And, it's still a mystery why Kamoshida[n]was in it.

[msg MSG_003 [Haru]]
According to what you said, the city's[n]original hero was different...

[msg MSG_004 [Morgana]]
Right―he seems to have changed to[n]Kamoshidaman after we got here.

[msg MSG_005 [Akechi]]
Supposedly, someone totally different[n]initially filled his role.

[msg MSG_006 [Makoto]]
Hmm. This is merely a guess, but[n]perhaps... the movie was edited due to a[n]personal correlation?
Such as, changing our opponent to a[n]person familiar to us.

[msg MSG_007 [Ryuji]]
Eh? So, you're sayin' there's something[n]in common between Kamoshida and that[n]hero?

[msg MSG_008 [Yusuke]]
If what Makoto says is true...
A person symbolically similar to this[n]movie's character was pulled from our[n]real world.
So, in other words, he was "cast" into[n]that role.

[msg MSG_009 [Nagi]]
Everyone―thank goodness you're safe. I[n]hope none of you are hurt?

[msg MSG_010 [Makoto]]
Um, are you two the ones they met[n]earlier in this movie theater?

[msg MSG_011 [Nagi]]
Yes, I am Nagi, the curator. This is[n]Hikari-san.

[msg MSG_012 [Hikari]]
......

[msg MSG_013 [Haru]]
Nice to meet you―my name's Haru Okumura.

[msg MSG_014 [Makoto]]
I'm Makoto Niijima. We're friends of[n]theirs.

[msg MSG_015 [Hikari]]
......

[msg MSG_016 [Makoto]]
Um...

[msg MSG_017 [Ann]]
Ah, she's a little shy... Sorta like how[n]Futaba used to be.

[msg MSG_018 [Ryuji]]
So, Hikari, how was the movie?

[msg MSG_018_5 [Ryuji]]
We took down Kamoshidaman! I hope you[n]saw that!

[msg MSG_019 [Hikari]]
...Yes, I did.

[msg MSG_020 [Ryuji]]
You've had to watch that shitty movie[n]all this time, right?
Don'tcha finally feel better now that[n]it's got a proper ending?

[msg MSG_021 [Hikari]]
Mmhm...

[msg MSG_022 [Ryuji]]
Yeah!?

[msg MSG_023 [Hikari]]
I'm glad... that you rescued your[n]friends, too.

[msg MSG_024 [Haru]]
So, you were worried about us. Thank[n]you.

[msg MSG_025 [Hikari]]
Oh―um...

[msg MSG_026 [Morgana]]
But, you get it now, right?

[msg MSG_026_5 [Morgana]]
Nothing's impossible for us! Right,?

[sel SEL_027 top]
That's right.
Well, some things are.
Weren't we kickass?

[msg MSG_028 [Hikari]]
......

[msg MSG_029 [Morgana]]
Hmm, she doesn't seem to trust us all[n]that much yet.

[msg MSG_030 [Hikari]]
......

[msg MSG_031 [Morgana]]
Sheesh, I was TRYING to make us look[n]good... You could've just played along!

[msg MSG_032 [Hikari]]
......

[msg MSG_033 [Morgana]]
No comment, huh? Looks like we gotta try[n]harder next time.

[msg MSG_034 [Nagi]]
On another note, about that movie...
The ending that you sent the movie[n]towards may very well have been how it[n]was supposed to end.

[msg MSG_035 [Yusuke]]
How it was supposed to end...

[msg MSG_036 [Nagi]]
Don't you think so as well, Hikari-san?

[msg MSG_037 [Hikari]]
...Huh?

[msg MSG_038 [Nagi]]
The movie that played here before was[n]about a world where someone in power[n]ruled as if everything belonged to them.
That may be one way of living―[n]however...
I suspect that the edited movie conveyed[n]a different message.

[msg MSG_039 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I wonder what that could be...

[msg MSG_040 [Nagi]]
Those with power cannot err in how to[n]use that power.
Using it to save the weak and punish[n]evil―that is how a true hero should[n]behave...
Perhaps, that was the movie's true[n]point?

[msg MSG_041 [Hikari]]
I―About the movie...
The way I saw it... was completely[n]different.

[msg MSG_042 [Ann]]
What kind of story did you think it was?

[msg MSG_043 [Hikari]]
If you stand up to whoever's in[n]charge... you'll get singled out for[n]disturbing the peace...
And, the people around you... will look[n]down on you as weird...

[msg MSG_043_5 [Hikari]]
When the majority thinks it's right,[n]then it's just easier to go with the[n]flow...
That's why... I thought the movie was[n]going to end with everyone just doing[n]what they were told.

[sel SEL_044 top]
That's messed up.
That would be the worst movie.

[msg MSG_045 [Akechi]]
It's true that such a thing happens in[n]reality from time to time.

[msg MSG_046 [Ann]]
I'd never want something like that to be[n]the case...

[msg MSG_046_5 [Ann]]
And, it's not just about me―I can't obey[n]someone if it means abandoning my[n]companions and friends.

[msg MSG_047 [Ryuji]]
Yeah, kissing some big-wig's ass may[n]make it easier to get through life...
But, can you be proud of yourself for[n]that? I wouldn't be able to take it.

[msg MSG_048 [Futaba]]
S-So... What about you, Hikari?
I think companions and friends that help[n]you out are... really important.

[msg MSG_049 [Hikari]]
......

[msg MSG_050 [Futaba]]
Hikari?

[msg MSG_051 [Hikari]]
...I don't know.
My heart... feels like it's all twisted[n]up right now...

[msg MSG_052 [Nagi]]
Hikari-san...

[msg MSG_053 [Doe]]
......

[msg MSG_054 [Ryuji]]
Whoa!!!

[msg MSG_055 [Hikari]]
......!

[msg MSG_056 [Ann]]
Doe!?

[msg MSG_057 [Makoto]]
Wh-What is that, a doll!?

[msg MSG_058 [Haru]]
Oh, is that the projectionist you told[n]us about―the one playing the movie?

[msg MSG_059 [Hikari]]
......

[msg MSG_060 [Nagi]]
...Hikari-san, come here.

[msg MSG_061 [Akechi]]
Maybe he's upset because we changed the[n]movie without permission.

[msg MSG_062 [Morgana]]
Wait... Doesn't something seem off?

[msg MSG_0000 [Doe]]
Ngh... Nnnnnnnghhhhh!

[msg MSG_0001 [Ryuji]]
Dude, what the hell!?

[msg MSG_0002 [Morgana]]
Everyone, be careful!

[msg MSG_0003 [Hikari]]
Eek!

[msg MSG_0004 [Nagi]]
Hikari-san!

[msg MSG_0005 [Doe]]
Nggh... Gggghhhhhh!

[msg MSG_0006 [Ann]]
Huh? Is he... in pain?

[msg MSG_0007 [Akechi]]
Don't tell me he's going to attack us...[n]We won't be able to put up a fight here!

[msg MSG_0008 [Doe]]
Gggggghhhh...

[msg MSG_0009 [Makoto]]
What are we going to do, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]!?

[sel SEL_0010 top]
Let's see what happens.
Everyone, be on your guard.
Get ready to book it.

[msg MSG_0011 [Doe]]
Nnnghhhhhhh!

[msg MSG_0012 [Futaba]]
Oh no, oh no...

[msg MSG_0013 [Doe]]
Nnnghhhhhhh!

[msg MSG_0014 [Yusuke]]
Can we even fight this!?

[msg MSG_0015 [Doe]]
Nnnghhhhhhh!

[msg MSG_0016 [Futaba]]
B-But, run where!?

[msg MSG_0017 [Hikari]]
Ah... Nnh...

[msg MSG_0018 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hikari-chan? Are you okay!?

[msg MSG_0019 [Futaba]]
C-Calm down... W-We're here with you!

[msg MSG_0020 [Doe]]
Gggggghhhhhhhhh! Gggggghhhhhhhh!

[msg MSG_0021 [Ann]]
H-Hey, is he about to explode!?

[msg MSG_0022 [Doe]]
Ggggghhhh... Nnnghh... Ngh―

[msg MSG_0023 [Doe]]
......

[msg MSG_0024 [Haru]]
Is he... okay now?

[msg MSG_0025 [Yusuke]]
Hey, look―Doe dropped something.

[msg MSG_0026 [Morgana]]
Hrmm? That's...

[msg MSG_0027 [Ann]]
It's... a key?

[msg MSG_0028 [Yusuke]]
Indeed. Did he have it all this time?

[msg MSG_0029 [Akechi]]
Doe, what is this key for?

[msg MSG_0030 [Doe]]
......

[msg MSG_0031 [Ryuji]]
Hey, Doe! Answer us, asshole!

[msg MSG_0032 [Doe]]
......

[msg MSG_0033 [Futaba]]
Well, there he goes―it's not like he's[n]answered any of our questions to begin[n]with.

[msg MSG_0034 [Nagi]]
Hikari-san, it's all okay now.

[msg MSG_0035 [Hikari]]
......

[msg MSG_0036 [Futaba]]
Hey―is that key for the chains on the[n]exit?

[msg MSG_0037 [Morgana]]
Now that you mention it, it feels like[n]this key and one of the locks on the[n]exit would be a match.

[msg MSG_0038 [Haru]]
But, is it safe for us to use it? What[n]if it explodes when we touch it?

[msg MSG_0039 [Elizabeth]]
And that doesn't make you want to try[n]it?

[msg MSG_0040 [Haru]]
Wah! Who're they!?

[msg MSG_0041 [Futaba]]
Well, the TL;DR version is: they're the[n]Blue Brigade.

[msg MSG_0042 [Makoto]]
Ah, you're right, they're quite blue―
Wait, what―Why is he popcorn!?

[msg MSG_0043 [Theodore]]
Ah, does this costume pique your[n]curiosity? I was ordered to wear it as[n]part of the "grand opening" ritual, so―

[msg MSG_0044 [Elizabeth]]
NOW, which will it be?
Will you test the key... or will you[n]not? So, what's your decision!?

[sel SEL_0045 top]
Let's try it out.
It's awfully suspicious...
It could be a trap.

[msg MSG_0046 [Yusuke]]
I agree. If we don't try, we won't make[n]any progress.

[msg MSG_0047 [Ann]]
I mean, it came out of his body... I'm[n]kinda freaked out too.

[msg MSG_0048 [Yusuke]]
But, we have nothing else to go on. I[n]believe it's worth testing.

[msg MSG_0049 [Ryuji]]
But, there's nothing else we can try.[n]We're trapped here.

[msg MSG_0050 [Yusuke]]
Well then, let us test it at once.

[msg MSG_0051 [Elizabeth]]
If a decision has been reached, then let[n]us vamoose.

[msg MSG_0052 [Makoto]]
Hey―just who are those people in the[n]blue clothes?

[msg MSG_0053 [Ryuji]]
We don't have a clue―but I'll try to[n]fill you in anyways on the way there.
