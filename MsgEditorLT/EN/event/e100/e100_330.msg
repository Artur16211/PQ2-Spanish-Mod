[msg MSG_000 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Grrr, I just can't hold back anymore...[n]I'm too curious!

[msg MSG_001 [Ann]]
What's the matter? Feel free to ask me[n]whatever you'd like...

[msg MSG_002 [Morgana]]
Wha-Whatever!? No, don't―!!!

[msg MSG_003 [Yusuke]]
Do you really mean it―whatever we like!?

[msg MSG_004 [Ann]]
Geez, what is wrong with you two? Just[n]ignore them―you go right ahead.

[msg MSG_005 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Then, I'll just come out and say it...
How did you guys pick your outfits?[n]They're all so... unique!

[msg MSG_006 [Ann]]
Huh? Uhh... Well, it's like... Hm, how[n]DOES it work?

[msg MSG_007 [Yusuke]]
It's difficult for us to answer when you[n]phrase it that way...
Our attire is merely the outcome of[n]certain events, not something we chose[n]ourselves.

[msg MSG_008 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Really? So, you guys don't like how they[n]look?

[sel SEL_009 top]
Well, I like mine, at least.
I've just learned to live with it.

[msg MSG_010 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Good, so it's not an issue. I think you[n]all look so cool in them!

[msg MSG_011 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I see... But, I think you all look[n]really cool in them.

[msg MSG_012 [P3 Fem Protag]]
So, how do you transform? Is it like how[n]magical girls do it?

[msg MSG_013 [Ryuji]]
Uh, we don't really know. I guess it's,[n]well... Y'know, it's like...
...Pass. You explain it, Fox.

[msg MSG_014 [Yusuke]]
"Pass"? I see... So that's allowed here.
In that case, I shall pass as well,[n]leaving it for Panther.

[msg MSG_015 [Ann]]
Oh c'mon, why'd you stick me with it!?
Um, ummm... I'm passing too! Joker!

[sel SEL_016 top]
I'm passing three.
It's not my job to explain things.

[msg MSG_017 [Morgana]]
*sigh* Good grief... I'LL explain it for[n]you.
This attire represents our will of[n]rebellion―our desire to defy the[n]distorted world.

[msg MSG_017_5 [Morgana]]
Basically... depending on the[n]circumstances, the phantom thief attire[n]just designs itself!

[msg MSG_018 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Whoa, I see! ...Actually, I don't get it[n]at all!

[msg MSG_019 [Ryuji]]
Well, it's not like we actually get it,[n]either.

[msg MSG_020 [Ann]]
So, uh... are we really dressed all that[n]strangely?
I'm used to it by now. But it was really[n]embarrassing at first, and it gave me a[n]lot of grief...

[msg MSG_021 [P3 Fem Protag]]
No, they're great! They're perfect for[n]the whole phantom thief thing! I wish I[n]could disguise myself too...

[msg MSG_022 [Morgana]]
*chuckle* That's just part of the[n]phantom thief charm! I totally get what[n]you mean.

[msg MSG_023 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Uh-huh, so what about you, Mona?
What's it like inside your cat costume?[n]Can I try taking the head off?

[msg MSG_024 [Morgana]]
My head doesn't come off! This isn't a[n]costume!

[msg MSG_025 [P3 Fem Protag]]
O-Oh, I see... I mean, obviously I[n]thought you were a―

[msg MSG_026 [Morgana]]
I am NOT a cat, either! I'm obviously[n]HUMAN!

[msg MSG_027 [Ryuji]]
This conversation is music to my ears...

[msg MSG_028 [Ann]]
That reminds me―there's something I've[n]been curious about for a while,-chan!
Why, um... Why do you put a gun to your[n]head whenever you summon a Persona?

[msg MSG_029 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Oh yeah, you guys don't use these, do[n]you?
All the members of SEES have these[n]gun-shaped devices we call Evokers.
We summon our Personas by willing[n]ourselves to pull the Evoker's trigger[n]while pointed at our own heads.

[msg MSG_030 [Ryuji]]
Daaamn... You've gotta be, like, REALLY[n]determined to summon a Persona!

[msg MSG_031 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Whether it's your outfits or my Evoker,[n]there seem to be a few different ways to[n]summon. That's pretty cool!

[msg MSG_032 [Yusuke]]
Hm, perhaps I should inject some flair[n]into my own Persona summoning... For[n]example...

[msg MSG_033 [Yusuke]]
I could become a tableaux of complex[n]emotion! Like―sorrowful, yet ferocious!

[msg MSG_034 [Ann]]
Yeah, yeah, sounds great―can we get[n]going now? We have no idea how long this[n]movie is.

[msg MSG_035 [Morgana]]
*sigh* That's a good point... Let's go.
