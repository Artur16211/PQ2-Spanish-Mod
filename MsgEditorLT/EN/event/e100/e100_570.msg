[msg MSG_000 [Hikari]]
......!

[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
Sweet, it unlocked!

[msg MSG_002 [Nagi]]
To think, it would truly work!

[msg MSG_003 [Morgana]]
Heheh! You see―just as we suspected!

[msg MSG_004 [Makoto]]
So, does that mean our captor is that[n]being you call Doe, since he had the[n]key?

[msg MSG_005 [Akechi]]
We don't know if he's acting alone or[n]not, but there's no mistake that he's[n]involved in some way.

[msg MSG_006 [Ann]]
But then, why would he present us with[n]the key?
He looked like he was in pain, too...[n]I'm totally lost here.

[msg MSG_007 [Ryuji]]
Y'know, if he has the keys, couldn't we[n]just force him to spit out the rest of[n]'em?
Like, why don't we corner Doe and just[n]be all, "Give us the keys... or else!"

[sel SEL_008 top]
That seems dangerous...
Let's give it a shot.
Good luck with that, Ryuji.

[msg MSG_009 [Ann]]
I think so too. Wouldn't it be smarter[n]to not provoke him?

[msg MSG_010 [Futaba]]
だゅゅ ろめぺろ "ねょむめめめ" ほゎれもょまれれ ゐぺれ ぼるままらをデ ろよよテテテ[n]と みままゅ ゅもやま めま'ゅゅ ほゅよゐ ゎら もみ ゐま らもれれ めもゆ よみみテ[n]びめまょデ もろ'れ むぺゆま よわまる みよる ゎれテ

[msg MSG_011 [Ann]]
Hold on, there! Wouldn't it be smarter[n]to not provoke him?

[msg MSG_012 [Futaba]]
Yeah, he might go, "Nnghhh," and[n]explode... That'd be game over for us.

[msg MSG_013 [Ryuji]]
You're gonna make me do it alone!?

[msg MSG_014 [Ann]]
You better not do anything stupid,[n]Ryuji.
It definitely seems dangerous to anger[n]something we don't really understand.

[msg MSG_015 [Futaba]]
Yeah, he might go, "Nnghhh," and[n]explode... That'd be game over for us.

[msg MSG_016 [Ryuji]]
So what're we supposed to do about the[n]other three locks, then?

[msg MSG_017 [Makoto]]
This is entirely conjecture on my[n]part...
But, if changing the movie's ending led[n]to Doe producing a key...
Perhaps we only need to change three[n]more movies? I mean, it seems to follow.

[msg MSG_018 [Haru]]
Are there any other movies being shown[n]in the theater?

[msg MSG_019 [Nagi]]
There are three other ones, but they've[n]not been viewable since the anomaly[n]struck...

[msg MSG_020 [Makoto]]
Well, the numbers seem to match up, at[n]least.
What a conundrum this is. If only we had[n]more intel...

[msg MSG_021 [Hikari]]
......

[msg MSG_022 [Futaba]]
...Hikari? What's wrong?

[msg MSG_023 [Hikari]]
...Huh?

[msg MSG_024 [Futaba]]
Oh―um, well... You looked like you[n]wanted to say something...

[msg MSG_025 [Hikari]]
......
Um... Here... I don't know if this is a[n]clue or not, but...
I've had this with me ever since I woke[n]up here...

[msg MSG_026 [Futaba]]
Hm―what's this? Is it like the notebook[n]you gave us earlier?

[msg MSG_027 [Nagi]]
An invitation...

[msg MSG_028 [Futaba]]
"Please come see the movie, no matter[n]what..."?

[msg MSG_028_5 [Futaba]]
W-Wait, what!? Is that letter supposed[n]to be a threat?

[msg MSG_029 [Ryuji]]
That means Hikari was brought here by[n]someone―or at least asked to come here!
Maybe it really is that Doe guy after[n]all!

[msg MSG_030 [Hikari]]
I-I don't know... I don't know[n]anything... I'm so scared...

[msg MSG_031 [P3 Fem Protag]]
You've been alone ever since you awoke―I[n]can understand why you feel uneasy...
But, don't worry! You've got Nagi-san[n]and us with you now.

[msg MSG_032 [Haru]]
She's right. Let's work together and[n]we'll all leave this place, okay?

[msg MSG_033 [Hikari]]
...A-Ah!

[msg MSG_034 [Futaba]]
Wh-What's wrong!? Did you remember[n]something!?

[msg MSG_035 [Hikari]]
There's a movie... that I need to watch[n]here...

[msg MSG_036 [Yusuke]]
Hm!?

[msg MSG_037 [Theater intercom]]
We have an announcement for our[n]customers.
A new movie will begin showing in[n]Theater 2 momentarily. I repeat...

[msg MSG_038 [Morgana]]
A new movie―just as we're talking about[n]it? Should we check it out?

[msg MSG_039 [Ann]]
Yeah! Uh, the announcement said Theater[n]2, right?

[msg MSG_040 [Nagi]]
Allow me to guide you there, then.[n]Please, follow me.

[msg MSG_041]
Nagi walked off in the direction of the[n]theaters...
We should head over to Theater 2...
