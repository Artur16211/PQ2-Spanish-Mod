[msg MSG_000 [Ryuji]]
What is it, Morgana!? You find some[n]kinda clue?

[msg MSG_001 [Morgana]]
Take a look at this door.

[msg MSG_002 [Ann]]
What about it?

[msg MSG_003 [Morgana]]
This door...

[msg MSG_004 [Ann]]
So it's no use?

[msg MSG_005]
This appears to be the exit, but there[n]are multiple thick chains on the door...
The chains are held on with four[n]different padlocks...

[msg MSG_006 [Ryuji]]
The hell is this!?

[msg MSG_007 [Yusuke]]
Such redundant security...

[msg MSG_008 [Ann]]
Wait, doesn't this mean we're trapped in[n]here!?

[msg MSG_009 [Futaba]]
Abduction and confinement confirmed!

[msg MSG_010 [Ryuji]]
Hey, Morgana! Can't you pick them open?

[msg MSG_011 [Morgana]]
I gave it a shot, but it was useless.[n]The keyholes aren't shaped for any[n]ordinary keys.

[msg MSG_011_5 [Morgana]]
If we did something about them, I bet we[n]could get out of here...

[msg MSG_012 [Ann]]
Yeah... Hey, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0], isn't there[n]anything we can do?

[sel SEL_013 top]
Let's force it open.
This is hopeless.
Could we even find the keys?

[msg MSG_014 [Ryuji]]
*gasp* *pant* Dammit... this sucks![n]Won't budge... one bit!

[msg MSG_015 [Yusuke]]
Hm, so brute force won't work. Could we[n]perhaps look for the keys?

[msg MSG_016 [Ann]]
You're giving up already!?

[msg MSG_017 [Yusuke]]
Accepting defeat with grace can be[n]admirable, but let's not do that just[n]yet. Shall we find the keys?

[msg MSG_018 [Morgana]]
I already looked, but couldn't find[n]them, or anything else―not even a[n]mouse...

[msg MSG_019 [Morgana]]
While we're at it, how'd it go on your[n]end? Any sign of Makoto or Haru?

[msg MSG_020 [Futaba]]
Not at all. We looked everywhere, too...

[msg MSG_021 [Ryuji]]
We didn't see a single clue.

[msg MSG_022 [Akechi]]
Since the exit's chained up, it's[n]doubtful they made it outside. What to[n]do...?

[msg MSG_023 [Ann]]
Hey, why don't we try heading back to[n]where we first woke up?
Maybe they've turned up there since we[n]started poking around out here.

[msg MSG_024 [Morgana]]
Yeah, Lady Ann has a point―and there's[n]no use worrying about it out here...
All right, let's head back!
