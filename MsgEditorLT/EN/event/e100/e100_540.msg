[msg MSG_000 [Doe]]
Ngh... Nnnnnnnghhhhh!

[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
Dude, what the hell!?

[msg MSG_002 [Morgana]]
Everyone, be careful!

[msg MSG_003 [Hikari]]
Eek!

[msg MSG_004 [Nagi]]
Hikari-san!

[msg MSG_005 [Doe]]
Nggh... Gggghhhhhh!

[msg MSG_006 [Ann]]
Huh? Is he... in pain?

[msg MSG_007 [Akechi]]
Don't tell me he's going to attack us...[n]We won't be able to put up a fight here!

[msg MSG_008 [Doe]]
Gggggghhhh...

[msg MSG_009 [Makoto]]
What are we going to do, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]!?

[sel SEL_010 top]
Let's see what happens.
Everyone, be on your guard.
Get ready to book it.

[msg MSG_011 [Doe]]
Nnnghhhhhhh!

[msg MSG_012 [Futaba]]
Oh no, oh no...

[msg MSG_013 [Doe]]
Nnnghhhhhhh!

[msg MSG_014 [Yusuke]]
Can we even fight this!?

[msg MSG_015 [Doe]]
Nnnghhhhhhh!

[msg MSG_016 [Futaba]]
B-But, run where!?

[msg MSG_017 [Hikari]]
Ah... Nnh...

[msg MSG_018 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hikari-chan? Are you okay!?

[msg MSG_019 [Futaba]]
C-Calm down... W-We're here with you!

[msg MSG_020 [Doe]]
Gggggghhhhhhhhh! Gggggghhhhhhhh!

[msg MSG_021 [Ann]]
H-Hey, is he about to explode!?

[msg MSG_022 [Doe]]
Ggggghhhh... Nnnghh... Ngh―

[msg MSG_023 [Doe]]
......

[msg MSG_024 [Haru]]
Is he... okay now?

[msg MSG_025 [Yusuke]]
Hey, look―Doe dropped something.

[msg MSG_026 [Morgana]]
Hrmm? That's...

[msg MSG_027 [Ann]]
It's... a key?

[msg MSG_028 [Yusuke]]
Indeed. Did he have it all this time?

[msg MSG_029 [Akechi]]
Doe, what is this key for?

[msg MSG_030 [Doe]]
......

[msg MSG_031 [Ryuji]]
Hey, Doe! Answer us, asshole!

[msg MSG_032 [Doe]]
......

[msg MSG_033 [Futaba]]
Well, there he goes―it's not like he's[n]answered any of our questions to begin[n]with.

[msg MSG_034 [Nagi]]
Yes, we've failed to make any form of[n]contact with Doe...
Hikari-san, it's all okay now.

[msg MSG_035 [Hikari]]
......

[msg MSG_036 [Futaba]]
Hey―is that key for the chains on the[n]exit?

[msg MSG_037 [Morgana]]
Now that you mention it, it feels like[n]this key and one of the locks on the[n]exit would be a match.

[msg MSG_038 [Haru]]
But, is it safe for us to use it? What[n]if it explodes when we touch it?

[msg MSG_039 [Elizabeth]]
And that doesn't make you want to try[n]it?

[msg MSG_040 [Haru]]
Wah! Who're they!?

[msg MSG_041 [Futaba]]
Well, the TL;DR version is: they're the[n]Blue Brigade.

[msg MSG_042 [Makoto]]
Ah, you're right, they're quite blue―
Wait, what―Why is he popcorn!?

[msg MSG_043 [Theodore]]
Ah, does this costume pique your[n]curiosity? I was ordered to wear it as[n]part of the "grand opening" ritual, so―

[msg MSG_044 [Elizabeth]]
NOW, which will it be?
Will you test the key... or will you[n]not? So, what's your decision!?

[sel SEL_045 top]
Let's try it out.
It's awfully suspicious...
It could be a trap.

[msg MSG_046 [Yusuke]]
I agree. If we don't try, we won't make[n]any progress.

[msg MSG_047 [Ann]]
I mean, it came out of his body... I'm[n]kinda freaked out too.

[msg MSG_048 [Yusuke]]
But, we have nothing else to go on. I[n]believe it's worth testing.

[msg MSG_049 [Ryuji]]
But, there's nothing else we can try.[n]We're trapped here.

[msg MSG_050 [Yusuke]]
Well then, let us test it at once.

[msg MSG_051 [Elizabeth]]
If a decision has been reached, then let[n]us vamoose.

[msg MSG_052 [Makoto]]
Hey―just who are those people in the[n]blue clothes?

[msg MSG_053 [Ryuji]]
We don't have a clue―but I'll try to[n]fill you in anyways on the way there.
