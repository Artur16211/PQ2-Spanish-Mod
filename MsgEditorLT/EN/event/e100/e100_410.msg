[msg MSG_000 [Morgana]]
Let's get right to our strategy meeting[n]on how we'll steal the Kamoshidaman[n]statue.

[msg MSG_001 [P3 Fem Protag]]
The phrase "strategy meeting" sounds so[n]cool... It just screams "phantom[n]thieves"!

[msg MSG_002 [Ann]]
Haha, looks like she's on the same[n]wavelength as us.

[msg MSG_003 [Morgana]]
Thanks to [f 6 1 27 0 0 0], we've secured our[n]route to the switchboard.

[msg MSG_004 [Futaba]]
Now we can turn off the statue's lights[n]whenever we want.

[msg MSG_005 [Ann]]
Stealing a statue under the cover of[n]darkness...
We've pulled off a similar heist in the[n]past... I think we can manage this time[n]around too.

[msg MSG_006 [Morgana]]
The question is, how do we physically[n]take the statue?

[msg MSG_007 [Akechi]]
Even though it seems to be lighter than[n]it looks, escaping with it by hand may[n]be too difficult...

[msg MSG_008 [Ann]]
How to swipe the statue... Hey, got any[n]ideas?

[sel SEL_009 top]
We could hoist it with a crane.
Someone'll act as a diversion.
Nothing comes to mind.

[msg MSG_010 [P3 Fem Protag]]
That makes me think of the crane game![n]Sounds fun.

[msg MSG_011 [Futaba]]
But there wasn't enough space there for[n]such a large-scale scheme.

[msg MSG_012 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hmm―it sounded good to me. Like, we'd[n]just swoop down from above and pluck it[n]from the square...

[msg MSG_013 [Morgana]]
A diversionary tactic, huh... That's not[n]bad, but...

[msg MSG_014 [Ryuji]]
Should we dangle Morgana from the end of[n]a fishing pole?

[msg MSG_015 [Morgana]]
I'm not some kind of bait!
I mean―there's a chance that the bait[n]could be captured and end up with Makoto[n]and Haru!

[msg MSG_016 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Oh, that's a good point. I wish we could[n]just swoop down and snatch it up before[n]getting caught...

[msg MSG_017 [P3 Fem Protag]]
*sigh* If only we had superpowers like[n]Kamoshidaman...

[msg MSG_018 [Futaba]]
We could just swoop down from the sky[n]with a "HAHAHA!" and make like a tree[n]with the statue...

[msg MSG_019 [Akechi]]
This operation would be quite easy if[n]that were possible.

[msg MSG_020 [Ann]]
Wait, I think that'd work!

[msg MSG_021 [Ryuji]]
What'd work?

[msg MSG_022 [Ann]]
Stealing it from the sky!

[msg MSG_023 [Yusuke]]
It seems you've been struck with[n]inspiration. Would you tell us more?

[msg MSG_024 [Ann]]
Sure―so, this'll take some help from[n]everyone, starting with Yusuke...

[msg MSG_025 [Yusuke]]
Hm, I see. So we're going to take those[n]and put them here...

[msg MSG_026 [P3 Fem Protag]]
That sounds like a great plan!

[msg MSG_027 [Ann]]
Right? Right!?

[msg MSG_028 [Morgana]]
Now that's our Lady Ann! But, it all[n]comes down to this question: Yusuke, can[n]you pull it off?

[msg MSG_029 [Yusuke]]
Undoubtedly. I'll make quite the[n]breathtaking prop.

[msg MSG_030 [Ryuji]]
Kickass! Let's go get the stuff we need!

[msg MSG_031 [Ann]]
Ryuji and I'll head over to Theodore's[n]spot.
We'll need tons of stuff, so he's gotta[n]be the one to do this for us!

[msg MSG_032 [Ryuji]]
Yeah. We'll make sure he sets us up[n]right!

[msg MSG_033 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Yusuke-kun and I'll go borrow the[n]supplies we need from Nagi-san and get[n]to work.
Most of it'll be on Yusuke-kun, but I'll[n]do whatever he needs to get it done!

[msg MSG_034 [Yusuke]]
And I vow to craft the perfect item.[n]Using my skills for such a task... I'm[n]itching to do this.

[msg MSG_035 [Futaba]]
Hey... Can I go talk to Hikari for a[n]bit?

[sel SEL_036 top]
Did something happen?
Are you concerned?

[msg MSG_037 [Futaba]]
Nothing like that... I just wanna talk[n]to her some more.

[msg MSG_038 [Futaba]]
Yeah... I want to talk to her some more.

[msg MSG_039 [Morgana]]
Then, I'll go with you...
If Futaba goes alone, she may not even[n]end up saying what's actually on her[n]mind.

[msg MSG_040 [Futaba]]
Mona... That would help!

[msg MSG_041 [Akechi]]
...Would it be acceptable for me to go[n]where Elizabeth is too?

[msg MSG_042 [Ann]]
Elizabeth?

[msg MSG_043 [Akechi]]
Sorry, there's just something that I[n]wish to ask her... I apologize for the[n]personal reason.

[msg MSG_044 [Morgana]]
Well, I'm sure it'll be fine since we've[n]got everything else covered.
, you keep tabs on everyone's progress[n]until all the preparations are done.
It's for the best not to leave everyone[n]to their own devices. Make sure[n]everything gets taken care of!

[msg MSG_045]
Everyone left on their missions...
Who should I check on?

[sel SEL_046 top]
and Yusuke
Ann and Ryuji
Morgana and Futaba
Akechi and Elizabeth
