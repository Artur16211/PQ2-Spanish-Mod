When the harmony of the city is[n]disturbed...

[msg MSG_000_1]
An absolute hero appears!

[msg MSG_001]
KAMOSHIDAMAN

[msg MSG_002]
Astoundingly powerful and wholly[n]invincible!

[msg MSG_003]
Kamoshidaman is justice incarnate, and[n]justice itself is Kamoshidaman!

[msg MSG_004]
This is a perfect society: justice[n]rules, and must be obeyed by all...

[msg MSG_005]
However, a wicked miscreant voices[n]discontent for our shining salvation!

[msg MSG_006]
What an ingrate!

[msg MSG_006_1]
Defying the hero of justice is[n]unforgivable!

[msg MSG_007]
Can Kamoshidaman defeat the evil that[n]opposes righteousness?

[msg MSG_008]
The absolute hero: Kamoshidaman!

[msg MSG_009]
Now playing!

[msg MSG_010]
