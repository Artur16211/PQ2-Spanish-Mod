Everyone gathered in the lobby after[n]wrapping up their preparations...

[msg MSG_001 [Morgana]]
Is everyone ready?

[msg MSG_002 [Ryuji]]
Yeah, totally!

[msg MSG_003 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Perfect on our end, too!

[msg MSG_004 [Morgana]]
, how about your own preparations?
Once we head out, we won't be able to[n]return here for a while. If you need to[n]take care of anything, now's the time.

[sel SEL_005 top]
I need some time to prepare.
Let's start the mission.

[msg MSG_006 [Morgana]]
Mmhm, it's best to be fully prepared.[n]Better safe than sorry!

Once we're ready, let's head to[n]Kamoshida Square!

[msg MSG_008 [P3 Fem Protag]]
This mission has to be a success, no[n]matter what!

[msg MSG_009 [Morgana]]
Yes, it's time to gracefully steal the[n]Kamoshidaman statue and rescue our[n]teammates!
