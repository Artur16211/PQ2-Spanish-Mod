[msg MSG_000]
Could this be... the Velvet Room?

[msg MSG_001 [Yusuke]]
What a curiously blue room... It has a[n]certain coziness to it.

[msg MSG_003 [Akechi]]
Could this room's appearance also be[n]attributed to the anomaly?

[msg MSG_004 [Ann]]
Hey, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0], introduce us to them.

[msg MSG_005 [Justine]]
Likewise―and tell us about this movie[n]theater we're trapped in as well.

[msg MSG_006]
I should tell them what we know so[n]far...

[msg MSG_008 [Caroline]]
I see... You're not lying to us, are[n]you?

[msg MSG_009 [Ryuji]]
Either way, now we understand the whole[n]Velvet Room thing, with the little[n]warden twins...

[msg MSG_010 [Justine]]
Inmate, you're telling us that there's[n]essentially no way out of here?

[sel SEL_011 top]
That's right.
Unfortunately...

[msg MSG_012 [Justine]]
To think that we wardens would become[n]prisoners...

[msg MSG_013 [Caroline]]
Justine, there's no point in us[n]obsessing over this. Let's simply call[n]it a part of his rehabilitation.

[msg MSG_014 [Justine]]
Indeed, it'd be best to accept the[n]situation as such for now.
Fortunately, this is a Velvet Room...

[msg MSG_015 [Justine]]
Give thanks, Inmate: we shall take on[n]the task of fusing Personas here.

[sel SEL_016 top]
That would be great.
Wow! You can do that?

[msg MSG_017 [Caroline]]
You'd better be grateful.

[msg MSG_018 [Justine]]
What nonsense...

[msg MSG_019 [Caroline]]
Keep up this impudence and we'll be[n]executing YOU instead!

[msg MSG_020 [Justine]]
Still, you will need to wait for a while[n]longer, until our preparations are[n]complete.
It seems we are a bit out of our element[n]here.

[msg MSG_021 [Caroline]]
You've been freely able to wield[n]countless Personas, yes, Inmate?

[msg MSG_022 [Justine]]
We refer to that ability as the "power[n]of the wild card."
However, that power seems to have been[n]altered here...

[sel SEL_023 top]
What do you mean?
I saw that one coming...

[msg MSG_024 [Caroline]]
Simply put, you can't take "Arsene" off.

[msg MSG_025]
It seems that I can't change my[n]Personas...

[msg MSG_025_5 [Nagi]]
Everyone, are you all safe―

[msg MSG_026 [Nagi]]
My! I recall this room as being the test[n]screening room...

[msg MSG_027 [Caroline]]
Who's that?

[msg MSG_028 [Nagi]]
Ah... Pardon us, please. We grew too[n]concerned for you all...

[msg MSG_029 [Hikari]]
...Twins?

[msg MSG_030 [Justine]]
We were informed about you two earlier.[n]There's no need to trouble yourselves[n]with us.

[msg MSG_031 [Nagi]]
U-Umm...

[msg MSG_032 [Ann]]
Hmm. Looks like we're gonna have to do[n]some more introductions and catching[n]up...

[msg MSG_033 [Nagi]]
I see... So much is happening, all so[n]quickly.
If it will help aid in our escape, then[n]please, use this facility as you deem[n]necessary.

[msg MSG_034 [Hikari]]
Are you two... their friends as well?

[msg MSG_035 [Justine]]
The word "friend" is wholly unsuitable[n]for us.

[msg MSG_036 [Caroline]]
We are in charge of his rehabilitation.

[msg MSG_037 [Hikari]]
......?

[msg MSG_038 [Justine]]
Well then, Inmate―continue dedicating[n]yourself to your rehabilitation here.
This inability to manifest your power of[n]the wild card should be considered a[n]test.

[msg MSG_039 [Ann]]
So he can't change Personas... It's a[n]real setback, but I guess we'll just[n]have to deal with it.

[sel SEL_040 top]
I'm sure we'll manage.
I'll be relying on all of you.
That's troubling...

[msg MSG_041 [Morgana]]
That's right, there's no need to worry―[n]you can count on all of us, too!

[msg MSG_042 [Yusuke]]
Right, that's how it should be.

[msg MSG_043 [Ryuji]]
Don't sweat it! We've all been dealing[n]with only one each this entire time.[n]We'll manage somehow!

[msg MSG_044 [Caroline]]
Hm? Hold on, Inmate―what's that you have[n]there?

[msg MSG_045 [Justine]]
Hand over that shining object within[n]your pocket.

[msg MSG_046 [Yusuke]]
Shining object? Perhaps they're[n]referring to that bit of film you found?

[msg MSG_047]
I hand over the shining film...

[msg MSG_048 [Justine]]
This...

[msg MSG_049 [Ann]]
We just happened to find it. Do you know[n]what it is?

[msg MSG_050 [Caroline]]
This shining film―it holds infinite[n]possibilities within...

[msg MSG_051 [Justine]]
Those infinite possibilities that exist[n]within one's heart―in other words,[n]Personas.
With this, you should be able to take on[n]an additional Persona besides Arsene...

[msg MSG_052 [Futaba]]
Really, a second Persona? Does that mean[n]double the firepower!? That's so OP!

[msg MSG_053 [Justine]]
No, the second Persona that can be taken[n]on won't be the same strength as the[n]original.
If Arsene is the main Persona, any[n]others taken on are considered[n]Sub-Personas...
Think of it merely as an aid to the[n]original one.

[msg MSG_054 [Akechi]]
Still, two at the same time? Quite[n]impressive, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]. My hat's off to you.

[msg MSG_055 [Justine]]
Now, Inmate: look at this.

[msg MSG_056]
I peer into the shining film...

[msg MSG_056_05]
A "Pixie" emerged from the film!

[msg MSG_057]
The shining film transformed and you[n]acquired the Persona "Pixie."

[msg MSG_057_05 [Ryuji]]
I don't really get it, but damn! That[n]wild card thing is wicked!
You're so lucky, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]. I wish I could[n]double up on my Personas too.

[msg MSG_058 [Justine]]
...Caroline.

[msg MSG_059 [Caroline]]
Yes... So it would seem, Justine.

[msg MSG_060 [Ryuji]]
What's up?

[msg MSG_061 [Caroline]]
The rest of you are also now capable of[n]taking on a second Persona.

[msg MSG_062 [Ryuji]]
For real!? Not just [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]!?

[msg MSG_063 [Justine]]
Obviously, that would be the case in a[n]standard scenario...
But here, you may borrow and use the[n]Personas that take form in the[n]prisoner's heart.
Why that is, though... Could it be due[n]to the power of the wild card changing?

[sel SEL_064 top]
You don't know either?
How could it change?

[msg MSG_065 [Caroline]]
Watch your tongue, Inmate!
All you should be doing is making use of[n]that power―WITHOUT the attitude!

[msg MSG_066 [Justine]]
Yes, that is correct.
Even so, this feeling I have... It's as[n]if another with the power of the wild[n]card is here as well.

[msg MSG_067 [Justine]]
This feeling I have... It's as if[n]another with the power of the wild card[n]is here as well.

[msg MSG_068 [Caroline]]
Listen! You don't need to know what's[n]going on!
All you need to do is make use of that[n]power, and keep your mouth shut!

[msg MSG_069 [Yusuke]]
So what you're saying is, we can now[n]summon another Persona besides our usual[n]one.

[msg MSG_070 [Futaba]]
Oh man, I'm so psyched!

[msg MSG_071 [Ann]]
Main and Sub-Personas, huh... Will I be[n]able to handle using both of them?

[msg MSG_072 [Morgana]]
Well, we've got [f 6 1 30 0 0 0] to help with[n]that...
After all, he's our specialist in[n]wielding multiple Personas!
If anything, this'll broaden our[n]strategies, so there'll be even less for[n]us to fear, right?

[msg MSG_073 [Justine]]
While the situation is unusual, you are[n]still a prisoner. Do not neglect your[n]rehabilitation...
