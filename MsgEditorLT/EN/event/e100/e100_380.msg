[msg MSG_000 [Yusuke]]
Careful! There's a man standing guard up[n]ahead.

[msg MSG_001 [Morgana]]
Hmm, he doesn't seem to be guarding[n]anything in particular...
So, why's he standing there?

[msg MSG_002 [Ryuji]]
Maybe he's just slackin' off? He kinda[n]looks like the lazy type.

[msg MSG_003 [Morgana]]
Not everyone has the same goals as you,[n]Skull.

[msg MSG_004 [Ryuji]]
Hey!

[msg MSG_005 [Ann]]
Just forget it. Look! Isn't that an open[n]manhole behind him?

[msg MSG_006 [Ryuji]]
Huh? A manhole? Are they doin' sewer[n]repairs or somethin'?

[msg MSG_007 [Ann]]
No, no―doesn't it look like he's[n]guarding it? Sometimes stuff like power[n]lines are run underground.
Maybe the lights' power source is[n]somewhere on the other side of the[n]manhole.

[msg MSG_008 [Akechi]]
That would make sense. I doubt they'd[n]have someone stand guard somewhere[n]without good reason.

[msg MSG_009 [Yusuke]]
Hm... If it's a possibility, then why[n]not head into the sewers and check it[n]out?

[msg MSG_010 [Ryuji]]
Well, for that to happen, we gotta do[n]somethin' about that cop first... What's[n]your call, Joker?

[sel SEL_011 top]
Let's take him out.
We don't have a choice...
Let's talk it out with him.

[msg MSG_012 [Ryuji]]
Yeah! Sounds like the fastest way to get[n]this done.

[msg MSG_013 [Morgana]]
Right―this isn't someone we can just[n]convince to let us by.

[msg MSG_014 [Ryuji]]
Welp, let's get on with it and take real[n]good care of him!

[msg MSG_015 [Yusuke]]
I don't think that would work.
I doubt he'd let criminals in defiance[n]of Kamoshidaman through that easily.

[msg MSG_016 [Ryuji]]
Heh, guess it's time to bust out the[n]fists!

[msg MSG_017 [Yusuke]]
Wait―I'd like to propose an idea[n]first...
After taking him down, why don't we[n]avail ourselves of his uniform as well?

[msg MSG_018 [Ann]]
Strip the cop? Why?

[msg MSG_019 [Yusuke]]
If we're going to steal that statue, I[n]assume there will be even more guards[n]beyond this point...
So a police uniform may come in handy at[n]some stage of the operation.

[msg MSG_020 [Morgana]]
So, a disguise, eh? Not a bad idea―[n]although, I obviously won't be the one[n]wearing it...

[msg MSG_021 [Akechi]]
We're in our own phantom thief attire,[n]so we couldn't exactly don it all that[n]easily, either.
Which leaves us with...

[msg MSG_022 [Ann]]
...[f 6 1 27 0 0 0]-chan?

[msg MSG_023 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Huh? Me!? Impersonating a cop?
Ooh, that sounds so fun! Pick me, pick[n]me! Can I, Joker?

[sel SEL_024 top]
You're on the force.
If everyone else is fine with it.
But... I want to wear it...

[msg MSG_025 [Ann]]
You've already got your own outfit!

[msg MSG_026 [Yusuke]]
Let's just leave this to [f 6 1 26 0 0 0]-san.

[msg MSG_027 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Mmhm, count on me! Getting to wear a[n]disguise will really make me feel like a[n]top-notch thief!

[msg MSG_028 [Ann]]
Ahaha, you're really starting to think[n]like a phantom thief now,-chan!

[msg MSG_029 [P3 Fem Protag]]
*giggle* Well, I am a member of the[n]Phantom Thieves now―just leave it to me!

[msg MSG_030 [Futaba]]
Okay―now that that's decided, let's deal[n]with that cop! Ready, Joker?

[sel SEL_031 top]
Let's get this done.
Give me a second.

[msg MSG_032 [Policeman on guard]]
Ah―Suspicious characters! You're all[n]under arrest!
