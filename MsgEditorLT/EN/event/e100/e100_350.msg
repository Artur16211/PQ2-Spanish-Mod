[msg MSG_000 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Did we find Kamoshida Square?

[msg MSG_001 [Ann]]
I bet we did―check that out...

[msg MSG_002 [Ann]]
It just screams, "This is it"... as[n]tastelessly as possible.

[msg MSG_003 [Ryuji]]
Kamoshida's Palace was effin' gross, but[n]this is pretty far up there, too...

[msg MSG_004 [Yusuke]]
Blugh...!

[msg MSG_005 [Futaba]]
What's wrong!?

[msg MSG_006 [Yusuke]]
I-It's horrible... That statue is[n]utterly reprehensible!
No, even more than that―it's nothing[n]less than a sacrilege against beauty!

[sel SEL_007 top]
Seriously...
It's garbage.

[msg MSG_008 [Heroic voice?]]
YOU are the ones who are reprehensible!

[msg MSG_009 [Morgana]]
Wha―!?

[msg MSG_010 [Kamoshidaman]]
HAHAHA! Well done in making it this far,[n]evildoers of my Kamo City!

[msg MSG_011 [Ann]]
Queen! Noir!

[msg MSG_012 [Haru]]
Everyone!

[msg MSG_013 [Kamoshidaman]]
I shall now punish the trash of society[n]before me!

[msg MSG_014 [P3 Fem Protag]]
"Trash of society"!?

[msg MSG_015 [Kamoshidaman]]
HAHAHA! That's right!

[msg MSG_015_5 [Kamoshidaman]]
Not only do you disobey me, the head of[n]this city...
But you sow discord amongst the citizens[n]and bring only chaos to our peaceful[n]society.
How else should I refer to such trash?

[msg MSG_016 [Ryuji]]
You bastard―I don't buy one bit of this[n]self-centered shit you're spewing!

[msg MSG_017 [Kamoshidaman]]
Self-centered? I wouldn't be too[n]confident about that...

[msg MSG_018 [Brazen man]]
Those are the criminals, right?

[msg MSG_019 [Weary woman]]
If Kamoshidaman says so, then they have[n]to be...

[msg MSG_020 [Agitated man]]
If you say they're criminals, then take[n]'em down!

[msg MSG_021 [Ann]]
The people are supporting him...

[msg MSG_022 [Kamoshidaman]]
HAHAHA! That's right!
You may be criminals, but still, I must[n]praise you for not abandoning your[n]companions like cowards.

[msg MSG_022_5 [Kamoshidaman]]
However―you have defied me! You're[n]nothing but garbage, contaminating all[n]of society!
Such rebels will be punished through my[n]judgment!

[msg MSG_023 [Ryuji]]
What!? A power-hungry bastard like you[n]has no right to judge us!

[msg MSG_024 [Yusuke]]
All you do is suppress the citizens with[n]your authority... It's quite pathetic.

[msg MSG_025 [Ann]]
And the same goes for all the people in[n]this city that are blindly following[n]you, too!

[msg MSG_026 [Kamoshidaman]]
Hmph, it seems that this trash doesn't[n]even have the brains necessary to[n]comprehend their misdeeds.

[msg MSG_027 [Akechi]]
Oh dear, I don't think talking this[n]through is getting us anywhere. What[n]should we do now?

[sel SEL_028 top]
Use brute force on him.
Win over the citizens.
Save Queen and Noir.

[msg MSG_029 [Yusuke]]
Ha, no wasting time in that plan. It[n]would surely snap the citizens out of[n]their stupor.

[msg MSG_030 [Ann]]
Yeah, let's teach him a lesson and[n]rescue our friends!

[msg MSG_031 [Ryuji]]
Looks like we've gotta make him[n]understand like we did with Kamoshida...
I'm sure that'll get the people to snap[n]out of it, too.

[msg MSG_032 [Ann]]
Yeah! Let's take him down and save those[n]two!

[msg MSG_033 [Ryuji]]
Right, this is goin' nowhere. We gotta[n]take him down!

[msg MSG_034 [Yusuke]]
That should also bring the citizens to[n]their senses in due time.

[msg MSG_035 [Kamoshidaman]]
HAHAHA! I am invincible! I am justice![n]You simple children cannot defeat me!
