Be careful in there, guys. I'll start[n]navigating as hard as I can!

[msg MSG_001 [Ann]]
*sigh* This movie though―it's seriously[n]depressing, no matter where I look...
Who would even make something like this?

[msg MSG_002 [Ryuji]]
The plot's all effed up too. That[n]Kamoshida-wannabe gets treated like a[n]hero...
Plus, the enemies here ain’t the Shadows[n]we've seen before... Seriously, the[n]effin’ hell is goin’ on here?

[sel SEL_003 top]
Don't lose it on me here.
Enemies are still enemies.
All we have to do is beat them.

[msg MSG_004 [Ryuji]]
Ohh... Uh, sorry. Was I makin' you[n]nervous?
I haven’t forgotten about rescuin’ Queen[n]and Noir, though. I'm good.

[msg MSG_005 [Akechi]]
Yes, this is not an occasion for panic.[n]Let's all attempt to remain calm.
It’s true that there’s a lot we don’t[n]know about this world. However, what we[n]must do now is quite clear.

[msg MSG_006 [Ann]]
That’s true―all we have to do is take[n]out Shadows and accomplish our mission.
So it's really not any different from[n]what we do in Palaces...

[msg MSG_007 [Akechi]]

[msg MSG_008 [Ryuji]]
Dude... You sound like a real meathead[n]sometimes, y’know that?
Then again, I guess fighting's all we[n]can do right now. Ain’t like me to[n]complain about that.

[msg MSG_009 [Akechi]]
Yes, this is not an occasion for panic.[n]Let's all attempt to remain calm.
It’s true that there’s a lot we don’t[n]know about this world. However, what we[n]must do now is quite clear.

[msg MSG_010 [Morgana]]
Right. First we need to explore this[n]movie and find Kamoshidaman.
After all, we don't know if he’s gonna[n]harm Queen or Noir.

[msg MSG_011 [Ann]]
Yeah, seriously! He may or may not be[n]the real guy, but just looking like[n]Kamoshida's enough to worry me...

[msg MSG_012 [Yusuke]]
Let's go―we need to rescue them as soon[n]as possible.
