[msg MSG_000 [P3 Fem Protag]]
So we go in through the screen, right?[n]I'm getting kinda nervous...

[msg MSG_001 [Hikari]]
...You're going too?

[msg MSG_002 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hikari-chan?

[msg MSG_003 [Hikari]]
But, why? You're not even looking for[n]the same people...
If you go with them, you might not even[n]find who you're looking for...

[msg MSG_004 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Ahaha, you've got a point...
But, nothing's certain in this world,[n]and this problem isn't going to solve[n]itself.
When I thought about what I wanted to[n]do, I realized I wanted to go with them.[n]That's all there was to it.

[msg MSG_005 [Hikari]]
Because... they rescued you? To repay[n]them for what they did?

[msg MSG_006 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Well, of course there's that! But more[n]importantly, I understand their[n]situation too well.
...I have missing companions who are[n]important to me, too.

[msg MSG_007 [Hikari]]
Companions...

[msg MSG_008 [Akechi]]
Would your missing friends happen to be[n]Persona-users as well?

[msg MSG_009 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Yeah, everyone in SEES is! See this[n]armband? That stands for Specialized[n]Extracurricular Execution Squad.

[msg MSG_010 [Ryuji]]
Oh, that's cool―it's like proof that[n]you're all part of a team.

[msg MSG_011 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Heheh, right? Although, I'm the only[n]member here now...

[msg MSG_012 [Ann]]
Don't worry, we've got your back! Let's[n]do our best―together!

[msg MSG_013 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Ooh, I get to be part of the Phantom[n]Thieves until I find everyone!
Or, ah... is that fine with you?

[sel SEL_014 top]
That was our intention.
I don't think you should.
But, your outfit...

[msg MSG_015 [Ryuji]]
Yeah! I dunno why, but it feels like you[n]already fit in with us perfectly.

[msg MSG_016 [Futaba]]
Whoa, daaaamn... Her social skills are[n]seriously god-tier...

[msg MSG_017 [Morgana]]
Yeah, you'll end up getting hurt or[n]worse if you just jump into this line of[n]work without thinking.

[msg MSG_018 [Ann]]
Hey, stop that, you two! No scaring off[n]our new member!

[msg MSG_019 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hmm... So these clothes won't work? Is[n]having a mask an absolute must?

[msg MSG_020 [Yusuke]]
Body painting is always an option. I'm[n]quite curious about how it feels to[n]brush directly onto a person's skin.

[msg MSG_021 [Futaba]]
Better stop right there, Inari... I feel[n]like you're gonna get arrested at this[n]rate.

[msg MSG_022 [Hikari]]
But, companions? I don't understand...

[msg MSG_023 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hikari-chan?

[msg MSG_024 [Hikari]]
It's... nothing...

[msg MSG_025 [Nagi]]
Hikari-san...

[msg MSG_026 [Futaba]]
H-Hikari!

[msg MSG_027 [Hikari]]
Hm?

[msg MSG_028 [Futaba]]
I used to think it's easier being alone[n]too, but―I met everyone, and, um...

[msg MSG_028_5 [Futaba]]
Nowadays, I know it's, like... not bad[n]having friends! R-Right, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]!?

[sel SEL_029 top]
It's not bad at all.
I'm stronger with my friends.
Why are you asking me?

[msg MSG_030 [Hikari]]
I see...
But―I still don't really get it...

[msg MSG_031 [Futaba]]
Oh, c'mon―this kinda thing's supposed to[n]be YOUR job, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]!
A-A-Anyway! Companions are great!

[msg MSG_032 [Hikari]]
I... just don't get it...

[msg MSG_033 [Nagi]]
Come now, isn't there something of more[n]importance at the moment?
It appears the movie will not change[n]until you progress further within it.

[msg MSG_034 [Hikari]]
Mmhm... Nothing happened until now...[n]There hadn't been any changes at all...
But, when you all came here... the plot[n]suddenly started to progress.

[msg MSG_035 [Morgana]]
Hmm... That means we've really gotta get[n]back in there―I'm worried about the[n]ladies.

[msg MSG_036 [Akechi]]
Right. If we're going to learn anything[n]about this place, we need to return to[n]the movie.

[msg MSG_037 [Morgana]]
All right, Joker, give us the[n]infiltration signal when you're ready!
