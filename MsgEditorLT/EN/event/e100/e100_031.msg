Whaâ€•Whoooaaah! What's that!?

[msg MSG_005 [Akechi]]
Is it a Shadow!?

[msg MSG_006 [Cryptic black object]]
......

[msg MSG_007 [Ann]]
It's suspicious, but... it doesn't seem[n]to be an enemy? What is this thing!?

[sel SEL_008 top]
I'm gonna poke it.
Let's try talking to it.

[msg MSG_009 [Morgana]]
I hope it doesn't attack you... Be[n]careful, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0].

[msg MSG_010]
......?
It feels really weird...

[msg MSG_011 [Futaba]]
Are you okay? Nothing bad happened? It[n]just goes "boing-boing" when you poke[n]it?
Okay... Someone try talking to it.

[msg MSG_012 [Ann]]
H-Hellooo? Can you hear me?

[msg MSG_013 [Cryptic black object]]
......

[msg MSG_014 [Futaba]]
No reply. It's just a boingy object.

[msg MSG_015 [Morgana]]
Well, in that case... where are its[n]ears?

[msg MSG_016 [Ann]]
If we're loud enough, won't it get the[n]gist of what we're saying?

[msg MSG_016_5 [Ann]]
H-Hellooo? Can you hear me?

[msg MSG_017 [Cryptic black object]]
......

[msg MSG_018 [Futaba]]
It's not reacting... Maybe it can't hear[n]us?
There's nothing left except to try[n]touching it... Ryuji!

[msg MSG_019 [Ryuji]]
Why me!?
Ugh, fine... Are you guys sure it's okay[n]for me to be doing this?

[msg MSG_020 [Ryuji]]
Whoa! It's super-spongy!

[msg MSG_021 [Akechi]]
Well, we've learned that it's elastic,[n]but it appears to be non-communicative[n]as well.

[msg MSG_022 [Yusuke]]
It doesn't speak, or move, or react to[n]us at all...
Perhaps this is some kind of doll?

[msg MSG_023 [Futaba]]
O-Oh, okay... It's just a doll, huh?[n]It's way too big, though. At least make[n]it 1/7th scale.

[msg MSG_024 [Morgana]]
Well, the ladies aren't here, so let's[n]keep searching.
