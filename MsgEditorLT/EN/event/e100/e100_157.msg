Joker! Wait! Stop, stoooop!

[msg MSG_001 [Ann]]
Ah―What is it!?

[msg MSG_002 [Yusuke]]
Is there a trap ahead?

[msg MSG_003 [Futaba]]
No, it's about something back here, in[n]the movie theater!
Remember that door we found that had[n]"Authorized Personnel Only" on it?

[msg MSG_004 [Ryuji]]
Oh, you mean that locked one? What about[n]it?

[msg MSG_005 [Futaba]]
I suddenly picked up a bizarre, super-[n]strong reading beyond that door.

[msg MSG_006 [Ann]]
A reading? You mean an enemy?

[msg MSG_007 [Futaba]]
No, it's totally new to me―some strange[n]presence, and even Nagi doesn't know[n]what it could be...
It's highly unlikely to be Queen and[n]Noir, but I still think we should check[n]it out.

[msg MSG_008 [Akechi]]
If so, then we'll need to return to the[n]movie theater... It's your call.

[sel SEL_009 top]
Let's head back now.
Let's go check it out.

[msg MSG_010 [Futaba]]
Okay, come back as quick as you can![n]I'll be waiting!

[msg MSG_011 [Yusuke]]
A mysterious presence, eh? I'm curious[n]as to what it could be...
