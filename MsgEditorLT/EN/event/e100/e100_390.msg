I hope the power controls for the lights[n]are somewhere in this sewer...
*chuckle* I want to study every detail[n]here... An opportunity like this may not[n]come again in my lifetime.

[msg MSG_001 [Morgana]]
Urp―there's no way I wanna be down here[n]for that long...
This place reeks―it's so bitter and sour[n]that it's nearly overwhelming... *gag*

[msg MSG_002 [Ryuji]]
I bet you've got a strong sense of smell[n]too, Mona... It's pretty awful even for[n]me right now.

[msg MSG_003 [P3 Fem Protag]]
This is my first time ever in a[n]manhole... No wonder you're all phantom[n]thieves!

[msg MSG_004 [Ryuji]]
Well, at least she's having fun...

[msg MSG_005 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Usually in movies, when the characters[n]go into a manhole, water ends up rushing[n]at them...
If that happens, will we have to swim,[n]or do you have some other phantom[n]thief-y trick to deal with it?

[sel SEL_006 top]
That would be impossible.
Skull's pulled it off before.
If worse comes to worst...

[msg MSG_007 [Ryuji]]
There's no way anyone could do that![n]What do you think a phantom thief really[n]is!?

[msg MSG_008 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Ahaha... I had a feeling that was the[n]case.

[msg MSG_009 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Really!? That's amazing, Skull! And your[n]mask looks so heavy, too...

[msg MSG_010 [Ryuji]]
You moron, don't feed her that crap![n]Even I would never swim in the sewers!

[msg MSG_011 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Really!? I was just joking, too... I[n]can't believe phantom thieves can even[n]do that!

[msg MSG_012 [Ann]]
Stop right there―that's not happening!

[msg MSG_013 [Akechi]]
Well, it seems to grow much darker up[n]ahead. We should proceed with caution.

[msg MSG_014 [Ryuji]]
It's darker than I thought―and it still[n]smells awful...

[msg MSG_015 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Wait a sec―did you hear something just[n]now?

[msg MSG_016 [Morgana]]
Nyaaaaaaaaaagh!?

[msg MSG_017 [Ann]]
Aah! Wh-What is it!?

[msg MSG_018 [Morgana]]
G-G-Giant rat―just ran past me―super[n]huge!!!

[msg MSG_019 [Ryuji]]
Sheesh, just a rat? Talk about the cat[n]cryin' wolf...

[msg MSG_020 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Ahaha, are you scared of rats, Mona?[n]That's kinda cute, considering your[n]appearance and all.

[msg MSG_021 [Morgana]]
... I'm going to use this opportunity to[n]say that I only APPEAR to be a cat. GOT[n]IT?
I'm supposed to be human! ...I think.

[msg MSG_022 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Huh? Mona's supposed to be human... What[n]does that mean?

[sel SEL_023 top]
It's just like the man says.
It's just like the kitty says.
He's just a grumpy monster cat.

[msg MSG_024 [Morgana]]
Hey! Don't go calling me a cat after all[n]that!

[msg MSG_025 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hmm? Does that mean he's a human taking[n]the form of a cat―or, the other way[n]around?

[msg MSG_026 [Ryuji]]
Uh, let's just stop now. Talkin' about[n]Mona's way too much trouble.

[msg MSG_027 [Morgana]]
What!? What do you mean, "too much[n]trouble"? My looks have something to do[n]with my origin and―

[msg MSG_028 [Ryuji]]
Hey, it's not like we can figure it all[n]out just by talkin' about it, right?[n]It'd only bum you out in the end.

[msg MSG_029 [Morgana]]
O-Oh... that's true.

[msg MSG_030 [Ann]]
Hey, it smells here, so can we hurry up?[n]I feel like the stench is gonna cling to[n]my outfit...

[msg MSG_031 [Akechi]]
She's right―let's keep looking for clues[n]to the statue's lighting.
