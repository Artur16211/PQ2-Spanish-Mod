The entrance to the screening room...
and Yusuke are working with Nagi...

[msg MSG_001 [Yusuke]]
Ah, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0].

[sel SEL_002 top]
How's it going so far?
Any issues to report?

[msg MSG_003 [Yusuke]]
We were just asking Nagi-san if she[n]could find the supplies that I need.

[msg MSG_004 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Nagi-san! Did you have any luck?

[msg MSG_005 [Nagi]]
Yes―just as you predicted, there were[n]unused ones in the supply room.
I've also found the set of tools you[n]requested. Still... they're rather old,[n]so I'm unsure if they'll be of any use.

[msg MSG_006 [Yusuke]]
No, this is more than enough. The rest[n]is dependent on my artistic skills...
Thank you for your assistance, Nagi-san.

[msg MSG_007 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Mm, I think we got this!
That reminds me, what kind of art do you[n]usually make, Yusuke-kun?

[msg MSG_008 [Yusuke]]
Well... Hm, how should I describe it?[n]This is difficult to put into words...

[sel SEL_009 top]
Art portraying beautiful women.
Nude portraiture.
The very essence of beauty.

[msg MSG_010 [Yusuke]]
There is that, but that's not all...
What I'm attempting to depict is beauty[n]itself.

[msg MSG_011 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Nude... Ohh, like sketching nude models?

[msg MSG_012 [Yusuke]]
Unfortunately though, I've never had the[n]chance to do that. I only hope the[n]opportunity presents itself again...
But, what I truly want to depict is[n]nothing less than beauty itself.

[msg MSG_013 [Yusuke]]
As I'd hoped, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]―you truly[n]understand me!
Just as he said, what I strive to depict[n]is nothing less than beauty itself.

[msg MSG_014 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Beauty?

[msg MSG_015 [Yusuke]]
Yes, but I do not mean superficial[n]beauty.
There is both beauty and foulness within[n]one's heart. I wish to capture the[n]fierce, yet heartrending conflict of―

[msg MSG_016 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Um, sorry! You seem to have a lot to say[n]about this, so maybe... you can tell me[n]about it later?
We probably ought to get back to work!

[msg MSG_017]
It seems things are okay here. I should[n]head back for the time being...

[msg MSG_018]
It seems things are okay here. Maybe I[n]should go check on the others...
