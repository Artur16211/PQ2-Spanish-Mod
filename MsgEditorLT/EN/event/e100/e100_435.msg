The theater lobby...
Futaba and Morgana are talking to[n]Hikari...

[msg MSG_001 [Hikari]]
I can understand wanting your friends[n]back, but... you're up against someone[n]so strong...
It'll be hard to win, so... why?

[msg MSG_002 [Futaba]]
It'll be hard, huh...

[msg MSG_002_5 [Futaba]]
It's true, he's definitely using cheat[n]codes―if we went up against him like[n]usual, it'd be impossible to win...

[msg MSG_003 [Morgana]]
But, if we abandon our friends just[n]because it'll be hard to win, it'd[n]tarnish the Phantom Thieves' name.
I mean... You get what I'm saying,[n]right, [f 6 1 30 0 0 0]?

[sel SEL_004 top]
We can't assume it's impossible.
We each have the will of a rebel.

[msg MSG_005 [Morgana]]
Right, it's too early to write that off.[n]We'll never go down without a fight.

[msg MSG_006 [Futaba]]
Yeah, that's right! The Phantom Thieves[n]won't back down that easily.
I'd never want to stay silent or let[n]someone do whatever they want to me just[n]because they're strong.

[msg MSG_007 [Hikari]]
A... rebel?

[msg MSG_008 [Morgana]]
You wouldn't want to stay silent or let[n]someone walk all over you just because[n]they've got power, right?
So, we'll rebel, through and through,[n]for the sake of our own justice.

[msg MSG_009 [Futaba]]
Yeah, that's right! The Phantom Thieves[n]won't back down that easily.

[msg MSG_010 [Hikari]]
......!
B-But... will you really be okay?

[msg MSG_011 [Morgana]]
We're really grateful for your[n]concern...

[msg MSG_012 [Futaba]]
But, it's no prob!
We're gonna show you the best ending,[n]Hikari―just you wait and see!

[msg MSG_013 [Hikari]]
Mm...

[msg MSG_014]
It seems things are okay here. I should[n]head back for the time being...

[msg MSG_015]
It seems things are okay here. Maybe I[n]should go check on the others...
