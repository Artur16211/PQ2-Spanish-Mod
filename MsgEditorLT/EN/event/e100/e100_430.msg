The concession stand...
Ann and Ryuji are explaining the plan to[n]Theodore...

[msg MSG_001 [Ann]]
...And that's why we need so many. Would[n]you be able to prepare them for us?

[msg MSG_002 [Theodore]]
Dear me, this is quite the bold[n]request...
But it's also a very exciting plan. I[n]shall prepare them for you at once.

[msg MSG_003 [Ryuji]]
Thanks, Theodore!
...Oh hey, didn't see you there,. Did[n]you come to check up on us?

[msg MSG_004 [Ann]]
*giggle* Looks like our part's going to[n]work out. It was a pretty tall order,[n]though.

[msg MSG_005 [Theodore]]
Please, think nothing of itâ€•I will fill[n]this order of great stature immediately.

[msg MSG_006 [Ryuji]]
We've gotta surprise the hell outta that[n]fake hero, so we better make this look[n]good!

[msg MSG_007 [Ann]]
Right! I mean, I know that he's someone[n]else, but he still has that bastard's[n]face... It only pisses me off more.

[msg MSG_008 [Ryuji]]
Huh... Then, how would you've reacted if[n]Kamoshidaman was super hot?

[sel SEL_009 top]
Evil is evil, no matter how hot.
I might cut him some slack then...
I'd hate his guts even more.

[msg MSG_010 [Ryuji]]
Yeah, I gotta agree with that. No matter[n]what face he has, what he's doin' is[n]unforgivable.

[msg MSG_011 [Ann]]
He's treated Makoto and Haru so[n]horribly... Either way, we won't let him[n]get away with what he's done.

[msg MSG_012 [Ryuji]]
Dude, for real!?

[msg MSG_013 [Ann]]
Well, if I hate Kamoshida 100-fold, it[n]might go down to about 99-fold...
But he's treated Makoto and Haru so[n]horribly... Either way, he's definitely[n]unforgivable!

[msg MSG_014 [Ryuji]]
O-Okay... I wasn't asking you, though...

[msg MSG_015 [Ann]]
He's treated Makoto and Haru so[n]horribly... Either way, he's definitely[n]unforgivable!

[msg MSG_016 [Ryuji]]
Anyways, looks like we've locked things[n]down on our end...
If you haven't checked on everybody else[n]yet, go right ahead.

[msg MSG_017]
It seems things are okay here. I should[n]head back for the time being...

[msg MSG_018]
It seems things are okay here. Maybe I[n]should go check on the others...

[sel SEL_019 top]
Akechi and Elizabeth
and Yusuke
Morgana and Futaba
