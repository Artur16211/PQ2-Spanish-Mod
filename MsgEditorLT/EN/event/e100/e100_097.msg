Ryuji's hand passed right through the[n]movie screen...

[msg MSG_001 [Ryuji]]
M-My hand!?
My hand, like, went INTO the screen!
That really happened, right!?

[msg MSG_002 [Akechi]]
This is absolutely unbelievable...

[msg MSG_003 [Ann]]
Hold on a sec. If Makoto and Haru were[n]with us inside the movie earlier...
Does that mean we left them behind in[n]that place on the other side of the[n]screen?

[msg MSG_004 [Nagi]]
I'm afraid that appears to be the[n]case...

[msg MSG_005 [Yusuke]]
Basically, if we wanted to rescue them,[n]our only option is to go back inside the[n]film.

[msg MSG_006 [Ryuji]]
We gotta go save 'em! Right,?

[sel SEL_007 top]
Of course we do.
Let's hurry up and go.

[msg MSG_008 [Morgana]]
All right, then let's get to―Wait, are[n]we supposed to just... jump in?

[msg MSG_009 [Hikari]]
Oh―Nagi-san...

[msg MSG_010 [Nagi]]
What's that?

[msg MSG_011]
She's whispering to Nagi again...

[msg MSG_012 [Nagi]]
Hikari-san is terribly worried about[n]your safety.
Since it's dangerous inside the movie,[n]she thinks it may be safer for you to[n]stay here.

[msg MSG_013 [Ryuji]]
Thanks for the warning, but that danger[n]only makes us more worried about 'em.

[msg MSG_014 [Ann]]
Yeah! We have to get in there ASAP for[n]our friends!

[msg MSG_015 [Hikari]]
Huh?

[msg MSG_016 [Hikari]]
For your friends?
......
But, friends are...

[msg MSG_017 [Futaba]]
...Hikari?

[msg MSG_018 [Ryuji]]
Okay! Everybody, brace yourselves, we're[n]jumpin' in! 3, 2, 1―

[msg MSG_019 [Hikari]]
W-Wait!

[msg MSG_020 [Ryuji]]
Whoa! What's up now!?

[msg MSG_021 [Hikari]]
......

[msg MSG_022 [Ryuji]]
Uhh...

[msg MSG_023 [Hikari]]
Um―please wait a second...

[msg MSG_024]
Hikari is consulting with Nagi about[n]something...

[msg MSG_025 [Hikari]]
...Is that okay?

[msg MSG_026 [Nagi]]
Yes, I understand...

[msg MSG_027 [Nagi]]
Hikari-san is still worried about you...
So she's asked me to lend you my help.

[msg MSG_028 [Yusuke]]
Do you have anything in mind that could[n]benefit us?

[msg MSG_029 [Nagi]]
Indeed, I may be able to offer some[n]assistance. Won't you please follow me?

[msg MSG_030]
Nagi's heading towards the concession[n]stand...

[msg MSG_031 [Morgana]]
If she's gonna help us, then let's see[n]what she's up to before we get back in[n]the movie.
