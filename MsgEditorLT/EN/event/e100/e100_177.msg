Over here is the shop... After you,[n]please.

[msg MSG_001 [Theodore]]
Ah, this is quite impressive. There is[n]an abundance of space...
I believe that I can prepare a number of[n]items here that will be useful to you.

[msg MSG_002 [Ann]]
Ooh, like what? Maybe some new sweets?

[msg MSG_003 [Theodore]]
Well... I'm afraid I don't know all the[n]details just yet. I do apologize for[n]that.
I must first prepare for the grand[n]opening, so won't you allow me some time[n]to do so?
I vow to provide an assortment of goods[n]that will make your hearts dance in[n]rapture.

[sel SEL_004 top]
I can't wait to see that.
Are you sure you can do that?
Give us wholesale prices.

[msg MSG_005 [Theodore]]
Please leave it to me! I will make sure[n]to surpass your every expectation!

[msg MSG_006 [Theodore]]
Yes―I swear upon the Velvet Room name[n]that I will fully satisfy your needs!

[msg MSG_007 [Theodore]]
Wholesale... prices?
...Ah! I understand. There's no need to[n]worry about that.
All the wares I shall sell you will be[n]entirely whole, with prices to match. I[n]have no interest in half-measures!

[msg MSG_008 [Akechi]]
You seem to be having fun, Theodore.[n]It's as if you're a veteran shopkeeper.

[msg MSG_009 [Theodore]]
Veteran... What a wonderful ring that[n]term has!
I've merely come to realize that I don't[n]mind doing things of this nature.

[msg MSG_010 [Elizabeth]]
By the way―*munch munch* My[n]guests―*munch munch*
They seem to be lost too... *munch* My,[n]this foodstuff called popcorn... *munch*[n]*munch* *munch*

[msg MSG_011 [Theodore]]
Sister! It's ill-mannered to eat and[n]speak at the same time...

[msg MSG_012 [Elizabeth]]
Theo, you should―*munch munch* ―try[n]shoving this much in your mouth at once[n]as well... *munch munch*

[msg MSG_013 [Theodore]]
Are you attempting to desiccate me!?[n]This is just like that confounded[n]soybean powder all over again!

[msg MSG_014 [Hikari]]
U-Uhm...

[msg MSG_015 [Futaba]]
I-It's okay!

[msg MSG_016 [Hikari]]
...O-Okay.

[msg MSG_017 [Theodore]]
*munch munch* My, this is quite...[n]*munch munch*
Hmm... If I were to change the[n]seasonings―*munch* perhaps I could[n]create new flavors...

[msg MSG_018 [Hikari]]
Huh? New flavors?

[msg MSG_019 [Theodore]]
Oh? Does that interest you?
Then, I shall fully devote myself to the[n]creation of new varieties of popcorn.

[msg MSG_020 [Hikari]]
Um... Nagi-san?

[msg MSG_021 [Nagi]]
*chuckle* It's fine by me―especially if[n]it would be of assistance to everyone.
Also, I could not say no after seeing[n]such a hopeful look on your face,[n]Hikari-san.

[msg MSG_022 [Hikari]]
Huh? Um, mmhm...

[msg MSG_023 [Yusuke]]
We'll leave it to you, then. I look[n]forward to the new varieties of popcorn[n]as well... *chuckle*

[msg MSG_024 [Theodore]]
Of course! Now, please wait just a short[n]while longer until my preparations here[n]are completed.
