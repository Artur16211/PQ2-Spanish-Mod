It's too early to celebrateâ€•now comes[n]the important part.
Since we've secured our route to the[n]switchboard, we can turn off the lights[n]whenever we please.

All that's left is to determine how[n]we'll steal the statue from the square.

[msg MSG_004 [Morgana]]
Let's head back to work out the details[n]of the operation.
If we stick around here, some backup for[n]our unconscious friend might show up.
