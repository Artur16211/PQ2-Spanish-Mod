[msg MSG_000 [Ryuji]]
Wh-Where the hell are we!? It was a[n]whole, entire city just a second ago!

[msg MSG_001 [Yusuke]]
Look, there's some kind of screen.

[msg MSG_002 [Futaba]]
Is this... a movie theater?

[msg MSG_003 [Ann]]
Why are we the only ones here? It's kind[n]of creepy...

[msg MSG_004 [Morgana]]
Hmm... I genuinely have no clue what's[n]going on.
First we were in Mementos, then we ended[n]up in some city... Now, a movie theater?

[msg MSG_005 [Ryuji]]
Hey, our clothes! They're back to[n]normal!?

[msg MSG_006 [Ann]]
Oh, you're right!

[msg MSG_007 [Morgana]]
Hm―Why only me!? What's going on here?

[msg MSG_007_5 [Morgana]]
Well, fine. If all of your clothes have[n]returned to normal...
And if we're truly still in the[n]cognitive world, then we aren't seen as[n]a threat here.

[msg MSG_008 [Akechi]]
Although, it seems we can't use the[n]Meta-Nav in here, either...
We seem to be somewhere different from[n]that city―but still in a bizarre[n]situation...

[msg MSG_009 [Ann]]
Hey, wait a sec! Where are Makoto and[n]Haru!?

[msg MSG_010 [Ryuji]]
Huh? They're right he―

[msg MSG_011 [Ryuji]]
―Wait, they're not here!

[msg MSG_012 [Yusuke]]
Could it be that we were separated?

[msg MSG_013 [Ryuji]]
Holy shit, for real!?

[msg MSG_014 [Ann]]
We have to go find them! They might[n]still be in that place where we just[n]were!

[msg MSG_015 [Yusuke]]
But, how do we get back? We don't even[n]know how we arrived here in the first[n]place...

[msg MSG_016 [Akechi]]
Hold on, let's all calm down. They may[n]be somewhere within this building.
There's a door right over there. Why[n]don't we try exploring beyond this room[n]first?

[msg MSG_017 [Ryuji]]
Y-Yeah... Sorry, all of this has got me[n]worked up.

[msg MSG_018 [Futaba]]
I have plenty of comments on all of[n]this― but finding Haru and Makoto comes[n]first!

[sel SEL_019 top]
That's right.
Let's be careful about this.

[msg MSG_020 [Morgana]]
In that case, let's get going! Stay on[n]your toes, everyone.
