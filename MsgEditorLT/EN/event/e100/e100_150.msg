[msg MSG_000 [Ann]]
Whew! We managed to slip past that[n]thing...

[msg MSG_001 [Yusuke]]
To think something like that is[n]wandering around here... What is this[n]place, truly?

[msg MSG_002 [Akechi]]
Kamoshidaman's city... I believe it was[n]called "Kamo City" by the police officer[n]earlier.

[msg MSG_003 [Ryuji]]
Kamo City, eh... Seriously, what do you[n]think of that name?

[sel SEL_004 top]
It sickens me.
It's too on the nose.
I don't really care.

[msg MSG_005 [Ryuji]]
Right? Seriously, to hell with a city[n]named after Kamoshida!

[msg MSG_006 [Ryuji]]
It's literally an entire city for[n]Kamoshida, right? Seriously, to hell[n]with that!

[msg MSG_007 [Ryuji]]
What! Are you shittin' me? It's an[n]entire city named after Kamoshida―that[n]name alone is the worst!

[msg MSG_008 [Yusuke]]
Kamoshida... If I recall correctly, he's[n]a former teacher at Shujin High, no?

[msg MSG_009 [Ann]]
Yeah―he was the coach of the volleyball[n]team. A whole lot of people got abused[n]by him over the years...

[msg MSG_010 [Ryuji]]
...And it wasn't just physical abuse,[n]either.
We almost got expelled by him, and[n]Panther went through an even worse[n]hell...
He was the worst piece of shit who saw[n]himself as some kinda king and just did[n]whatever he wanted.

[msg MSG_011 [Akechi]]
A criminal with distorted desires―the[n]first target of the Phantom Thieves.

[msg MSG_012 [Ryuji]]
So, that bastard... You're tellin' me[n]he's some sorta superhero here?

[msg MSG_013 [Ann]]
There's just... no way! This can't be[n]happening!

[msg MSG_014 [Akechi]]
I can understand how you two feel, but[n]we need to keep our wits about us here.
From what I've gathered so far,[n]Kamoshidaman and Kamoshida should be two[n]different people.

[msg MSG_015 [Yusuke]]
What leads you to believe so?

[msg MSG_016 [Akechi]]
Remember what Nagi-san told us...
How the hero character's appearance[n]changed after we entered the movie?

[msg MSG_017 [Ann]]
Oh yeah, she did say something like[n]that.
He wasn't Kamoshidaman before we came[n]here, apparently.

[msg MSG_018 [Yusuke]]
So in other words, that "hero of[n]justice" is only assuming the appearance[n]of Kamoshida?

[msg MSG_019 [Akechi]]
That's my current working theory.

[msg MSG_020 [Ann]]
But... why Kamoshida? That's a totally[n]miscast role.
Could it be related to us coming here?

[msg MSG_021 [Akechi]]
Well... Joker, what do you think?
Are we somehow involved in the movie's[n]hero taking on Kamoshida's appearance?

[sel SEL_022 top]
It has to be related.
It's just a coincidence.
I don't know.

[msg MSG_023 [Akechi]]
Mm, I agree.
However, we have too few clues to be[n]able to make that sort of conclusion[n]yet...

[msg MSG_024 [Akechi]]
I won't deny that possibility―but I[n]believe there's some kind of causality[n]here.
However, we have too few clues to make[n]that sort of conclusion yet...

[msg MSG_025 [Akechi]]
True. We have too few clues to make that[n]sort of conclusion yet...

[msg MSG_026 [Yusuke]]
Then all we can do for now is press on.

[msg MSG_027 [Ryuji]]
Right! We gotta hurry up and find those[n]two!

[msg MSG_028 [Ann]]
Yeah―let's get going!
