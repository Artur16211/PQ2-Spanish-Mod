[msg MSG_000 [Ryuji]]
Tch... There's a cop here, too.

[msg MSG_001 [Ann]]
Look! Over there!

[msg MSG_002 [Yusuke]]
...Is that a switchboard?

[msg MSG_003 [Akechi]]
Our prediction was correct. If those[n]switches are for the statue's[n]lighting...

[msg MSG_004 [Morgana]]
We can turn the lights off from down[n]here!?

[msg MSG_005 [Yusuke]]
With the statue shrouded in darkness,[n]we'd be able to steal it much more[n]easily.

[msg MSG_006 [Ryuji]]
Well, let's hurry up and take out that[n]cop―then the switchboard'll be all ours!

[msg MSG_007 [Morgana]]
Wait―considering how dark and narrow[n]this place is, it'd be best to avoid[n]using force.
If we were to cause a ruckus, we'd[n]definitely end up getting cornered down[n]here...

[msg MSG_008 [Akechi]]
Not only that, it would be useless to[n]turn off the statue's lights right now.
It'd only allow Kamoshidaman to catch on[n]to our presence.

[msg MSG_009 [Ryuji]]
So we're gonna trick that cop to make[n]him go away? How're we pullin' that off?

[sel SEL_010 top]
Time for some sex appeal.
Time for the disguise.
Time for a lil' meow-meow.

[msg MSG_011 [Ryuji]]
So... Panther?

[msg MSG_012 [Morgana]]
No, we can't leave this whole operation[n]up to her acting skills...

[msg MSG_013 [Ryuji]]
That's what I thought too.

[msg MSG_014 [Ann]]
Hey! What's that supposed to mean!?

[msg MSG_015 [Yusuke]]
Wouldn't now be the time to make use of[n]that uniform?

[msg MSG_016 [Yusuke]]
Right. Now's the time to make use of[n]that uniform.

[msg MSG_017 [Ryuji]]
Ohhh, like, he might let his guard down[n]if a cute animal walks up to him?

[msg MSG_018 [Morgana]]
Who're you calling an animal!?

[msg MSG_019 [Ann]]
It's too dangerous to go alone, even for[n]Mona―plus, there's no guarantee he's a[n]cat lover.

[msg MSG_020 [Morgana]]
......

[msg MSG_021 [Yusuke]]
Wouldn't now be the time to make use of[n]that uniform?

[msg MSG_022 [Akechi]]
Ah, yes, the police uniform we[n]reappropriated.
So, should someone in disguise order a[n]fake shift change to get rid of that[n]policeman?
That would secure our route to the[n]switchboard with the least amount of[n]trouble.

[msg MSG_023 [P3 Fem Protag]]
So, that means it's my turn?

[msg MSG_024 [Ann]]
Won't it be dangerous? I mean, you're[n]not exactly used to this kinda thing,[n]right?

[msg MSG_025 [P3 Fem Protag]]
I'll be fine! I've gotten through some[n]pretty tough scrapes before.
I may not be a full-fledged phantom[n]thief, but I can pull this off! Don't[n]worry about me, okay?

[sel SEL_026 top]
By all means.
We've got your back.

[msg MSG_027 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Thanks! Well, I'm gonna go change over[n]there real quick...

[msg MSG_028 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Ta-daaah! Whaddaya think? Does it suit[n]me?

[msg MSG_029 [Morgana]]
Ohhh, not bad at all! You look pretty[n]cute in that!

[msg MSG_030 [Ryuji]]
But... is that really how a cop looks?[n]She's pretty obviously cosplayi―

[msg MSG_031 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Oh, it'll be fine! I'll go over to the[n]switchboard now.

[msg MSG_032 [Ann]]
Don't do anything reckless, alright?

[msg MSG_033 [Yusuke]]
Give us a signal if anything goes awry.[n]We'll come back you up immediately.

[msg MSG_034 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Great! Now, watch this!

[msg MSG_035]
Fully disguised, [f 6 1 27 0 0 0] walked over to[n]address the cop...

[msg MSG_036 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Sir! I've been assigned to take over[n]this area, sir!

[msg MSG_037 [Tall policeman]]
...Hmm? But, I was assigned this sector[n]just the other day?

[msg MSG_038 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Um, I was informed that it's a[n]relocation of personnel! I mean...[n]That's what Kamoshidaman-san told me!

[msg MSG_039 [Tall policeman]]
"Kamoshidaman-san"? Why're you referring[n]to him like that?
......
Well, fine... Just give me the password.

[msg MSG_040 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Eh? The password?

[msg MSG_041 [Ryuji]]
Oh shit―she's already in trouble!

[msg MSG_042 [Ann]]
What do we do? Should we jump in?

[msg MSG_043 [Morgana]]
No, let's watch a bit longer―if push[n]comes to shove, we'll jump in there[n]right away.

[msg MSG_044 [Tall policeman]]
What's the matter? C'mon, password...

[msg MSG_045 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Ahh―I'm sorry. I'm so anxious, I totally[n]forgot it!
Well, this is Kamoshidaman's city, and[n]we're policemen, so...
Kamo... Kamo...

[msg MSG_046 [Tall policeman]]
Wha―"Kamo Kamo"?

[msg MSG_047 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Wait―Kamo City's police... Police...[n]Kamo Police... Police Kamo... Kamo[n]Kamo...

[msg MSG_048 [Akechi]]
Oh dear. She's just spinning in[n]circles...

[msg MSG_049 [Tall policeman]]
...Fine.

[msg MSG_050 [Akechi]]
Wha―!?

[msg MSG_051 [P3 Fem Protag]]
No way, I was right!?

[msg MSG_052 [Tall policeman]]
Of course not! I meant it like, "Fine,[n]I'm through dealing with your nonsense."
There is no password! It was a trick[n]question, stupid!

[msg MSG_053 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Hey, no fair! My disguise was perfect[n]and everything!

[msg MSG_054 [Tall policeman]]
I'm turning you in right now. Looks like[n]you're gonna be part of the punishment[n]exhibition!

[msg MSG_055 [Morgana]]
This is bad―let's move!

[msg MSG_056 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Too slow!

[msg MSG_057 [Tall policeman]]
AWGH―

[msg MSG_058]
She just knocked out the cop with a chop[n]to the neck!

[msg MSG_059 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Phew, that was close...

[msg MSG_059_5 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Okay, better do this before he wakes[n]up―where are his handcuffs? Oh, here we[n]go...

[msg MSG_060]
cuffs and gags the unconscious cop...

[msg MSG_061 [Ryuji]]
Hoooly shit... She went to town on that[n]guy!

[msg MSG_062 [Morgana]]
She's way too good at that...

[msg MSG_063 [P3 Fem Protag]]
And there―we―go.

[msg MSG_064 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Sorry for the wait, but the mission was[n]a success!

[msg MSG_065 [Ryuji]]
Uh, no!? That wasn't our plan at all! We[n]wanted him to walk away, not go comatose[n]on us!
And that chop―what are you, some kinda[n]hitman!?

[msg MSG_066 [P3 Fem Protag]]
Ahaha, oh, that? I saw it in a movie[n]once, so I figured I'd give it a try.
Looks like it turned out okay―I mean, I[n]still pulled it off, right?
That was my first time tricking an enemy[n]before taking them out. It was so fun!

[msg MSG_067 [Yusuke]]
But, you didn't succeed at tricking him[n]in the least...

[msg MSG_068 [Ann]]
Well, she didn't get hurt, so let's just[n]call it a success. Thanks for the[n]assist,-chan!

[msg MSG_069 [P3 Fem Protag]]
*giggle* No problem at all. Glad to[n]help!

[msg MSG_070 [Morgana]]
Now that we've got our route to the[n]switchboard, we can turn off the lights[n]whenever we please.

[msg MSG_071 [Akechi]]
All that's left is to determine how[n]we'll steal the statue from the square.

[msg MSG_072 [Morgana]]
Let's head back to work out the details[n]of the operation.
After all, this place smells horrible...[n]Urp...

[msg MSG_073 [Yusuke]]
Well then, shall we return to the[n]theater, Joker?
