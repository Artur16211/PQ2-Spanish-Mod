[msg town_warning_quest [Rise]]
You haven't taken on any special[n]screenings. Are you sure?

[msg town_warning_persona [Rise]]
Senpai, be careful. There's someone in[n]your party who hasn't taken on a[n]Sub-Persona.

[msg town_warning_both [Rise]]
Senpai, be careful. There's someone in[n]your party who hasn't taken on a[n]Sub-Persona.
And it looks like you don't even have[n]any [f 4 4 3 0 1333]s with you. Are you sure[n]you're ready to go?

[msg town_goukon_event_p3 [Fuuka]]
Leader, let's hold off on going back to[n]that labyrinth. We should go check the[n]next one for now.

[msg town_goukon_event_p4 [Rise]]
Senpai, we can go back to that labyrinth[n]later. Let's go check the next one[n]first.

[msg town_odekake_alone]
Nothing of interest is going on in the[n]school. Perhaps you should check again[n]later...

[msg town_1st_warning_p4 [Rise]]
Senpai, we can go back to that labyrinth[n]later. Let's go check the next one[n]first.

[msg town_warning_dungeon_p4 [Rise]]
Senpai, do you have any Goho-Ms with[n]you?
If you use a Goho-M in the labyrinth,[n]you should be able to get back here.
Don't push yourself too hard, okay? If[n]it ever gets too rough in there, just[n]use it and get out.
You can heal up and change your[n]equipment back here, so let's take our[n]time and do this right!

[msg town_warning_dungeon_p3 [Fuuka]]
Leader, do you have the Goho-M that Theo[n]gave you?
If you use a Goho-M in the labyrinth, it[n]will allow you to return here.
It might get really dangerous in there.[n]If you get into trouble, just use it and[n]get to safety.
You can heal your party and change[n]equipment here, so just remember you've[n]always got a backup plan!

[msg town_quest_find]
