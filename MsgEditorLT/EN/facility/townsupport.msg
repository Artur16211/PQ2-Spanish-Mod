If this comes up, it's a bug. REPORT IT,[n]por favor!

[msg town_okaeri_HIKARI_mes01]
...Are you... hurt anywhere...?

[msg town_okaeri_HIKARI_mes02]
Welcome back...

[msg town_okaeri_HIKARI_mes03]
Everyone...! I'm glad you're back.

[msg town_okaeri_HIKARI_mes04]
Let's make sure we're ready before we[n]head out.

[msg town_okaeri_HIKARI_mes05]
Welcome back, everyone!

[msg town_okaeri_NAGI_mes01]
Everyone, make sure you get the rest you[n]need.

[msg town_okaeri_NAGI_mes02]
I'm truly glad you are safe.

[msg town_okaeri_RYUJI_mes]
Phew... Man, I'm beat.

[msg town_okaeri_ANN_mes]
Hah... Good job, everyone!

[msg town_okaeri_MONA_mes]
You all did pretty well back there!

[msg town_okaeri_YUSUKE_mes]
That was a rather stimulating[n]experience.

[msg town_okaeri_FUTABA_mes]
My eyes... All this thinking's giving me[n]a headache.

[msg town_okaeri_AKECHI_mes]
Perfect timing. A breather's just what[n]we need.

[msg town_okaeri_P3HERO2_mes]
Let's make sure we're prepped!

[msg town_okaeri_MAKOTO_mes]
We should rest up while we can.

[msg town_okaeri_HARU_mes]
Nothing like some bracing exercise!

[msg town_okaeri_P4HERO_mes]
Good job, everyone.

[msg town_okaeri_CHIE_mes]
I can't fight on an empty stomach!

[msg town_okaeri_YUKIKO_mes]
Rest is important, too.

[msg town_okaeri_RISE_mes]
Nice work out there, guys!

[msg town_okaeri_KANJI_mes]
I'm gonna go get prepped for the next[n]run!

[msg town_okaeri_NAOTO_mes]
Let's take the opportunity to rest.

[msg town_okaeri_KUMA_mes]
So? Was I great or what!?

[msg town_okaeri_YOUSUKE_mes]
Let's take our break, and get right back[n]into it!

[msg town_okaeri_YUKARI_mes]
Whew... My legs are killing me...

[msg town_okaeri_JUNPEI_mes]
Kick back, fellas, it's breaktime!

[msg town_okaeri_SANADA_mes]
Good... A little muscle cooldown should[n]help.

[msg town_okaeri_MITURU_mes]
Resupplying is crucial to victory.

[msg town_okaeri_FUKA_mes]
Good work out there, everyone!

[msg town_okaeri_AMADA_mes]
Personally, I'm okay to keep fighting...

[msg town_okaeri_KOROMARU_mes]
Arf, arf!

[msg town_okaeri_ARAGAKI_mes]
We can catch our breath. Then it's back[n]in.

[msg town_okaeri_P3HERO_mes]
Nothing wrong with taking a break.

[msg town_okaeri_AEGIS_mes]
Requesting maintenance!

[msg town_returnitem_RYUJI_me]
Ain't we outta Goho-Ms?

[msg town_returnitem_ANN_mes]
You guys got enough Goho-Ms?

[msg town_returnitem_MONA_mes]
Make sure you bring a Goho-M with you!

[msg town_returnitem_YUSUKE_m]
Goho-Ms are important. We cannot forget[n]them.

[msg town_returnitem_FUTABA_m]
Hey, get some Goho-Ms in that pack!

[msg town_returnitem_AKECHI_m]
We have Goho-Ms, I assume?

[msg town_returnitem_P3HERO2_]
Don't forget to bring a Goho-M!

[msg town_returnitem_MAKOTO_m]
Don't forget―we need Goho-Ms.

[msg town_returnitem_HARU_mes]
We should buy some Goho-Ms first, right?

[msg town_returnitem_P4HERO_m]
You should go stock up on Goho-Ms.

[msg town_returnitem_CHIE_mes]
Don't we need some Goho-Ms!?

[msg town_returnitem_YUKIKO_m]
Why don't we buy a Goho-M?

[msg town_returnitem_RISE_mes]
We totally need a Goho-M!

[msg town_returnitem_KANJI_me]
Hey, you oughta grab one of those[n]Goho-Ms...

[msg town_returnitem_NAOTO_me]
I advise we take some Goho-Ms.

[msg town_returnitem_KUMA_mes]
We're all out of Goho-Ms?

[msg town_returnitem_YOUSUKE_]
Let's go grab some Goho-Ms!

[msg town_returnitem_YUKARI_m]
Did you get a Goho-M?

[msg town_returnitem_JUNPEI_m]
Yo, couldn't hurt to have a Goho-M!

[msg town_returnitem_SANADA_m]
We'd better keep some Goho-Ms on hand.

[msg town_returnitem_MITURU_m]
I trust we still have some Goho-Ms[n]left...?

[msg town_returnitem_FUKA_mes]
Are you sure you don't need a Goho-M?

[msg town_returnitem_AMADA_me]
Shouldn't we have at least one Goho-M?

[msg town_returnitem_ARAGAKI_]
Goho-Ms. Don't forget.

[msg town_returnitem_P3HERO_m]
Are you going to be okay without a[n]Goho-M?

[msg town_returnitem_AEGIS_me]
We should procure a Goho-M!

[msg town_new_quest_RYUJI_mes]
We not gonna check the box office?

[msg town_new_quest_ANN_mes]
Let's check out the box office.

[msg town_new_quest_MONA_mes]
We should be checking the box office[n]frequently.

[msg town_new_quest_YUSUKE_me]
I believe someone is watching us from[n]the box office...

[msg town_new_quest_FUTABA_me]
Check the box office every once in a[n]while.

[msg town_new_quest_AKECHI_me]
What, not stopping by the box office?

[msg town_new_quest_P3HERO2_m]
We should check out the box office, too!

[msg town_new_quest_MAKOTO_me]
Maybe we should stop by the box office?

[msg town_new_quest_HARU_mes]
Are we not bound for the box office?

[msg town_new_quest_P4HERO_me]
Shouldn't we stop by the box office?

[msg town_new_quest_CHIE_mes]
You gonna check the box office?

[msg town_new_quest_YUKIKO_me]
Why don't we stop by the box office?

[msg town_new_quest_RISE_mes]
Let's go check out the box office!

[msg town_new_quest_KANJI_mes]
Sure we shouldn't stop by the box[n]office?

[msg town_new_quest_NAOTO_mes]
A visit to the box office wouldn't be a[n]bad idea...

[msg town_new_quest_KUMA_mes]
The box office is calling my name!

[msg town_new_quest_YOUSUKE_m]
Wanna stop by the box office?

[msg town_new_quest_YUKARI_me]
Let's check out the box office.

[msg town_new_quest_JUNPEI_me]
We oughta check out the box office!

[msg town_new_quest_SANADA_me]
We're not heading over to the box[n]office?

[msg town_new_quest_MITURU_me]
Wouldn't it be prudent to check the box[n]office?

[msg town_new_quest_FUKA_mes]
Shouldn't you check the box office?

[msg town_new_quest_AMADA_mes]
Should we stop by the box office?

[msg town_new_quest_ARAGAKI_m]
What, not going to the box office?

[msg town_new_quest_P3HERO_me]
Are we going to check out the box[n]office?

[msg town_new_quest_AEGIS_mes]
Do you not need to stop by the box[n]office?

[msg town_persona_max_RYUJI_m]
I think you're out of room for Personas,[n]man.

[msg town_persona_max_ANN_mes]
You've got way too many Personas!

[msg town_persona_max_MONA_me]
We need to make room for more Personas!

[msg town_persona_max_YUSUKE_]
We can't hold any more Personas...

[msg town_persona_max_FUTABA_]
You can't hold any more Personas!

[msg town_persona_max_AKECHI_]
It doesn't look like we can hold any[n]more Personas.

[msg town_persona_max_P3HERO2]
Looks like our Persona stock's all full[n]up.

[msg town_persona_max_MAKOTO_]
We've got all the Personas we can carry.

[msg town_persona_max_HARU_me]
It looks like we can't hold any more[n]Personas...

[msg town_persona_max_P4HERO_]
Looks like your Persona stock's still[n]full...

[msg town_persona_max_CHIE_me]
Whoa, you've got way too many Personas!

[msg town_persona_max_YUKIKO_]
I think that's all the Personas we can[n]carry...

[msg town_persona_max_RISE_me]
You're all full up on Personas.

[msg town_persona_max_KANJI_m]
We can't hold any more Personas?

[msg town_persona_max_NAOTO_m]
You can't hold any more Personas...

[msg town_persona_max_KUMA_me]
You got way too many Bearsonas on your[n]hands!

[msg town_persona_max_YOUSUKE]
Looks like you have way too many[n]Personas.

[msg town_persona_max_YUKARI_]
Isn't your Persona stock full?

[msg town_persona_max_JUNPEI_]
Hey, uh, you realize you got Personas[n]out the wazoo?

[msg town_persona_max_SANADA_]
Looks like you've carrying too many[n]Personas...

[msg town_persona_max_MITURU_]
Your Persona stock is utterly full.

[msg town_persona_max_FUKA_me]
It looks like you're full up on[n]Personas...

[msg town_persona_max_AMADA_m]
It looks like you can't carry any more[n]Personas.

[msg town_persona_max_ARAGAKI]
Hey. Persona stock's full.

[msg town_persona_max_P3HERO_]
I think that's all the Personas we can[n]carry...

[msg town_persona_max_AEGIS_m]
Our Persona stock is at maximum[n]capacity!

[msg town_item_max_RYUJI_mes]
Think we can lighten the load?

[msg town_item_max_ANN_mes]
You're kinda hoarding a bunch of stuff,[n]huh?

[msg town_item_max_MONA_mes]
Let's sell some treasure and lighten our[n]load.

[msg town_item_max_YUSUKE_mes]
An overstuffed bag is a bit gauche,[n]don't you think?

[msg town_item_max_FUTABA_mes]
Man, you're carrying way too much!

[msg town_item_max_AKECHI_mes]
If I might suggest cleaning out our[n]pack...

[msg town_item_max_P3HERO2_me]
Ahaha, can you believe we're carrying[n]this much stuff?

[msg town_item_max_MAKOTO_mes]
Let's see what we can do to lighten our[n]pack.

[msg town_item_max_HARU_mes]
I think we should probably be carrying[n]less.

[msg town_item_max_P4HERO_mes]
You should make some space in your item[n]bag.

[msg town_item_max_CHIE_mes]
Oh, shoot! We've got way too much stuff.

[msg town_item_max_YUKIKO_mes]
Wouldn't it be better if we lightened[n]our load?

[msg town_item_max_RISE_mes]
Your item bag is totally stuffed!

[msg town_item_max_KANJI_mes]
Yo, bag's full.

[msg town_item_max_NAOTO_mes]
We seem somewhat overloaded.

[msg town_item_max_KUMA_mes]
Hrngh... Our pack's too heavy!

[msg town_item_max_YOUSUKE_me]
You think maybe we could lose some[n]baggage?

[msg town_item_max_YUKARI_mes]
Don't you think we need a little more[n]item space?

[msg town_item_max_JUNPEI_mes]
Dude, your item bag is way too packed!

[msg town_item_max_SANADA_mes]
You have too much stuff! There's no room[n]for protein!

[msg town_item_max_MITURU_mes]
Before we depart, I advise we clean out[n]our bag.

[msg town_item_max_FUKA_mes]
Um, maybe you should clear some[n]inventory space...?

[msg town_item_max_AMADA_mes]
Hold on. I think we're carrying too[n]much.

[msg town_item_max_ARAGAKI_me]
Do you really have to carry all that[n]crap around?

[msg town_item_max_P3HERO_mes]
Hmm... That item bag looks like it's[n]going to burst.

[msg town_item_max_AEGIS_mes]
Inventory status: full!

[msg town_bg00_HIKARI_mes01]
Nagi-san...

[msg town_bg00_HIKARI_mes02]
Yeah...

[msg town_bg00_NAGI_mes01]
Let's try and help as much as we can.

[msg town_bg00_NAGI_mes02]
You don't have to be scared, Hikari-san.

[msg town_bg00_DOE_mes01]
......

[msg town_bg00_ANN_mes01]
Wonder what's up with this place...

[msg town_bg00_ANN_mes02]
Wanna go check out the shop?

[msg town_bg00_ANN_mes03]
Makes you wonder how long those two have[n]been here.

[msg town_bg00_YUSUKE_mes01]
We must sate our hunger first.

[msg town_bg00_YUSUKE_mes02]
No other guests here, it seems...

[msg town_bg00_YUSUKE_mes03]
The tickets aren't free, are they? I[n]don't have much on me...

[msg town_bg00_FUTABA_mes01]
Inari, your stomach's growling too loud[n]again.

[msg town_bg00_FUTABA_mes02]
I'm worried about Makoto and Haru...

[msg town_bg00_FUTABA_mes03]
It's like we rented out a whole dang[n]theater to ourselves!

[msg town_bg00_AKECHI_mes01]
I'd say this phenomenon bears[n]investigating.

[msg town_bg00_AKECHI_mes02]
We should hurry. We need to go save[n]those two.

[msg town_bg00_AKECHI_mes03]
Intriguing! This is a mysterious world[n]indeed...

[msg town_bg01_HIKARI_mes01]
......

[msg town_bg01_HIKARI_mes02]
Um, well... Everyone...

[msg town_bg01_HIKARI_mes03]
A film festival...

[msg town_bg01_RYUJI_mes01]
Holy crap... I can't stop eatin' this.

[msg town_bg01_RYUJI_mes02]
C'mon, would you guys relax?

[msg town_bg01_RYUJI_mes03]
I feel like [f 6 1 30 0 0 0] and would get along[n]great.

[msg town_bg01_MONA_mes01]
Gah, you almost made me spill it!

[msg town_bg01_MONA_mes02]
This juice is pretty tasty!

[msg town_bg01_FUTABA_mes01]
Heheh, too slow!

[msg town_bg01_FUTABA_mes02]
Heeheehee!

[msg town_bg01_P3HERO2_mes01]
I think the closest is Screen Shot on[n]Tatsumi Port Island.

[msg town_bg01_P3HERO2_mes02]
They have a film festival at Screen Shot[n]for summer vacation!

[msg town_bg01_P3HERO2_mes03]
Whoa, you live on the second floor of a[n]caf〒!

[msg town_bg02_HIKARI_mes01]
U-Um... Well...

[msg town_bg02_HIKARI_mes02]
I-I... um...

[msg town_bg02_HIKARI_mes03]
Huh? R-Right!

[msg town_bg02_NAGI_mes01]
Oh my... *giggle*

[msg town_bg02_NAGI_mes02]
Oh, Hikari-san... Hmhmhm.

[msg town_bg02_MAKOTO_mes01]
Have you seen "Like A Dragon,"[n]Hikari-chan?

[msg town_bg02_MAKOTO_mes02]
A paradise for dinosaurs...? I wonder if[n]that really exists...

[msg town_bg02_MAKOTO_mes03]
Is everyone eating well? Dieting can be[n]unhealthy...

[msg town_bg02_HARU_mes01]
I can't wait until "Pach-Saw" is in[n]theaters.

[msg town_bg02_HARU_mes02]
Make sure you eat your vegetables, too.

[msg town_bg02_CHIE_mes01]
Hikari-chan, you ever see "Trial of the[n]Dragon"? The kung fu flick?

[msg town_bg02_CHIE_mes02]
I'm sure we'll find out once we get[n]there! Right, Hikari-chan?

[msg town_bg02_CHIE_mes03]
Meat is the root of all meals! Meat[n]never betrays you!

[msg town_bg02_YUKIKO_mes01]
"One Missed Text" made me laugh so hard[n]my stomach hurt!

[msg town_bg02_YUKIKO_mes02]
*gasp* This must be the fabled ritual[n]known as "girl talk"!

[msg town_bg02_RISE_mes01]
I can't wait for "Roman Paid Holiday."

[msg town_bg02_RISE_mes02]
True, balance is important. Gotta think[n]about nutrition.

[msg town_bg02_RISE_mes03]
Hmm... Shame our sensors can't check[n]further in the labyrinth.

[msg town_bg03_MONA_mes01]
STOP IIIIIIIIT!

[msg town_bg03_MONA_mes02]
Sheesh, get your hands off me! You're[n]messing up my fur.

[msg town_bg03_TEODOA_mes01]
While I may seem to be an object, I'll[n]happily help you at my shop...

[msg town_bg03_YUSUKE_mes01]
Amazing... What an avant- garde shape!

[msg town_bg03_YUSUKE_mes02]
Wait, don't move! At least for another[n]three hours!

[msg town_bg03_AKECHI_mes01]
I'm honored to finally have a chance to[n]chat, Shirogane-san.

[msg town_bg03_AKECHI_mes02]
First, can I hear your thoughts on this,[n]Shirogane-san?

[msg town_bg03_KANJI_mes01]
Hey... C'mon, just a little? A tiny bit![n]Please!

[msg town_bg03_KANJI_mes02]
I-I musta died and gone to fluffy[n]heaven...

[msg town_bg03_NAOTO_mes01]
Well... if I can be of assistance, by[n]all means. Ask away.

[msg town_bg03_NAOTO_mes02]
I think there's quite a bit we can infer[n]from the circumstances...

[msg town_bg03_KUMA_mes01]
Nooo... M-My feet are falling asleep...

[msg town_bg03_KUMA_mes02]
If you stare so much... it makes me feel[n]all itchy...

[msg town_bg04_DOE_mes01]
......

[msg town_bg04_ZABES_mes01]
......

[msg town_bg04_ANN_mes01]
You can knit? Wow! You're so talented!

[msg town_bg04_ANN_mes02]
Ooh, that's amazing! And? And?

[msg town_bg04_ANN_mes03]
You want some juice too, Kanji-kun? Or[n]maybe soda?

[msg town_bg04_P3HERO2_mes01]
Yeah! Let's work together and do our[n]best!

[msg town_bg04_P3HERO2_mes02]
Once we're done with our break, let's[n]head back into the movie!

[msg town_bg04_P4HERO_mes01]
It's reassuring to have more friends on[n]our side.

[msg town_bg04_P4HERO_mes02]
You're right. We'd better stay on guard[n]as we move forward.

[msg town_bg04_KANJI_mes01]
S-Stop starin', dammit, or I'll[n]stockinette stitch you!

[msg town_bg04_KANJI_mes02]
There's lots of kinds of knitting,[n]but... you hook like this, and...

[msg town_bg04_KANJI_mes03]
Nah, soda makes me cough. Just juice is[n]cool.

[msg town_bg05_HIKARI_mes01]
Pamphlets... Maybe I should read them[n]later too?

[msg town_bg05_HIKARI_mes02]
Y-Yeah... I'll be looking forward to it.

[msg town_bg05_TEO_mes01]
Y-Yes! Right away!

[msg town_bg05_RYUJI_mes01]
We're doin' a lot of running, so we[n]gotta keep sugar levels high.

[msg town_bg05_RYUJI_mes02]
Three hot dogs, and a large order of[n]fries! Oh, and some cola.

[msg town_bg05_MAKOTO_mes01]
Ryuji, how much soda have you drunk[n]already?

[msg town_bg05_MAKOTO_mes02]
Ah, that's for the Kamoshidaman movie in[n]Theater 1.

[msg town_bg05_MAKOTO_mes03]
Once we've rested, we should get back[n]into the movie.

[msg town_bg05_YOUSUKE_mes01]
Whoa. They've even got pamphlets out[n]here.

[msg town_bg05_YOUSUKE_mes02]
Heeey, Ryuji! Put in a drink order for[n]me too, would ya?

[msg town_bg05_YOUSUKE_mes03]
Hey, Hikari-chan! I hope you'll look[n]forward to the movie's ending.

[msg town_bg06_HIKARI_mes01]
Mmhm. Good luck to you, Futaba-chan.

[msg town_bg06_HIKARI_mes02]
The power to provide backup, huh...[n]That's amazing...

[msg town_bg06_HIKARI_mes03]
You're good with computers, Futaba-chan?[n]I respect that...

[msg town_bg06_YUSUKE_mes01]
Popcorn's fine, but I kinda wish we had[n]actual food here...

[msg town_bg06_YUSUKE_mes02]
Wh-What is this!? It's delicious!

[msg town_bg06_YUSUKE_mes03]
Protein bars... Are these, too, within[n]Theodore's power...?

[msg town_bg06_FUTABA_mes01]
We're gonna change that movie! Just you[n]watch, Hikari!

[msg town_bg06_FUTABA_mes02]
Yeah, leave it to us!

[msg town_bg06_FUTABA_mes03]
That goes there... gotta just fix this,[n]and... Excellent. Mweheheh...

[msg town_bg06_RISE_mes01]
Now that we've got Fuuka-chan too, we're[n]all set on backup!

[msg town_bg06_RISE_mes02]
We gotta share all our info. Even if it[n]doesn't seem relevant!

[msg town_bg06_SANADA_mes01]
A protein bar, and one of my best. You[n]want more?

[msg town_bg06_ZABES_mes01]
I see...

[msg town_bg06_FUKA_mes01]
We can share the load between us. And[n]now we have Futaba-chan!

[msg town_bg06_FUKA_mes02]
You're right. Let's provide the best[n]backup we can!

[msg town_bg07_DOE_mes01]
......

[msg town_bg07_P3HERO2_mes01]
Aww, there you go... You're such a smart[n]boy, Koromaru!

[msg town_bg07_P3HERO2_mes02]
Ahaha, that tickles! Geez, Koromaru!

[msg town_bg07_HARU_mes01]
Koro-chan is so soft! And so cute!

[msg town_bg07_HARU_mes02]
Hee hee... Your tail is fluffy,[n]Koro-chan.

[msg town_bg07_YUKIKO_mes01]
Kanetsugu, sit!

[msg town_bg07_ZABES_mes01]
My, Teddie-Bear... The flames of[n]jealousy burn bright indeed...

[msg town_bg07_KUMA_mes01]
Grrr... How dare they! I'm standing[n]right here...!

[msg town_bg07_KUMA_mes02]
Grrrrr... That little mutt...

[msg town_bg07_YUKARI_mes01]
Koro-chan's so calming to have around.[n]And he's smart! Good boy!

[msg town_bg07_KOROMARU_mes01]
Arf arf!

[msg town_bg07_KOROMARU_mes02]
Woof!

[msg town_bg07_KOROMARU_mes03]
*pant pant*

[msg town_bg08_FUTABA_mes01]
Whoaaaaa! So cool!

[msg town_bg08_FUTABA_mes02]
Oh hey, Naoto. We're running Ribbon's[n]data against hers!

[msg town_bg08_HARU_mes01]
Fuuka-chan, thank you for all your[n]precise backup.

[msg town_bg08_HARU_mes02]
This coffee has such a rich flavor to[n]it. It's very delicious.

[msg town_bg08_HARU_mes03]
Futaba-chan and Naoto-kun are both so[n]intrigued by Aigis-san.

[msg town_bg08_NAOTO_mes01]
Um, Aigis-san... How do you use that[n]arm?

[msg town_bg08_NAOTO_mes02]
Are you collecting Aigis-san's data,[n]Futaba-san?

[msg town_bg08_ZABES_mes01]
*chuckle* Such moving events! I can feel[n]my heart skip a beat.

[msg town_bg08_FUKA_mes01]
Oh, no, your axewomanship is amazing![n]I'm in awe, Haru-san.

[msg town_bg08_FUKA_mes02]
I see! This tea is so delicious, too.

[msg town_bg08_FUKA_mes03]
Something seems to have caught their[n]attention over there...

[msg town_bg08_AEGIS_mes01]
This arm... is used like this!

[msg town_bg08_AEGIS_mes02]
Once my arms are approved, I will[n]commence "poink" testing.

[msg town_bg09_ZABES_mes01]
My. Koromaru has discovered who was[n]sneaking his snacks...

[msg town_bg09_MONA_mes01]
Would you guys keep it down? I can't[n]relax like this.

[msg town_bg09_MONA_mes02]
Mmm... My expensive sushi... More[n]tuna... Zzz...

[msg town_bg09_MONA_mes03]
Let's go to sleep for the day.

[msg town_bg09_MAKOTO_mes01]
It may help us to try various team[n]member combinations.

[msg town_bg09_MAKOTO_mes02]
This is finally the last one. Let's stay[n]focused.

[msg town_bg09_MAKOTO_mes03]
Ah, well. We can overlook it as long as[n]we're here, I guess.

[msg town_bg09_KUMA_mes01]
Gyaaaaaaah! I'm sorryyyyy!

[msg town_bg09_KUMA_mes02]
I swear, I'm not as delicious as I look!

[msg town_bg09_MITURU_mes01]
Our group's grown. We need to get to[n]know each other.

[msg town_bg09_MITURU_mes02]
I agree. We'll have to brace ourselves[n]from here on.

[msg town_bg09_MITURU_mes03]
Honestly... What a rowdy group. Even[n]Koromaru is riled up now...

[msg town_bg09_KOROMARU_mes01]
Arf!

[msg town_bg09_KOROMARU_mes02]
Grrrrr...

[msg town_bg10_ZABES_mes01]
Veeelvet, oh velvet... My master has a[n]laaarge nooose...

[msg town_bg10_RYUJI_mes01]
Huh. So you guys need this thing to[n]summon yours?

[msg town_bg10_RYUJI_mes02]
Sorry, sorry! Sometimes the hype gets[n]ahold of me.

[msg town_bg10_AKECHI_mes01]
Well, when you put it that way, it's[n]difficult to describe...

[msg town_bg10_AKECHI_mes02]
Of course. But detective work isn't as[n]glamorous as TV portrays it...

[msg town_bg10_AKECHI_mes03]
Do you have any dreams for the future,[n]Amada-kun?

[msg town_bg10_YOUSUKE_mes01]
Damn, Evokers are impressive! They're[n]cool, but kinda scary...

[msg town_bg10_YOUSUKE_mes02]
Gah, you moron! Don't point that thing[n]at me!

[msg town_bg10_JUNPEI_mes01]
Yeah. Put it to your head, pull the[n]trigger, and bam! Persona!

[msg town_bg10_JUNPEI_mes02]
Still freaky even when you know it's an[n]Evoker, right? Same here.

[msg town_bg10_AMADA_mes01]
So you're a detective, Akechi-san? How[n]do you become one?

[msg town_bg10_AMADA_mes02]
Can you teach me more about being a[n]detective later?

[msg town_bg10_AMADA_mes03]
I don't know if it's a dream... but I[n]want to get stronger.

[msg town_bg11_HIKARI_mes01]
You're all amazing! Keep at it!

[msg town_bg11_HIKARI_mes02]
You've got this, Satonaka-san!

[msg town_bg11_HIKARI_mes03]
You're in the lead, Sanada-san! Keep at[n]it, Aragaki-san!

[msg town_bg11_YUSUKE_mes01]
This is truly delicious... I can't stop![n]I won't stop!

[msg town_bg11_YUSUKE_mes02]
The protein-flavored variety isn't too[n]bad, either...

[msg town_bg11_TEO_mes01]
Such appetites! I can barely keep up[n]with popcorn demand!

[msg town_bg11_HARU_mes01]
*giggle* This is the last one. I'll need[n]my strength.

[msg town_bg11_HARU_mes02]
Theodore, may I have some tea? Earl Grey[n]would be lovely.

[msg town_bg11_CHIE_mes01]
Oh man! I didn't know it was possible to[n]chug popcorn!

[msg town_bg11_CHIE_mes02]
Hraaaaaaah! Here it comes! Girl power,[n]unleashed!

[msg town_bg11_CHIE_mes03]
Hrgh, my mouth is all dry... If this[n]were meat, I'd win!

[msg town_bg11_YUKARI_mes01]
Wow, how can they eat so much...?

[msg town_bg11_YUKARI_mes02]
Oh, rose hip tea for me, please!

[msg town_bg11_SANADA_mes01]
That's my win, Shinji!

[msg town_bg11_SANADA_mes02]
Come on, Shinji. Is that the best you[n]got?

[msg town_bg11_ARAGAKI_mes01]
Tch. I can't lose...

[msg town_bg11_ARAGAKI_mes02]
Tch. No way I'm getting beaten by some[n]popcorn-stuffed idiot!

[msg town_bg12_ANN_mes01]
Okay! Let's get fired up!

[msg town_bg12_ANN_mes03]
I'm already going all in. Let's do this.

[msg town_bg12_P4HERO_mes01]
I know we can do this. No matter what.

[msg town_bg12_P4HERO_mes02]
The time's finally come... We can't[n]lose.

[msg town_bg12_P4HERO_mes03]
Let's show her what we're capable of.

[msg town_bg12_YOUSUKE_mes01]
Should we form a circle, or something?

[msg town_bg12_YOUSUKE_mes02]
Let's do this, partner!

[msg town_bg12_YOUSUKE_mes03]
All right. Let's go, guys!

[msg town_bg12_MITURU_mes01]
We should make certain that we're fully[n]prepared.

[msg town_bg12_MITURU_mes02]
Ha... It's time we put an end to this.

[msg town_bg12_MITURU_mes03]
Let's go. Our resolve will decide this.

[msg town_bg12_P3HERO_mes01]
Let's put our strength together.

[msg town_bg12_P3HERO_mes02]
This is something only we can do.

[msg town_bg12_P3HERO_mes03]
Is everyone ready?

[msg town_bg12_AEGIS_mes01]
Let us go, everyone. We shall fight[n]together.

[msg town_bg12_AEGIS_mes02]
I am giving this my all. We will not[n]lose.

[msg town_bg12_AEGIS_mes03]
All preparations complete. Limiters[n]ready to disengage.
