"Special screenings" are manifestations[n]of curious events you discover in[n]movies.
Special screenings tend to diverge[n]greatly from the movie they're based on.
You may discover new twists that would[n]not appear in a normal delve.
Give them a try if you get tired of the[n]usual, or find yourself otherwise stuck.
Should you complete a special screening,[n]you will also earn fine rewards.
I assure you, they are well worth the[n]effort.

[msg NHELP003_QUEST_REWARD_E [Elizabeth]]
When you complete a special screening,[n]you'll be paid your due reward...
However, that isn't the only benefit.
You will also gain a healthy dose of[n]experience points to boost you further.
Regardless of your party composition,[n]the experience will bolster everyone.
You will gain experience and rewards,[n]and I get to see it all on the big[n]screen.
I'd call that win-win for both of us. Do[n]try one if you feel inclined.
Ah, but once you complete a special[n]screening, you cannot revisit it.
As such, I advise you explore them fully[n]before proceeding to completion.

Even after accepting a ticket, it is[n]still possible to discard it.
If you're struggling, or want a[n]different special screening, just[n]discard your ticket.
You can also freely reaccept tickets[n]that you have previously discarded.
Until the special screening is complete,[n]you can accept its ticket all you want.
But wait, there's more! Accepting and[n]discarding tickets is totally free!
Please make use of these offerings,[n]should you feel inclined.
